follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _THE MERGER_

  



  

Section 1.1   _Merger of Merger Sub into East_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
East, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
East shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") as a wholly-owned, direct, Subsidiary of Central.

  



  

Section 1.2   _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all
of the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
East and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of East and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.3   _Closing; Effective Time_. The consummation of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 1000 Louisiana Street, Suite 6800, Houston,
Texas 77002 on a date to be mutually agreed upon by Central and East (the "
_Closing Date_ "), which date shall be no later than the second Business Day
after the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ shall have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or such other time as Central and East shall mutually agree.
Immediately following the Closing, East and Central shall cause a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective upon such filing and acceptance of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such later date and time as agreed by Central and East and as set forth
in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4   _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated pursuant to the Merger in
its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein, subject to _Section 5.8(b)_, or by applicable Law.

  



     

   

2

 



    



  

(b)   The name of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be " _East_."

  



  

(c)  At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibit C_
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be reflected as "
_East_ ") until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, subject to
_Section 5.8(b)_, or by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 1.5   _Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to applicable Law, the parties shall take all actions
necessary such that the persons who are the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and such initial directors shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

  



  

(b)  The parties shall take all action necessary such that the
officers of East immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such initial officers shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

Section 1.6   _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Central, Merger Sub, East or any holder of
capital stock thereof:

  



  

(i)  each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of East (the
" _East Common Stock_ ") held immediately prior to the Effective Time by
Central, Merger Sub or any of Central's other Subsidiaries (together
with Merger Sub, the " _Central Subsidiaries_ "), or by East or any
of East's Subsidiaries (the " _East Subsidiaries_ ") (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

  



  

(ii)  subject to _Section 1.6(b)_ and _Section 1.6(c)_, each
share of East Common Stock issued and outstanding (other than Excluded
Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive from Central 0.5165 fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, $0.10 par value, of Central (the " _Central Common Stock_ ").

  



  

The number of shares of Central Common Stock into which each share of East
Common Stock shall be converted, as specified in _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_ (as
such number may be adjusted in accordance with _Section 1.6(b)_), is
referred to as the " _Exchange Ratio_." The aggregate number of shares of
Central Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_, together with
any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Central Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_, is referred to as the " _Merger
Consideration_."

  



  

(b) Without limiting the parties' respective obligations under
_Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_, including _Section 4.1(b)(i)_ and
_Section 4.2(b)(i)_, if, during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of East Common
Stock or Central Common Stock shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision
or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, then the Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the
effect of such event on the Exchange Ratio or any such other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(c)  No fractional shares of Central Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a holder of Central
Common Stock. Any holder of East Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Central Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger (after taking into account all shares of East Common Stock held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by such holder) shall, in lieu of such
fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder's East Stock
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Common Shares, be paid in cash the dollar amount
specified by _Section 1.8(f)_.

  



  

(d)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Central, Merger Sub, East or any holder of capital
stock thereof, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

Section 1.7   _Closing of East 's Transfer Books_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of East Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and (i) each certificate (an " _East Stock
Certificate_ ") formerly representing any share of East Common Stock (other
than an Excluded Share) and (ii) each Book-Entry Common Share
formerly representing any share of East Common Stock (other than an Excluded
Share) shall represent only the right to receive shares of Central Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Central Common Stock) as
contemplated by _Section 1.6_ and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, and all
holders of East Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Common Shares shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of East; and (b) the stock transfer books of
East shall be closed with respect to all shares of East Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of East Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid East
Stock Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the
Surviving Corporation or Central, such East Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

  



  

Section 1.8   _Exchange Fund; Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Closing Date, Central and East shall mutually
select a bank or trust company, which may be the transfer agent for the
Central Common Stock, to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), and, not later than the Effective Time, Central shall
enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, which will provide that, at
or prior to the Effective Time, Central shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
all of the shares of Central Common Stock to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_ and _Section 1.8(f)_. The
shares of Central Common Stock so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together
with (i) any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with
respect to such shares and (ii) proceeds received from the sale of the Central
Excess Shares pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_ , are referred to collectively as
the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Central shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of East Stock Certificates
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions
as Central and East may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming
that delivery of East Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to East Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
East Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of East Stock Certificates in exchange for Central
Common Stock, as provided in _Section 1.6_, and any cash in lieu of a
fractional share which the shares of East Common Stock represented by such
East Stock Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or distributions to be
paid pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_. Upon surrender of an East Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent or Central, (A) the holder of such East Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in book-entry form the number of
whole shares of Central Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.6_ (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Central Common Stock) as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, and (B) the East Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be immediately canceled.

  



  

(c)  No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to the
Central Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered East
Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such East Stock
Certificate in accordance with this  _Article I_. After the surrender of an
East Stock Certificate in accordance with this _Article I_, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to the whole shares of Central Common Stock which
the shares of East Common Stock represented by such East Stock Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive.

  



  

(d)  Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.8_, each
East Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive shares of Central Common Stock (and cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Central Common Stock) as contemplated by
this _Article I_ and any distribution or dividend with respect to
Central Common Stock the record date for which is after the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)   In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of East
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of East, shares
in book-entry form representing the proper number of shares of Central Common
Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name such East
Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered if such East Stock Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of Central Common Stock to a Person other
than the registered holder of such East Stock Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Central that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
If any East Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Central may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
of any shares in book-entry form representing Central Common Stock require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed East Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Central may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Central or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
East Stock Certificate.

  



  

(f)  

  



  

(i)  As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall (A) determine the number of whole shares of Central
Common Stock and the number of fractional shares of Central Common Stock that
each holder of East Common Stock is entitled to receive in connection with
the consummation of the Merger and (B) aggregate all such fractional shares of
Central Common Stock that would, except as provided in _Section 1.6(c)_, be
issued to the holders of East Common Stock, rounding up to the nearest whole
number (the " _Central Excess Shares_ "), and the Exchange Agent shall, on
behalf of former stockholders of East, sell the Central Excess Shares at then-
prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), all in the
manner provided in _Section 1.8(f)(ii)_.

  



  

(ii)  The sale of the Central Excess Shares by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the
NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The
Exchange Agent shall use reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the
Central Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the
Exchange Agent's sole judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the
best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until
the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the former
holders of East Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in
trust for such holders (the " _East Common Stock Trust_ "). Central shall pay
all commissions and other out-of-pocket transaction costs (other than any
transfer or similar Taxes imposed on a holder of East Common Stock),
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in
connection with such sale of the Central Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of the East Common Stock Trust to which
each former holder of East Common Stock is entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds composing the East Common Stock

December 31, 2019, referred to in East's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the " _East Reserve Report_ "), and (ii)
the report of Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (" _NSAI_ ") regarding
its independent audit, as of December 31, 2019, of certain of the proved
Hydrocarbon reserves of East and the East Subsidiaries referred to in East's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the

Report fairly reflect, in all material respects, the proved Hydrocarbon
reserves of East and the East Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and
are in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC, as applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods reflected therein. Except for
changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally
affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by production, there
has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the East Reserve
Report that would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an East Material Adverse Effect. The estimates of proved
Hydrocarbon reserves used by East and the East Subsidiaries in connection
with the preparation of the East Reserve Report complied in all material
respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, and the
estimates of proved Hydrocarbon reserves provided to NSAI in connection with
the preparation of the East NSAI Audit Report complied in all material
respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.

December 31, 2019, included in the East March 20 8-K/A (the " _Felix Reserve
Report_ ") was based was complete and accurate at the time such data was
provided to NSAI, except for any incompleteness or inaccuracy that would not
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an East
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of East, the proved Hydrocarbon
reserve estimates of NSAI set forth in the Felix Reserve Report fairly
reflect, in all material respects, the proved Hydrocarbon reserves of Felix at
the dates indicated therein. Except for changes (including changes in
Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and
normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the
matters addressed in the Felix Reserve Report that would be reasonably

Effect. To the Knowledge of East, the estimates of proved
Hydrocarbon reserves used in connection with the preparation of the Felix
Reserve Report complied in all material respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation
S-X promulgated by the SEC.

Section 5.1   _Investigation_.

  



  

(a)  Each of East and Central shall afford to the other party
and to the directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of such other party reasonable access
during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries'
personnel and properties (to the extent and only to the extent East or
Central, as applicable, or its respective Subsidiaries has to right to permit
access to such properties), Contracts, commitments, books and records and any
report, schedule or other documents filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional financing, operating
and other data and information regarding East and the East Subsidiaries,
as Central may reasonably request in connection with activities related to
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Activities_ "), or regarding Central and the Central
Subsidiaries, as East may reasonably request in connection with the
Activities, as the case may be, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event
shall access be provided to conduct any invasive sampling, monitoring or other
investigations, including any Phase II assessments or investigations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither East nor Central nor their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to afford such access if it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries,
would cause a violation of any applicable Law, Contract or obligation of
confidentiality to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (
_provided_ that Central or East, as the case may be, has used its reasonable
best efforts to find an alternative way to provide the access or information
contemplated by this _Section 5.1_), cause a risk of a loss of privilege to
such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  The parties hereto hereby agree that all information
provided to them or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be subject to the terms of that certain Confidentiality

Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Central and East shall jointly prepare and each shall file with
the SEC a joint proxy statement in preliminary form, which shall contain each
of the Central Recommendation and the East Recommendation (unless, in either
case, a Central Adverse Recommendation Change or an East Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, occurs) and comply with applicable Laws
(the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ "), and Central shall prepare and file with
the SEC (a) a Registration Statement on Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included, and (b) a prospectus relating to the Central

Merger. Central and East shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after its filing. Each of Central and East
shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Central shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws and other applicable Laws in connection with
the issuance of shares of Central Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and
each party shall furnish all information concerning East, Central and the
holders of capital stock of East and Central, as applicable, as may be
reasonably requested by the other party in connection with any such action and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Registration Statement will be made by Central,
or with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by East, Central or
any of their Subsidiaries, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Central will advise East, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Central Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. Each of Central and East shall advise
the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for the amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to East or
Central, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by East or Central which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party
has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to either the
Central Stockholders or the East Stockholders, as applicable.

Acquisition Proposal with respect to East or any of the modifications
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, East (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the East
Stockholders' Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to
the East Stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the
East Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
East Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct business at such East Stockholders' Meeting and
(ii) may adjourn or postpone the East Stockholders' Meeting if, as of the
time for which the East Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, there are

Stockholders' Meeting if, as of the time for which the Central Stockholders'
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Central Common Stock

intending to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to cause East to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (each, an " _East Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the East Subsidiaries or by
any Representatives of East or any of the East Subsidiaries, whether or not
such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative
is purporting to act on behalf of East or any of the East Subsidiaries or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by East.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to obtaining
the East Stockholder Approval, East and the East Board may take any actions
described in _clause (ii)_ in the first sentence of this _Section 5.4(a)
_with respect to a third party if (w) after the date of this Agreement,
East receives a written Acquisition Proposal with respect to East from such
third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited,
knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by East or any of the East
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), (x) East provides
Central the notice required by _Section 5.4(g) _with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, (y) the East Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with East's financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal with respect to East, and (z) the East Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with East's outside legal counsel) that the
failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to disclose such
information or data to such third party would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties; _provided_ that East shall not deliver any information to
such third party without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such third party. Notwithstanding the
limitations set forth in this _Section 5.4(a)_ and subject to compliance
with East's obligations contained in _Section 5.4(g)_, if East receives,
following the date hereof and prior to the East Stockholders' Meeting, an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
knowing and intentional breach of this _Section 5.4_, East and its
Representatives may contact the Person or any of such
Person's Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal solely to
clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that East may inform itself
about such Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4
_shall prohibit East or the East Board from taking and disclosing to the East
Stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to East pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, the East Board may
make an East Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that
East shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an East Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to East

Central (an " _East Notice_ ") advising Central that the East Board or a
committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or

stockholders as the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change in
the financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a
new East Notice and a new two (2) Business Day period under this _Section
5.4(b)_) and (z) unless the East Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, determines that the failure to make an East Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

any time prior to obtaining the East Stockholder Approval, and subject to
East's compliance in all material respects at all times with the provisions of
this _Section 5.4_ and _Section 5.3_, in response to an East Intervening
Event, the East Board may make an East Adverse Recommendation Change described
in _clause (A)_ of the definition thereof if the East Board (i) determines
in good faith, after consultation with East's outside legal counsel and any
other advisor it chooses to consult, that the failure to make such East
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties, (ii) determines in good faith that the reasons for making such East
Adverse Recommendation Change are independent of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether pending, potential or otherwise) with respect to East and (iii)
provides written notice to Central (an " _East Notice of Change_ ") advising
Central that the East Board is contemplating making an East Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the material facts and information
constituting the basis for such contemplated determination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) the East Board may not make such an East Adverse
Recommendation Change until the third Business Day after receipt by Central
of the East Notice of Change and (y) during such three (3) Business Day
period, at the request of Central, East shall negotiate in good faith with

the East Board not to make such East Adverse Recommendation Change consistent
with its fiduciary duties.

Approval (as applicable), if, in response to an unsolicited request from a
third party to waive any "standstill" or similar provision, the East Board or
Central Board (as applicable) determines in good faith after consultation
with East's or Central's (as applicable) outside legal counsel that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,
East or Central (as applicable) shall be permitted to waive, without
the other's prior written consent, such standstill or similar provision
solely to the extent necessary to permit such third party to make an
Acquisition Proposal to East or Central (as applicable), on a confidential
basis, _provided_ , _however_ , that East or Central (as applicable) shall
advise the other party in writing at least two (2) calendar days prior to
taking such action.

counsel to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Entity in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or

generality of the foregoing, subject to the conditions and upon the terms of
this Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall (i) reasonably cooperate
with the other party, execute and deliver such further documents,

necessary for all filings hereunder); (ii) give all notices (if any) required
to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) use reasonable best

party in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Central,

respective businesses or assets of Central, East or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (ii) neither Central nor East, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall be required to divest or hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, East and the East
Subsidiaries, Central or the Central Subsidiaries, or any of the respective
businesses or assets of Central, East or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, in each case if such divestiture or other action with respect
thereto would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
impair the benefits of the Merger to Central or to have an East Material
Adverse Effect or a Central Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6   _East Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _East Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each stock
option issued under an East Benefit Plan (an " _East Stock Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that by its terms does
not settle by reason of the occurrence of the Closing shall, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Closing and without any action by Central, Merger Sub, East
or the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase East Common
Stock and be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of
Central Common Stock (such option, a " _Converted Stock Option_ ") equal to
the product (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i)
the number of shares of East Common Stock subject to each such East Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_  (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per East Common Stock of such
East Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the
Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Central Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the
Converted Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, as applicable, Section 422 of
the Code. Immediately following the Effective Time, each Converted Stock
Option otherwise shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting, forfeiture and exercisability terms) as were
applicable to the corresponding East Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _East RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit (including those subject to performance-based vesting conditions) under
an East Benefit Plan (an " _East RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that by its terms does not settle by reason of
the occurrence of the Closing shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Closing and without any action by Central, Merger Sub, East or the holder
thereof, be assumed by Central and converted into a number of restricted
stock units with respect to shares (rounded to the nearest number of whole
shares) of Central Common Stock (such restricted stock unit, a "
_Converted RSU_ ") equal to the product of the number of East Common Stock
subject to the East RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied
by_ the Exchange Ratio. Immediately following the Effective Time, each
Converted RSU otherwise shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting and forfeiture) as were applicable to the
corresponding East RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
any performance-based vesting condition that applied to the East RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as having been
attained based on actual results measured using the average five (5) day
closing price of East Common Stock ending on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date as determined by the Compensation Committee of the East Board,
so that such East RSU will remain solely subject to the time-based vesting
requirements in effect for the East RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(c) _East Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock award under an East Benefit Plan (" _East RSA_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that by its term does
not vest by reason of the occurrence of the Closing shall, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Closing and without any action by Central, Merger Sub, East
or the holder thereof, be converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_ into
shares of Central Common Stock and assumed by Central, except the number of
shares subject to such award will be rounded to the nearest number of whole
shares (such restricted stock award, a " _Converted RSA_ "). Immediately
following the Effective Time, each Converted RSA otherwise shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting,
forfeiture and transferability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
East RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)   _ESPP._ East's 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. For
any offering period in effect under the ESPP prior to the Closing, East shall

participation in the ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
ESPP). The amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under
the ESPP as of immediately prior to the ESPP Exercise Date shall, to the
extent not used to purchase East Common Stock in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the ESPP and this _Section 5.6(d)_, be refunded to such

interest).

  



  

(e)   _Section 409A_. To the extent that any award described in
this _Section 5.6_ constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, any payment contemplated hereby with respect to such
award shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable
award's terms or, if later, at the earliest time permitted under the terms of
such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(f)   _Required Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the East
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any East
Benefit Plan) shall take all such actions as are necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.6_, including making
any determinations or adopting resolutions of the East Board or a committee
thereof or any administrator of an East Benefit Plan as may be necessary.
Central shall take such actions as are necessary for the conversion of the
East RSUs, East RSAs and East Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 5.6_,
including reservation, issuance and listing of shares of Central Common Stock
as are necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section
5.6_. Central shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration
statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the
shares of Central Common Stock subject to the Converted Stock Options,
Converted RSAs and Converted RSUs and, where applicable, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared
effective as of the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement covering the Converted Stock Options, Converted RSAs
and Converted RSUs (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein) for so long as the Converted Stock Options,
Converted RSAs and Converted RSUs remain outstanding.

  



  

Section 5.7   _Employee and Labor Matters_.

  



  

(a) The following provisions shall apply with respect to the
compensation and benefits to be provided after the Effective Time in respect
of individuals who are employees of East or any of the East Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (the " _East Employees_ ") and to individuals who are
employees of Central or any of the Central Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time (the " _Central Employees_ " and, together with the East Employees, the
" _Employees_ "):

  



  

(i)  East and Central have agreed that, consistent with the
current practices of East and Central, East and Central will seek after the
Effective Time to attract and retain superior quality executive, managerial,
technical and administrative personnel in every market in which they conduct
activities and will generally implement compensation and benefit plans and
policies necessary or appropriate to achieve this objective. It is the
specific intention that, in each of the markets in which they operate,
the compensation and benefit programs of East and Central will be competitive
with those provided generally in their industry, both with respect to the
type and variety of programs as well as the level of benefits afforded.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(ii)  Without limiting the generality of _clause (i)_, above,
except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, and subject to applicable Law
and any obligations under any Labor Agreement, East and Central agree that,
unless otherwise mutually determined before the Effective Time, (I) for the
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year following the
Effective Time, the base pay and post termination severance pay,
respectively, of the Employees shall not be reduced, (II) for the period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2021, the target
incentive compensation opportunities of the Employees shall not be reduced,
(III) for the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2021, (A) each East Employee shall be provided employee benefits that are
substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than either those provided to
such East Employee immediately before the Effective Time or those provided
from time to time to similarly situated Central Employees and (B) each
Central Employee shall be provided employee benefits that are substantially no
less favorable in the aggregate than either those provided to such Central
Employee immediately before the Effective Time or those provided from time to
time to similarly situated East Employees.

  



  

(iii)  East and Central agree that, for the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2021, East Employees will continue
to receive or be entitled to receive an annual employer charitable matching
contribution of up to $10,000 per East Employee (less any amount matched by
East or any East Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date during such year).

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable Law and any obligations under any
Labor Agreement, for all purposes under the benefit and compensation plans
of Central and the Central Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Employees
after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each East Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with East and the East Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time, and each Central Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with Central and the Central Subsidiaries before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before
the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar East Benefit
Plan or Central Benefit Plan, as applicable; _provided_  that such service
crediting shall not be required (i) to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits, nor (ii) to the extent East Employees and Central
Employees are affected without regard to whether employment before the
Effective Time was with East and the East Subsidiaries or Central and the
Central Subsidiaries (for example, in the event a New Plan is adopted for
East Employees and Central Employees under which no participants receive
credit for service before the effective date of the New Plan). In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of
this paragraph (b): (i) each Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable East Benefit
Plan or Central Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the  " _Old Plans_ ");
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Employee, Central shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Central shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(c)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
from and after the Effective Time, East and Central shall honor, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms (including
terms related to the amendment or termination thereof), each employment,
severance and termination agreement between East or Central, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and any current or former officer, director or
employee of any such company, to the extent such terms are in effect on the
date hereof.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained in this _Section 5.7_ (whether express
or implied) shall (i) create or confer any rights, remedies or claims upon
any employee, director, officer, or individual service provider or any right
of employment or engagement or continued employment or engagement or any
particular term or condition of employment or engagement for any Employee or
any other Person, (ii) be considered or deemed to establish, amend, or modify
any Central Benefit Plan, East Benefit Plan, New Plan, or any other benefit
or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement, or contract, or
(iii) confer any rights or benefits (including any third-party beneficiary
rights) on any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. The provisions
of this _Section 5.7_ shall not be construed to prevent the termination of
employment of any Employee or the amendment or termination of any
particular East Benefit Plan or Central Benefit Plan to the extent permitted
by its terms and subject to compliance with the terms of this  _Section
5.7_.

  



  

(e)  Prior to making any broad-based communication or written
communications pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including any
schedules hereto), each party shall provide the other party with a copy of
the intended communication, and such other party shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication. East and Central
shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

  



  

(f) It is acknowledged and agreed that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change of control" (or
"change in control" or transaction of similar import) for purposes of the
arrangements identified on _Section 5.7(f)_ of the East Disclosure Letter or
Central Disclosure Letter, as the case may be.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(g)  Prior to the Closing, Central and East shall cooperate in
good faith to determine the timing and manner in which Central or East, or
their respective Subsidiaries, utilize or waive the employment tax deferral or
employee retention credit relief provided under Sections 2301, 2302 and 3606
of the CARES Act, as applicable.

  



  

Section 5.8   _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, each of Central and the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and
advance expenses in connection therewith) each present and former director
and officer of (i) East or any of the East Subsidiaries or (ii) any other
Entity that was serving in such capacity at East's request (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals' fees
and disbursements), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to
which such Indemnified Party is a party or is otherwise involved (including as
a witness), and arises out of or pertains to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer or director of East or any of the East
Subsidiaries, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
advancement of expenses of individuals who were directors and officers prior
to the Effective Time than are set forth, as of the date of this Agreement, in
East's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

  



  

(c)  The Surviving Corporation (or Central on the Surviving
Corporation's behalf) shall, in its sole discretion, either (i) continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time for the Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are
covered by East's directors' and officers' liability insurance (the, " _D
andO Insurance_") with recognized insurance companies and with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in East's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if
such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Corporation or Central on the
Surviving Corporation's behalf shall purchase the best available DandO
Insurance from a recognized insurance company for such six-year period with
terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in East's existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or (ii) obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
with recognized insurance companies for the Persons who, as of the date of
this Agreement, are covered by East's existing DandO Insurance, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as East's
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), with respect to East's DandO
Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in no
event shall Central or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies an annual premium amount in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by East for such insurance; and
_provided further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation (or Central on the Surviving
Corporation's behalf) shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(d) In the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any claims are made in respect of which
such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 5.8(d)_, any Indemnified Party wishing to claim such
indemnification shall promptly notify Central thereof in writing, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Central or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices Central or the Surviving
Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation: (i) Central or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof (it being understood that by electing to assume
the defense thereof, neither Central nor the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Party's
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto or assumed any
liability with respect thereto), except that if Central or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or legal counsel for the
Indemnified Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts
of interest between Central or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party may retain legal counsel satisfactory to Central
and to the provider of any insurance obtained in accordance with the foregoing
_Section 5.8(c)_, and Central or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel for
the Indemnified Party as statements therefor are received; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) Central and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this _Section 5.8(d)_ to pay for only one firm of legal counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one legal
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such legal counsel with a
conflict of interest (in which case the fewest number of legal counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used) and (2) the
Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay all such fees,
costs or expenses paid by Central or the Surviving Corporation if and to the
extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final judgment that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified by Central or the Surviving Corporation; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if Central or the
Surviving Corporation elects to assume such defense; (iii) Central and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent and the prior written consent of the provider of
any insurance obtained in accordance with the foregoing _Section 5.8(c)_, in
each case if Central or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense; and (iv) Central and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnified action of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Central nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any claim, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (and in
which indemnification could be sought by Indemnified Parties hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
claim, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents in writing.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(e)  If Central or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or Entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other Entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made (whether by operation of law or otherwise) so that the
successors and assigns of Central or the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

  



  

(f)  The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives,
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Central and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in any manner that is adverse to the
Indemnified Parties (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, heirs and legal representatives) affected thereby.

  



  

(g)  The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section
5.8_ shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have
under the East Organizational Documents or under any applicable Contracts or
Laws in effect on the date of this Agreement and, in the case of such
documents and Contracts, disclosed to Central prior to the execution hereof,
and Central shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by East or any of
the East Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed to
Central prior to the execution hereof, and any provisions under any such
applicable Contracts (including such indemnification agreements) shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would materially
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individual.

  



  

Section 5.9   _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release
relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release and
thereafter Central and East shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such consultation shall be required if, prior to the date of such
release or public statement, an East Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Central Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in compliance in
all respects with the terms of _Section 5.4_ of this Agreement. No provision
of this Agreement shall prohibit either East or Central from issuing any
press release or public statement in the event of an East Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Central Adverse Recommendation Change that is in
either case in compliance in all respects with the terms of _Section 5.4_
of this Agreement.

subsequent listing application (" _Subsequent Listing Application_
") covering the shares of Central Common Stock to be issued to East
Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, upon Central's request, East shall
take all actions necessary to be taken prior to Closing to cause the
delisting of East Common Stock from the NYSE and the termination of East's
registration of East Common Stock under the Exchange Act, in each case, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with
East's obligations under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 5.11   _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
each of Central, East, the Central Board and the East Board, to the extent
permissible under applicable Laws, will grant such approvals and take such
actions, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, as are necessary so
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Termination Date, on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and
otherwise, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, act to eliminate
the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.12   _Section 16_. Central shall, prior to the Effective
Time, cause the Central Board to approve the issuance of Central equity
securities in connection with the Merger with respect to any employees of East
who, as a result of their relationship with Central as of or following the
Effective Time, are subject or will become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent necessary for
such issuance to be an exempt acquisition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3. Prior to
the Effective Time, the East Board shall approve the disposition of East
equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with the
Merger by those directors and officers of East subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent necessary for
such disposition to be an exempt disposition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3.

  



  

Section 5.13   _Notice of Changes_. Each of East and Central shall give
prompt written notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other
informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon
it obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination
Date.

  



  

Section 5.14   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Each of East and Central will (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and (ii) not take (and will prevent
any Affiliate of such party from taking) any actions that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Reorganization Treatment_
").

  



  

   

80

 



    

   



  

(b) East and Central will use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with one another in connection with the issuance of any opinion
of counsel relating to the Reorganization Treatment (including in connection
with the filing or effectiveness of the Registration Statement), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the relevant counsel
certificates (dated as of the necessary date and signed by an officer of East
or Central, as applicable) substantially in the form attached hereto as

_Central Officer 's Certificate_"), as applicable.

  



  

(c)  Each of East and Central will notify the other party
promptly after becoming aware of any reason to believe that the Merger may
not qualify for the Reorganization Treatment.

  



  

(d)  This Agreement is intended to constitute and be adopted as
a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code
and within the meaning of Treasury Regulations §§ 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

Agreement or the East Loan Agreement, as applicable, as of the anticipated

payment instructions and (c) evidence the satisfaction, release and discharge
of the Indebtedness under the East Credit Agreement or the East Loan

(b) If requested by Central, East shall, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates and Representatives to use its and their reasonable

thereof consent to certain amendments to such indentures (the "
_Consent Solicitations_ " and, together with the Offers to Purchase and
Offers to Exchange, if any, the  " _East Note Offers and Consent

using consideration provided by Central, Central shall be responsible for all
other liabilities, fees and expenses incurred by East or any East Subsidiary
in connection with any East Notes Offers and Consent Solicitations and no
Offer to Purchase or Offer to Exchange shall be consummated prior to Closing.
Any East Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be made on customary
terms and conditions (including price to be paid and conditionality) as

applicable indentures and applicable Laws, including applicable rules and

effective until Closing. At Central's expense, East shall, and shall cause
the East Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective controlled Affiliates and Representatives to, on a
timely basis, upon the reasonable request of Central, provide reasonable
assistance and cooperation in connection with any East Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations, including but not limited to using reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause East's independent accountants (and certified
independent auditors of any Entity recently acquired or whose acquisition by
East is pending of whose financial statements would be required to be included
in order for a registration statement on Form S-1 filed by East to be
declared effective) to provide customary consents for use of their reports
and to provide customary comfort letters (including "negative assurances"
comfort) for the financial information relating to East and the East
Subsidiaries (including any Entity recently acquired by East or whose
acquisition by East is pending), in each case, to the extent required in
connection with any East Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, (ii) cause
East's Representatives to furnish any customary certificates, legal opinions
or negative assurance letters in connection with the East Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations, (iii) provide reasonable cooperation to the
underwriters, dealer managers or similar agents in any East Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations in connection with their related diligence activities,
including providing access to documentation reasonably requested by such
persons, and (iv) provide reasonable assistance in the preparation of
customary documentation, including prospectuses, offers to purchase or
similar documents (which may incorporate, by reference, periodic and current
reports filed by East with the SEC). The dealer manager, solicitation agent,
information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any
East Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected by the Central
and be reasonably acceptable to East and the fees and expenses of such
agents will be paid directly by Central.

  



  

Section 5.16 _Shareholder Litigation_. East shall give Central a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of

no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Central, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Central shall give East a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Central or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger and the other transactions

cooperate, shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
cooperate and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to cooperate in the defense against such litigation.

Sub or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability

Merger Sub as a result of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only East shall be liable
for damages for such fraud or Willful and Material Breach); and (B) Central
and Merger Sub against East and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future directors, officers, stockholders, Representatives
or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger

its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
directors, officers, stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b)   _Authority; No Violation_. Such Stockholder has full
organizational power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this

validly approved by the governing authority of such Stockholder and no other
organizational proceedings on the part of such Stockholder are necessary to

lien, claim, mortgage, encumbrance, pledge, deed of trust, security interest,
equity or charge of any kind (each, a " _Lien_ ") upon any of the Subject
Shares pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party, or by which it
or any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the
case of this clause (z), for such matters that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair the ability of such Stockholder to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _The Subject Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement,
such Stockholder is the beneficial owner of and, together with the applicable
controlling entity or entities of such Stockholder set forth on _Schedule A_
hereto (as applicable, the " _Controlling Entities_ "), has the sole right to
vote and dispose of the Subject Shares set forth opposite such Stockholder's
name on _Schedule A_ hereto, free and clear of any Liens whatsoever, except

purposes, EnCap Energy Capital Fund X, L.P., Skye Callantine and Michael
Horton (the " _Stockholders ' Agreement_"), none of the Subject Shares is
subject to any voting trust or other similar agreement, arrangement or
restriction, except as contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, other than the Stockholders' Agreement (i) there
are no agreements or arrangements of any kind, contingent or otherwise,
obligating such Stockholder to sell, transfer (including by tendering into
any tender or exchange offer), assign, grant a participation interest in,
option, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber, including by
operation of law or otherwise (each, a " _Transfer_ "), or cause to be
Transferred, any of the Subject Shares, other than a Transfer, such as a
hedging or derivative transaction, with respect to which such Stockholder
(and/or its Controlling Entities) retains its Subject Shares and the sole
right to vote, dispose of and exercise dissenters' rights with respect to its
Subject Shares during the Applicable Period (as defined below), and (ii) no
Person has any contractual or other right or obligation to purchase or
otherwise acquire any of the Subject Shares. Other than the Subject Shares,
such Stockholder does not own any equity interests or other equity-
based securities in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d)   _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit,
claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending, or to the knowledge of
such Stockholder, threatened against such Stockholder, or any property or
asset of such Stockholder, before any Governmental Entity that seeks to delay
or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(e)   _No Consents Required_. No consent of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Person or Governmental Entity is required to
be obtained or made by or with respect to such Stockholder in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and except for
any applicable requirements and filings with the SEC, if any, under the
Exchange Act and except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not prevent or delay the performance by such Stockholder of such
Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  



  

(f)   _Reliance_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges
that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Stockholder's execution and delivery of this Agreement.

is a sophisticated seller with respect to the Subject Shares and has adequate
information concerning the business and financial condition of Parent to make
an informed decision regarding the Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby and has independently and without reliance upon Parent and based on
such information as such Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Such Stockholder
acknowledges that Parent has not made and does not make any representation or
warranty, whether express or implied, of any kind or character except as
expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement and this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the elimination of doubt, such
Stockholder is not waiving and is expressly preserving any claims that might
arise in connection with the Registration Statement contemplated to be filed
in connection with the Merger.

(b)   _Authority; No Violation_. Parent has full corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement have been duly and validly approved by the Board of
Directors of Parent and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent

validly executed and delivered by Parent and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Stockholders) this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Neither

the governing documents of Parent or the certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or similar governing documents of any of Parent's Subsidiaries, (y) violate
any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree

required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected. 

  



  

3.   _Covenants of Each Stockholder_. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees as follows; _provided_ that all of the following covenants shall apply solely to actions taken by such Stockholder in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company:

  



  

(a) _Agreement to Vote Subject Shares_. During the Applicable
Period, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or
at any postponement or adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance upon
which a vote or other approval of all or some of the stockholders of the
Company is sought, such Stockholder shall, and shall cause any holder of
record of its Subject Shares on any applicable record date to, vote: (i) in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of any other matter
that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the Company in order to
effect the Merger; (ii) against any merger agreement or merger (other than
the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation, combination, sale or
transfer of a material amount of assets, reorganization, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or any of its

such transaction is approved in writing by Parent) or any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company; and (iii) against any amendment of
the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other proposal or
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which amendment
or other proposal or transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate,
prevent or nullify the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the
voting rights of any outstanding class of capital stock of the Company. During
the Applicable Period, such Stockholder (and/or its Controlling Entities)
shall retain at all times the right to vote all of its Subject Shares in
such Stockholder's sole discretion and without any other limitation on those
matters other than those set forth in this _Section 3(a)_ that are at any
time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Company's
stockholders generally. During the Applicable Period, in the event that any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company is held, such Stockholder shall
(or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to) appear
at such meeting or otherwise cause all of its Subject Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. During the Applicable
Period, such Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree, and to cause
any record holder of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree, to take any
action inconsistent with the foregoing during the Applicable Period. "

this _Section 3(b)_ , such Stockholder agrees not to, and to cause any record
holder of its Subject Shares, not to, in any such case directly or indirectly,
during the Applicable Period (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option
or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with
respect to the Transfer of, any of its Subject Shares (or any interest
therein) to any Person, other than the exchange of its Subject Shares for
Parent Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (ii) grant any
proxies, or deposit any of its Subject Shares into any voting trust or enter
into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or
otherwise, with respect to its Subject Shares, other than pursuant to this
Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 3(b)_ , such
Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take, and to cause any
record holder of any of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree to take,
any of the foregoing actions during the Applicable Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such Stockholder shall have the right to (a) Transfer its
Subject Shares to an Affiliate if and only if such Affiliate shall have
agreed in writing, in a manner acceptable in form and substance to Parent, (i)
to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement as if it were
"a Stockholder" for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Subject Shares in a transaction, such as a hedging or derivative transaction,
with respect to which such Stockholder retains the sole right to vote,
dispose of and exercise dissenters' rights with respect to its Subject
Shares during the Applicable Period; _provided_ that no such transaction shall
(x) in any way limit any of the obligations of such Stockholder under this
Agreement, or (y) have any adverse effect on the ability of the Stockholders
to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _Reserved_.

  



  

(d)   _Adjustment to Subject Shares_. In case of a stock
dividend or distribution, or any change in the Company Common Stock by reason
of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term "Subject Shares" shall
be deemed to refer to and include the Subject Shares as well as all such
stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which
any or all of the Subject Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are
received in such transaction.

  



  

(e)   _Non-Solicitation_. Except to the extent that the Company
or its Board of Directors is permitted to do so under the Merger Agreement,
but subject to any limitations imposed on the Company or its Board of
Directors under the Merger Agreement, such Stockholder agrees, solely in its
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, that it shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate
or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company, (ii) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or
data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that
has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or to any Person

Company, or (iii) approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent,

acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement

  



  

or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to,

intending to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to cause the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder will, and
will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company. Nothing contained in this _Section 3(e)_ shall
prevent any Person affiliated with such Stockholder who is a director or
officer of the Company or designated by such Stockholder as a director of
officer of the Company from taking actions in his capacity as a director or
officer of the Company, including taking any actions permitted under Section
5.4 of the Merger Agreement.

9

 



    



  

(ii)  No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy
is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

  



  

(i)   _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder will, from time
to time, (i) at the request of Parent take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and (ii) execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further

statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be

Each Stockholder signs individually solely on behalf of itself and not on behalf of any other Stockholder.

  



  

9. _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy of any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that with respect to any damage claim that might be brought against any Stockholder or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement, and without regard to whether such claim sounds in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory of relief, that damages are limited to actual damages and expressly waive any right to recover special damages, including, without limitation, lost profits as well as any punitive or exemplary damages. In the event of any litigation over the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in any such litigation shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such litigation. The parties hereto further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents that each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts listed in this _Section 9_ in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that each party hereto irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum and all other defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding, and (c) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any claim or proceeding related to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE ANY OF SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9_.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

10.   _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or any other Person any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. Subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Stockholder, and this Agreement shall not confer any right, power or authority upon Parent or any other Person to direct the Stockholders in the voting of any of the Subject Shares (except as otherwise specifically provided for herein).

(d)  If at any time the Investor Director is serving on the

the Investor is entitled to designate an Investor Director pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ , whether due to the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office as a member of the Board of the
Investor Director or otherwise, the Board shall take all Necessary Action
required to fill the vacancy resulting therefrom with such
replacement designated by the Investor as promptly as practicable. In
furtherance thereof, the Company and the Board shall use its reasonable best
efforts, if requested by the Investor on a timely basis, to fill such vacancy
prior to the time the Board next takes action on any other matter.

  



  

Section 3.3   _Compensation; Indemnification_. The Investor
Director shall be entitled to the same expense reimbursement and

Section 3.4   _Selection of the Investor Director; Committees_.

  



  

(a)  The Investor Director's service as a member of the Board
must be reasonably acceptable to the Governance Committee. The parties hereto
agree that the person listed on _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement is qualified
for service pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Subject to applicable Law and
stock exchange rules, until the Board Designation Expiration Date, the
Investor Director shall be appointed to serve on the Governance Committee,
subject to any limitations imposed by Law or stock exchange rules (including
with respect to director independence requirements).

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Investor shall not be entitled to designate any Investor Director pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ to the Board if the Board or a committee thereof reasonably
determines that (i) the election of such Investor Director to the Board would
cause the Company to not be in compliance with applicable Law or (ii) such
Investor Director has been involved in any of the events that would be
required to be disclosed in a registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to
Item 401(f)(2)-(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 or is
subject to any order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Entity
prohibiting service as a director of any public company. In any such case
described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Investor shall withdraw the designation of such proposed Investor
Director, and, subject to the requirements of this _Section 3.4(b)_ be
permitted to designate a replacement therefor (which replacement Investor
Director will also be subject to the requirements of this _Section 3.4(b)_).
The Company hereby agrees that the Investor Director listed on _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement would not be prohibited from serving on the Board pursuant
to clause (i) of the first sentence of this _Section 3.4(b)_.

  



  

(c)  Subject to _Section 3.7_, the Board may impose as a
condition to the Investor Director serving on the Board that such Investor
Director agree to, and be subject to, each Subject Policy. For the avoidance
of doubt, no Subject Policy shall modify any of the rights and obligations of
the parties to this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement between the
parties dated as of the date hereof, the Merger Agreement or any other
agreement entered into between the parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Lock-up_. The Investor shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and continuing for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date (the " _Lock-up Period_ "), (a) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell,
grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, give, assign, hypothecate,
pledge, encumber, grant a security interest in, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of (including
through any hedging or other similar transaction) any economic, voting or
other rights in or to the Issued Shares, or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
directly or indirectly, or (b) enter into any swap or other agreement that
transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of the Issued Shares (any such transaction described in clause (a) or (b)
above, a " _Transfer_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 3.5_ shall not apply to (i) Transfers involving in
the aggregate no more than [●]1 shares of Common Stock (as appropriately
adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction), (ii)
Transfers to Permitted Transferees; _provided, however_ , that if such
Permitted Transferee is EnCap or any of its Controlled Affiliates, EnCap or
such Controlled Affiliate must agree in an executed written agreement (a copy
of which will be delivered to the Company) for the benefit of the Company to
be bound by the terms of this _Section 3.5_ prior to such Transfer or
distribution, as applicable, and that any Permitted Transferee that is an
Affiliate of EnCap and does not otherwise qualify as a Permitted Transferee
shall also agree that such Person shall Transfer such shares of Common Stock
back to EnCap if, during the Lock-Up Period, such Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of EnCap, or (iii) any Transfers made in connection with any tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other similar
transaction approved or recommended by the Board or a committee thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, EnCap shall not be entitled to distribute
shares of Common Stock to its limited partners during the Lock-Up Period. In
connection with any Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, the Company agrees to
not take any action that would cause such Transfer to be subject to
requirements imposed by any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or any other anti-takeover statute or
similar statute enacted under applicable Law (" _Takeover Laws_ "), and, at
the request of the Investor, will take all reasonable steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transfer from the
Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to such transaction.

Section 3.6 _Waiver of Corporate Opportunities_. It is hereby
acknowledged that members of the Investor Group participate in, and own and
will own substantial equity interests in other entities (existing and future)
that participate in, the energy industry (" _Portfolio Companies_ ") and
may make investments and enter into advisory service agreements and other
agreements from time to time with those Portfolio Companies. Any individual
who serves as the Investor Director may also serve as an employee, partner,
officer, director, or member of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies
and, at any given time, members of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies
may be in direct or indirect competition with the Company and/or its
subsidiaries. The Company waives, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the
application of the doctrine of corporate opportunity (or any analogous
doctrine) with respect to the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies or the
Investor Director. As a result of such waiver, no member of the Investor
Group or Portfolio Companies, nor the Investor Director, shall have any
obligation to refrain from: (A) engaging in or managing the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
developing or marketing any products or services that compete (directly or
indirectly) with those of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B)
acquiring assets in the same or similar areas of operation and lines of
business of the Company; (C) investing in, owning or disposing of any (public
or private) interest in any Person engaged in the same or similar activities
or lines of business as, or otherwise in competition with, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (including any member of the Investor Group, a "
_Competing Person_ "); (D) developing a business relationship with any
Competing Person; or (E) entering into any agreement to provide any
service(s) to any Competing Person or acting as an officer, director, member,
manager or advisor to, or other principal of, any Competing Person,
regardless (in the case of each of clauses (A) through (E)) of whether such
activities are in direct or indirect competition with the business or
activities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the activities
described in clauses (A) through (D) are referred to herein as  " _Specified
Activities_ "). To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company hereby
renounces (for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries) any interest
or expectancy in, or in being notified of or offered an opportunity to
participate in, any Specified Activity that may be presented to or become
known to any member of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies or the
Investor Director. Nothing in this _Section 3.6_ shall be construed to limit
or waive any right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any
express written agreement between the Company and/or one or more of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any member of the Investor Group, any
Portfolio Company, or any of their respective employees, partners, officers,
directors or members, on the other hand.

  



  



  

  

1 _Note to Draft_ : To be equal to 1/3 of the Issued Shares.

Section 3.7   _Amendment to Organizational Documents_. The Company
shall not amend, or propose to amend, the Organizational Documents in any
manner that is inconsistent with or would nullify or supersede any of the
terms of this Agreement or would prevent any party hereto from complying with
its obligations hereunder unless such proposed amendment is approved by the
Investor.

the Lock-up Period, (b) the Investor and its Permitted Transferees ceasing to

parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations provided

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Confidentiality_. Each of the Investor and EnCap shall
hold, and cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees, agents, consultants, auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, financing sources and other consultants and advisors ("
_Representatives_ ") to hold, in strict confidence, unless disclosure to a
regulatory authority is necessary in connection with any necessary regulatory
approval, examination or inspection or unless disclosure is required by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirement of law or the
applicable requirements of any regulatory agency or relevant stock exchange
(in which case, other than in connection with a disclosure in connection with
a routine audit or examination by, or document request from, a regulatory or
self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or auditor, the party disclosing such
information shall provide the other party with prior written notice of such
permitted disclosure), all nonpublic records, books, contracts,
instruments, computer data and other data and information (collectively, "
_Information_ ") concerning the Company, East or any of their respective
subsidiaries furnished to it or the Investor Director by or on behalf of the
Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries (except to the extent
that such information can be shown by the party receiving such Information to
have been (a) previously known by such party from other sources; _provided_
 that such source was not known by such party to be bound by a contractual,
legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the other party, (b) in
the public domain through no violation of this _Section 5.10_ by such party
or (c) later lawfully acquired from other sources by the party to which it
was furnished), and no such party shall release or disclose such Information
to any other person, except its Representatives (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Portfolio Company, unless such Portfolio Company enters into a
joinder agreement with the Company), or use such Information other than in
connection with evaluating and taking actions with respect to such Person's
ownership interest in the Company. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
the Investor and EnCap may, in the ordinary course of their
respective businesses, evaluate investments in the energy industry and that
they are actively seeking to invest in energy related projects in a variety
of areas, including the provision of fresh water and disposal of produced
water in connection with oil and gas exploration and development operations.
The Company understands that the Investor, EnCap and the Investor
Director will retain certain mental impressions of Information, which are
indistinguishable from generalized industry knowledge. Accordingly, the
Company agrees that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Investor,
EnCap and the Investor Director are not precluded from pursuing investments
solely because of such retained mental impressions. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement
shall apply to any action taken independently by any Portfolio Company so
long as the Investor or EnCap has not provided such Portfolio Company with any
Information. For purposes of clarification, no such Portfolio Company shall
be deemed to have been provided with Information solely as a result of
the Investor, EnCap, any Investor Director or any Representative (whether
such Person has been provided with or has knowledge of Information) serving
on the board of such Portfolio Company (provided that such board member does
not use Information in connection with the business of such Portfolio
Company).

registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the resale of the
Registrable Securities from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the

with the Commission in accordance with Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act
(an  " _ASR Filing_ "). If the Shelf Registration Statement does not qualify
as an ASR Filing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Registration Statement to become or be declared effective as soon
as practicable after the filing thereof and, in any event, within 45 days
after the date of this Agreement in the case of a Shelf Registration
Statement on Form S-3 or 90 days after the date of this Agreement in the case

the Shelf Registration Statement that is not an ASR Filing, the Company shall
notify the Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(b)  The Shelf Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 or,
if Form S-3 is not then available to the Company, on Form S-1 or such other
form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration
for resale of such Registrable Securities and shall contain a prospectus in
such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar rule
adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time beginning on the
effective date for such Registration Statement. The Shelf Registration
Statement shall provide for the distribution or resale pursuant to any method
or combination of methods legally available to the Holders.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended as promptly as practicable to the extent necessary to
ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another Registration Statement is available (which
Registration Statement shall also be referred to herein as the Shelf
Registration Statement), for the resale of all the Registrable Securities
until all of the Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities or the earlier termination of this Agreement (as to all Holders).

  



  

(d)  When effective, the Shelf Registration Statement (including
the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
prospectus contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made).

  



  

Section 2.2   _Underwritten Shelf Offering Requests_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Holder or group of Holders elects to
dispose of Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement pursuant to
an Underwritten Offering and reasonably expects gross proceeds of at least
$100 million from such Underwritten Offering (including proceeds attributable
to any Registrable Securities included in such Underwritten Offering by any
Shelf Piggybacking Holders), the Company shall, at the request (a " _Shelf
Underwritten Offering Request_ ") of such Holder or Holders (in such
capacity, a " _Requesting Holder_ "), enter into an underwriting agreement in
a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company
with the underwriter or underwriters selected by the Requesting Holders
holding a majority of the shares of Common Stock expected to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering (and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and
shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing
Underwriter of such Underwritten Offering and/or the Requesting Holders in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and, subject to _Section 2.2(c)_, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included by any Shelf Piggybacking Holder (a " _Shelf Underwritten Offering_
"); _provided, however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to
facilitate or participate (i) in more than two Shelf Underwritten Offerings
that are initiated by a Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.2 _during any
12-month period (and no more than one Shelf Underwritten Offering in any
120-day period) or (ii) in any Shelf Underwritten Offering if the Company has
conducted a Shelf Underwritten Offering in the preceding 120-day period
in which such Requesting Holder was eligible to exercise piggyback
registration rights pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and was not subject to cutback
pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ to the number of Registrable Securities that the
Requesting Holder had requested be included in the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(b)  If the Company receives a Shelf Underwritten Offering
Request, it will give written notice of such proposed Shelf
Underwritten Offering to each Holder (other than the Requesting Holder),
which notice shall include the anticipated filing date of the
related Underwritten Offering Filing and, if known, the number of shares of
Common Stock that are proposed to be included in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering, and of such Holders' rights under this _Section 2.2(b)_. Such
notice shall be given promptly (and in any event not later than two Business
Day following receipt of the Shelf Underwritten Offering Request); _provided_
, that if the Shelf Underwritten Offering is a bought or overnight
Underwritten Offering and the Managing Underwriter advises the Company and
the Requesting Holder that the giving of notice pursuant to this _Section
2.2(b)_ would adversely affect the offering, no such notice shall be required
(and such Holders shall have no right to include Registrable Securities in
such bought or overnight Underwritten Offering); and _provided further_ ,
that the Company shall not so notify any such other Holder that has notified
the Company (and not revoked such notice) requesting that such Holder not
receive notice from the Company of any proposed Shelf Underwritten Offering.
If such notice is delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_, each such
Holder shall then have three Business Days (or one Business Day in the case
of a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering) after the date on which the
Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_ to request
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Shelf Underwritten Offering (which
request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such other information as is
reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such Registrable Securities)
(any such Holder making such request, a " _Shelf Piggybacking Holder_ "). If
no request for inclusion from a Holder is received within such period, such
Holder shall have no further right to participate in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering.

  



  

(c)  If the Managing Underwriter of the Shelf Underwritten
Offering shall inform the Requesting Holder of its belief that the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering by the Holders (and any other shares of Common Stock requested to be
included by any other Persons having registration rights with respect to such
offering) would materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company
shall include in the applicable Underwritten Offering Filing, to the extent
of the total number of Registrable Securities that the Company is so advised
can be sold in such Shelf Underwritten Offering without so materially
adversely affecting such offering (the " _Section 2.2 Maximum Number of
Shares_"), Registrable Securities in the following priority:

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(i)   First, all Registrable Securities that the Holders
requested to be included therein (the " _Holders Securities_ ") ( _pro rata_
among the Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities each requested
to be included), and

  



  

(ii)  Second, to the extent that the number of Holders Securities
is less than the _Section 2.2_ Maximum Number of Shares, the shares of
Common Stock requested to be included by any other Persons having registration
rights with respect to such offering,  _pro rata_ among such other Persons
based on the number of shares of Common Stock each requested to be included.

  



  

(d)  The Requesting Holders shall determine the pricing of the
Registrable Securities offered pursuant to any Shelf Underwritten Offering
and the applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and determine the
timing of any such Shelf Underwritten Offering, subject to _Section 2.3_.

  



  

(e)  Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw their
Registrable Securities from the Shelf Underwritten Offering at any time prior
to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto by giving
written notice to the Company of its request to withdraw.

  



  

Section 2.3   _Delay and Suspension Rights_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Company may (i) delay effecting a
Shelf Underwritten Offering or (ii) suspend the Holders' use of any prospectus
that is a part of a Shelf Registration Statement upon written notice to each
Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in such Shelf
Registration Statement (provided that in no event shall such notice contain
any material non-public information regarding the Company) (in which event
such Holder shall discontinue sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement but may settle any then-contracted sales of
Registrable Securities), in each case for a period of up to 40 consecutive
days, if the Board determines (A) that such delay or suspension is in the
best interest of the Company and its stockholders generally due to a pending
financing or other transaction involving the Company, (B) that such
registration or offering would render the Company unable to comply with
applicable securities laws or (C) that such registration or offering would
require disclosure of material information that the Company has a _bona fide_
business purpose for preserving as confidential (any such period, a "
_Suspension Period_ "); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any
Suspension Periods collectively exceed an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day
period or exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 12-month period; _provided,
further_ , that the number of days that the Company may so delay or suspend
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ in the 180-day period and
12-month period immediately following the Closing Date shall be reduced by
the number of days after the Required Shelf Filing Date that the Shelf
Registration Statement is declared or otherwise becomes effective.

  



  

Section 2.4   _Piggyback Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4(c)_, if the Company at any time
proposes to file an Underwritten Offering Filing for an Underwritten Offering
of shares of Common Stock for its own account or for the account of any other
Persons who have or have been granted registration rights, other than the
Holders (a " _Piggyback Underwritten Offering_ "), it will give written
notice of such Piggyback Underwritten Offering to each Holder, which notice
shall include the anticipated filing date of the Underwritten Offering Filing
and, if known, the number of shares of Common Stock that are proposed to be
included in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, and of such Holders' rights
under this _Section 2.4(a)_. Such notice shall be given promptly (and in any
event at least five Business Days before the filing of the Underwritten
Offering Filing or two Business Days before the filing of the
Underwritten Offering Filing in connection with a bought or overnight
Underwritten Offering). If such notice is delivered to pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(a)_, each such Holder shall then have four Business Days (or one
Business Day in the case of a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering)
after the date on which the Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section
2.4(a)_ to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Piggyback
Underwritten Offering (which request shall specify the maximum number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such
other information as is reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such
Registrable Securities) (any such Holder making such request, a "
_Piggybacking Holder_ "). If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within such period, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering. Subject to _Section
2.4(c)_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include
in the Piggyback Underwritten Offering all Registrable Securities that the
Company has been so requested to include by the Piggybacking Holders;
_provided, however_ , that if, at any time after giving written notice of a
proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_
and prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto,
the Company or such other Persons who have or have been granted registration
rights, as applicable, shall determine for any reason not to proceed with or
to delay such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, the Company shall give written
notice of such determination to the Piggybacking Holders and (i) in the case
of a determination not to proceed, shall be relieved of its obligation to
include any Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering
(but not from any obligation of the Company to pay the Registration Expenses
in connection therewith), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay,
shall be permitted to delay inclusion of any Registrable Securities for the
same period as the delay in including the shares of Common Stock to be
sold for the Company's account or for the account of such other Persons who
have or have been granted registration rights, as applicable.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b)  Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request
for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any Piggyback
Underwritten Offering at any time prior to the execution of an underwriting
agreement with respect thereto by giving written notice to the Company of its
request to withdraw. Any Holder may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-Out
Notice_ ") to the Company requesting that such Holder not receive notice from
the Company of any proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering;  _provided,
however_ , that such Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in
writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless
subsequently revoked), the Company shall not, and shall not be required to,
deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and such
Holder shall no longer be entitled to participate in any
Piggyback Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(c) If the Managing Underwriter of the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering shall inform the Company of its belief that the number
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock
proposed to be offered by the Company or such other Persons who have or have
been granted registration rights (and any other shares of Common Stock
requested to be included by any other Persons having registration rights on
parity with the Piggybacking Holders with respect to such offering), would
materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company shall include in
such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, to the extent of the total number of
securities which the Company is so advised can be sold in such offering
without so materially adversely affecting such offering, shares of Common
Stock in the following priority:

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(i)  if the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account
of the Company, first, all shares of Common Stock that the Company proposes
to include for its own account (the " _Company Securities_ "), second, the
shares of Common Stock that the Piggybacking Holders propose to include ( _pro
rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders based on the number of shares of Common
Stock each requested to be included), and third, the shares of Common Stock
that other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights propose
to include ( _pro rata_ among such other Persons based on the number of
shares of Common Stock each requested to be included);

  



  

(ii)  if the notice of a Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)_ is given on or prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Felix Closing Date, the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account
of any other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights,
first, all shares of Common Stock that the Piggybacking Holders propose to
include ( _pro rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders based on the number of
shares of Common Stock each requested to be included), second, the shares of
Common Stock that such other Persons propose to include ( _pro rata_ among
such other Persons based on the number of shares of Common Stock each
requested to be included), and third, the Company Securities; or

  



  

(iii)  if the notice of a Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)_ is given after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Felix
Closing Date, the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account of any
other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights, first, the
shares of Common Stock that such other Persons propose to include ( _pro rata_
 among such other Persons based on the number of shares of Common Stock each
requested to be included), second, all shares of Common Stock that the
Piggybacking Holders propose to include ( _pro rata_ among the Piggybacking
Holders based on the number of shares of Common Stock each requested to be
included), and third, the Company Securities.

  



  

Section 2.5   _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.

  



  

(a)  In connection with any Underwritten Offering contemplated
by _Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.4_, the underwriting agreement into which
each Selling Holder and the Company shall enter into shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to _Article III_) and other
rights and obligations as are customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to designate
counsel for the underwriters. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such Selling Holder's authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and
to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf,
its intended method of distribution and any other representation required
by law.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b)   Any participation by the Piggybacking Holders in a
Piggyback Underwritten Offering shall be in accordance with the plan of
distribution of the Company or the other Persons who have registration rights,
as applicable.

  



  

(c)  In connection with any Piggyback Underwritten Offering in
which any Piggybacking Holder includes Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, such Piggybacking Holder agrees (A) to supply any information
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of a
Registration Statement and/or any other documents relating to such
registered offering and (B) to execute and deliver any agreements and
instruments being executed by all holders on substantially the same terms
reasonably requested by the Company or the Managing Underwriter, as
applicable, to effectuate such registered offering, including, without
limitation, underwriting agreements (subject to _Section 2.5(a)_), custody
agreements, powers of attorney, questionnaires, and lock-ups or "hold back"
agreements pursuant to which such Piggybacking Holder agrees with the
Managing Underwriter not to sell or purchase any securities of the Company
for the shorter of (i) the same period of time following the registered
offering as is agreed to by the Company and the other participating holders
(not to exceed the shortest number of days that any director of the Company,
"executive officer" (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of the
Company or any stockholder of the Company (other than a Holder or director or
employee of, or consultant to, the Company) who owns 10% or more of the
outstanding shares contractually agrees with the underwriters of such
Piggyback Underwritten Offering not to sell any securities of the Company
following such Piggyback Underwritten Offering) and (ii) 60 days from the date
of the execution of the underwriting agreement with respect to such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Section 2.6   _Registration Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  In connection with its obligations under this _Article
II_, the Company will take all reasonably necessary action to facilitate and
effect the transactions contemplated thereby, including, but not limited to,
the following:

  



  

(i)  promptly prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the

such Registration Statement until such time as all of such securities have
been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Selling Holder or Selling Holder thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement;

  



  

(ii)  furnish to each Selling Holder, without charge, such number
of conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each such amendment

Securities Act, and such other documents, as such Selling Holder may
reasonably request;

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(iii)   if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
register or qualify all Registrable Securities and other securities covered
by such Registration Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of
such jurisdictions as each Selling Holder thereof shall reasonably request,
to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such
Registration Statement remains in effect, and to take any other action which
may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Selling Holder
to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned
by such Selling Holder, except that the Company shall not for any such
purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements
of this clause (iii) be obligated to be so qualified or to consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

  



  

(iv)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each

(v)  promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of
which, the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, and at the request of any such Selling Holder promptly
prepare and file or furnish to such Selling Holder a reasonable number of
copies of a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any
other required document as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made;

  



  

(vi)  otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations
of the Commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as
reasonably practicable, an earnings statement, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and shall
furnish to each such Selling Holder at least the Business Day prior to the
filing thereof a copy of any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement or prospectus;

  



  

(vii)  provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement from and after a date not later than the effective
date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

(viii) in connection with the preparation and filing of any
Registration Statement or any sale of Registrable Securities in
connection therewith, the Company will give the Holders offering and selling
thereunder, any underwriters and their respective counsels the opportunity to
review and provide comments on such Registration Statement, each prospectus
included therein or filed with the Commission, and each amendment thereof or
supplement thereto (other than amendments or supplements that do not make
any material change in the information related to the Company) (provided that
the Company shall not file any such Registration Statement including
Registrable Securities or an amendment thereto or any related prospectus or
any supplement thereto to which such Holders or any underwriter shall
reasonably object in writing), and give each of them, together with
any underwriter, broker, dealer or sales agent involved therewith, such
access to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries with its officers, its counsel,
the independent public accountants who have certified its financial
statements, and the independent petroleum engineers of the Company as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of the Holder's and such underwriters' (or
broker's, dealer's or sales agent's, as the case may be) respective counsel,
to conduct a reasonable due diligence investigation within the meaning of the
Securities Act;

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(ix)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and, if any such order suspending the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement is issued, shall promptly use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest
possible moment;

  



  

(x)  promptly notify the Holders (i) of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or the initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose,
(ii) of any delisting or pending delisting of the Common Stock by any
national securities exchange or market on which the Common Stock are then

the Managing Underwriter(s), the Company's directors and "executive officers"
(as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act)) that extend through 60
days following the entrance into the corresponding underwriting
agreement, and to take such other actions as the Holder or Holders shall
reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities; and

  



  

(xiii)  cause its officers to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to support the marketing of the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement (including, without limitation, participation in
electronic or telephonic "road shows").

  



  

(b) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities that upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.6(a)(v)_, such
Holder will forthwith discontinue such Holder's disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until such Holder's
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by _Section 2.6(a)(v)_ as filed with the Commission or until it is advised
in writing by the Company that the use of such Registration Statement may be
resumed, and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company (at
the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in
such Holder's possession of the prospectus relating to such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company may
provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this _Section
2.6(b)_.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Section 2.7   _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no
obligation to include Registrable Securities of a Holder in any Registration
Statement or Underwritten Offering if such Holder has failed to timely furnish
such information as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably request in

Securities that the Company determines, after consultation with its counsel,
is reasonably required in order for any registration statement or prospectus
supplement, as applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.

  



  

Section 2.8   _Expenses_. The Company shall be responsible for all
Registration Expenses incident to its performance of or compliance with its
obligations under this _Article II_. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro
rata share of all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its

Article III

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company will
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its officers and directors and each
Person (if any) that controls such Holder within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including
costs of preparation and attorneys' fees and any legal or other fees or
expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any investigation
or Proceeding), expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, charges and amounts
paid in settlement (" _Losses_ ") as incurred, caused by, arising out of or
based upon, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities (as amended or
supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, any filing made in connection with
the qualifications of the offering under the securities or other blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered, or any
other offering document (including any related notification, or the like)
incident to any such registration, qualification, or compliance, or based on
any or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made), or any violation by the Company of this
Agreement, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any rule or
regulation thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such registration,
qualification, or compliance, _provided, however_ , that such indemnity shall
not apply to that portion of such Losses caused by, or arising out of, any
untrue statement, or alleged untrue statement or any such omission or
alleged omission, to the extent such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use therein.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

Section 3.2   _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each Holder agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors and
each Person (if any) that controls the Company within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made), only to the
extent such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Holder
expressly for use therein.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. In case any Proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 3.1_
or _Section 3.2_, such Person (the  " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly
notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article III_, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure to give notice), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such Proceeding and, unless in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party may exist in respect of such claim,
to assume the defense thereof jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to the extent that it chooses, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party that it so chooses, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Indemnifying Party
fails to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, (ii) if such Indemnified Party who is a defendant in
any action or Proceeding that is also brought against the Indemnifying Party
reasonably shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are not available to the
Indemnifying Party or (iii) if representation of both parties by the same
counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct then, in any such case, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in each jurisdiction, except
to the extent any Indemnified Party or Parties reasonably shall have
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to such party or parties
that are not available to the other Indemnified Parties or to the extent
representation of all Indemnified Parties by the same counsel is
otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct)
and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any expenses therefor. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such
action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action or claim and (B) does not include a statement as to, or an
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

Section 3.4   _Contribution_.

  



  

(a)  If the indemnification provided for in this _Article III_
is unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses in respect of
which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then each Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall to the fullest extent
permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company (on the one hand)
and a Holder (on the other hand) shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

  



  

(b)  The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Article III _were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_. The
amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Article III_, no Holder shall be liable for
indemnification or contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ for any
amount in excess of the net proceeds of the offering received by such Holder,
less the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

Section 4.1   _Rule 144_.

   



  

(a)   With a view to making available the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the resale of the
Registrable Securities without registration, the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to:

  



  

(i)  make and keep public information regarding the Company

the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act and (ii) unless otherwise available via the
Commission's EDGAR filing system, to such Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such
Holder to sell any such securities without registration.

  



  

 _Section 4.2_   _Assistance with Transfers_ Section 4.3. In
connection with any sale or transfer of Registrable Securities by any Holder,
including any sale or transfer pursuant to Rule 144 and other rules and
regulations of the Commission that may at any time permit a Holder of
Registrable Securities to sell securities of the Company to the public without
registration, the Company shall, to the extent allowed by law, take any and
all action necessary or reasonably requested by such Holder in order to
permit or facilitate such sale or transfer, including, without limitation, at
the sole expense of the Company, by (i) issuing such directions to any
transfer agent, registrar or depositary, as applicable, (ii) delivering such
opinions to the transfer agent, registrar or depositary as are customary for
the transaction of this type and are reasonably requested by the same,
and (iii) taking or causing to be taken such other actions as are reasonably
necessary (in each case on a timely basis) in order to cause any legends,
notations or similar designations restricting transferability of the
Registrable Securities held by such Holder to be removed and to rescind any
transfer restrictions with respect to such Registrable Securities; _provided,
however_ , that such Holder shall deliver to the Company, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, representation
letters regarding such Holder\'s compliance with such rules and regulations,
as may be applicable. In addition, the Company, at its sole expense, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove any restrictive legend on any
shares of Common Stock that are Registrable Securities upon request by the
Holder if (A) such shares of Common Stock are sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement or (B) a registration statement covering the resale of
such shares of Common Stock is effective under the Securities Act and the
applicable Holder delivers to the Company a representation letter agreeing
that such shares of Common Stock will be sold under such effective
registration statement.

Article V

  



  

 _TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS_

  



  

The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities under

Transferee is (i) a Permitted Transferee or (ii) acquiring at least $100
million of Registrable Securities as determined by reference to the volume
weighted average price for such Registrable Securities on any securities
exchange or market on which the Common Stock are then listed or quoted for
the five trading days immediately preceding the applicable determination date
(the " _5-Day VWAP_ ") and such Transferee has delivered to the Company a

_Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_ may only be transferred if such Transferee
is (i) an Affiliate of the Investor; or (ii) is acquiring at least $100

Article VI

  



  

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement, each
Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law

specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees
that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses
incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement and further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific
performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

by reason of any stock dividend, split, reverse split, combination,

 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

  



  

2.1   _Location_. All meetings of stockholders for the election
of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and place,
within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated from time to
time by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting. The Board may, in
its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of the stockholders shall not be
held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication in the manner authorized by Section 211 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

  



  

2.2   _Annual Meeting_. The stockholders shall hold an annual
meeting for the election of directors and the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting. The meeting shall be held at
such date, time, and place, if any, as shall be determined by the Board and

2.3   _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law or by
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, Special Meetings of
Stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by either (i) the
chairman of the Board, if there be one, or (ii) the president, (iii) any vice
president, if there be one, (iv) the secretary or (v) any assistant secretary,
if there be one, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in

designated by the Board and whose powers and authority include the power to
call such meetings or (iii) stockholders owning a majority of the capital
stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the
matter for which such Special Meeting of Stockholders is called. Such request
shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. At a Special
Meeting of Stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto).

  



  

2.4   _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting, in the
form of a writing or electronic transmission, shall be given which shall state
the place, if any, date, time, the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such meeting, the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to notice of such meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by law,
notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than

stockholders to reconvene or convene, respectively at the same or some other
place. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned or postponed meeting if
the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications,
if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be
present in person and vote at such adjourned or postponed meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken or, with respect
to a postponed meeting, are publicly announced. At the adjourned or postponed
meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment or postponement is for
more than thirty (30) days, notice of the adjourned or postponed meeting in
accordance with the requirements of _Section 2.4_ shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If, after the
adjournment or postponement, a new record date for stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned or postponed meeting, the Board shall fix a
new record date for notice of such adjourned or postponed meeting in
accordance with _Section 2.10_ hereof, and shall give notice of the
adjourned or postponed meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote
at such adjourned or postponed meeting as of the record date fixed for notice
of such adjourned or postponed meeting.

  



  

2.6   _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by the DGCL or other
applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority
of the shares of stock entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the
stockholders. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the
withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such
quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders,
the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the
manner provided in _Section 2.5_ hereof, until a quorum shall be present or

2.7   _Voting_. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any question brought before any meeting of
the stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the
Corporation's capital stock present at the meeting in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a
single class. Each stockholder shall at every meeting of stockholders be
entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock having voting power held.
Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in this _Section
2.7_. The Board, in its discretion, or the chairman of a meeting of the
stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at
such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

  



  

2.8   _List of Stockholders_. The Corporation shall prepare, at
least ten (10) days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list
of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ ,
if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less
than ten (10) days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting
date. Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, and show the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder; _provided_ , that the Corporation shall not be required
to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information
on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder
for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days
prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
provided that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event
that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic
network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such
information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder
who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the inspection of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting.

  



  

2.9 _Action by Written Consent of Stockholders_. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required
or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the
holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes
which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings
of the stockholders are recorded. The secretary shall give prompt notice of
the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. No written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless
written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are
delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by this _Section 2.9_
within sixty (60) days of the first date on which a written consent is
so delivered to the Corporation. Any person executing a consent may provide,
whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that such a consent
will be effective at a future time (including a time determined upon the
happening of an event), no later than sixty (60) days after such instruction
is given or such provision is made, if evidence of such instruction or
provision is provided to the Corporation. Unless otherwise provided, any such
consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective. An electronic
transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
stockholder or proxy holder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for
a stockholder or proxy holder, shall be deemed to be written and signed for
the purposes of this _Section 2.9_, provided that any such electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
Corporation can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted
by the stockholder or proxy holder or by a person or persons authorized to
act for the stockholder or proxy holder and (ii) the date on which such
stockholder or proxy holder or authorized person or persons transmitted such
electronic transmission. A consent given by electronic transmission shall be
deemed delivered to the Corporation upon the earliest of: (i) when
the consent enters an information processing system, if any, designated by
the Corporation for receiving consents, so long as the electronic
transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and the
Corporation is able to retrieve that electronic transmission; (ii) when a
paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Corporation's
principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are
recorded; (iii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the
Corporation's registered office by hand or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested; or (iv) when delivered in such other manner, if
any, provided by resolution of the Board. Any copy, facsimile or other
reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in
lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original
writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation as provided above in this _Section 2.9_.

2.10 _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of the stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60)
nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so
fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at
the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date
of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no
record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix, as the record date for stockholders entitled
to notice of such adjourned meeting, the same or an earlier date as that
fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.10_.

these Bylaws.

  



  

3.2   _Number, Qualifications, Term_. The number of directors
which shall constitute the entire Board shall be determined from time to time

Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies on the Board resulting from the
death, resignation or removal of a director, or from an increase in the number
of directors constituting the Board, may be filled by the affirmative votes
of a majority of the remaining members of the Board, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A director so elected shall be
elected to hold office until the earlier of the expiration of the term of
office of the director whom he or she has replaced, a successor is duly
elected and qualified, or the earlier of such director's death, resignation,
or removal.

  



  

3.4   _Meetings_. The Board and any committee thereof may hold
meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board or any committee thereof may be held
without call or notice at such place and at such time as may be determined
from time to time by the Board or such committee, respectively. Special
meetings of the Board may be called by the chairman of the Board, if there be
one, the president, or by any director. Special meetings of any committee of
the Board may be called by the chairman of such committee, if there be one,
the president, or any director serving on such committee. Notice of any
special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given
to each director (or, in the case of a committee, to each member of such
committee) not less than twenty-four (24) hours before the date of the
meeting, by telephone, or in the form of a writing or electronic

3.5 _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, at all meetings of the Board, a majority of
the total number of directors, excluding any vacancies, shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board. If at any
meeting a quorum is not present, a majority of the directors present may
adjourn the meeting periodically without notice other than announcement at
the meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum is
present. The act of a majority of directors present in person at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board.

  



  

3.6   _Presence at Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board, or any
committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the Board or such committee
by means of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ shall constitute
presence in person at the meeting.

  



  

3.7   _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or any Board committee may
be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as
applicable, consent in writing and the written consent is filed with the
minutes of the proceedings of the Board or the committee. Any person, whether
or not then a director, may provide, through instruction to an agent or
otherwise, that a consent to action will be effective at a future time
(including a time determined upon the happening of an event) no later than
sixty (60) days after such instruction is given or such provision is made and
such consent shall be deemed to have been given at such effective time so
long as such person is then a director and did not revoke the consent prior to
such time. Any such consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming
effective.

  



  

3.8   _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses,
if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board and may be paid a fixed
sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board or a stated salary for service
as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members
of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for
service as committee members.

  



  

3.9 _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between
the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for
this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof which
authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any such director's
or officer's vote is counted for such purpose if: (i) the material facts as
to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the
committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract
or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(ii) the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee which
authorizes such contract or transaction.

Article VII

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES_

  



  

7.1   _Right to Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  Each person (hereinafter referred to as an "indemnitee") who
was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is
otherwise involved in, any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute
mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or
any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, including any and all
appeals, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she (i) is or
was an employee providing service to an employee benefit plan in which the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates participates or is a
participating company or (ii) is or was a director or an officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director or officer (including elected or appointed positions that are
equivalent to director or officer) of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer (or
equivalent) or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer
(or equivalent), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, Employment Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as provided in _Section 7.3_ with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board.

  



  

(b) To receive indemnification under this _Section 7.1_, an
indemnitee shall submit a written request to the secretary of the
Corporation. Such request shall include documentation or information that is
necessary to determine the entitlement of the indemnitee to indemnification
and that is reasonably available to the indemnitee. Upon receipt by the
secretary of the Corporation of such a written request, the entitlement of
the indemnitee to indemnification shall be determined by the following person
or persons who shall be empowered to make such determination: (i) the Board by
a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such proceeding,
whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum, (ii) a committee of
such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, whether or
not such majority constitutes a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors,
or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee,
(iv) the stockholders of the Corporation or (v) in the event that a change
of control (as defined below) has occurred, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the
indemnitee. The determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made
and, unless a contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be
paid in full by the Corporation not later than 60 days after receipt by the
secretary of the Corporation of a written request for indemnification. For
purposes of this _Section 7.1(b)_, a "change of control" will be deemed to
have occurred if the individuals who, as of the effective date of
these Bylaws, constitute the Board (the " _incumbent board_ ") cease for any
reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; _provided_ , _however_
, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to such effective date
whose election, or nomination for election by the stockholders of the
Corporation, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
then comprising the incumbent board shall be considered as though such
individual were a member of the incumbent board, but excluding, for this
purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the
election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation
of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.

7.2   _Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a)  In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in
_Section 7.1_, each director and each Section 16 officer, as determined by
the chief executive officer of the Corporation in accordance with Section
16a1-f of the Exchange Act (hereinafter referred to as a " _Section 16
officer_ ") shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition
(hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if
the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his
or her capacity as a director or any such officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including,
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication")
that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses
under this _Section 7.2(a)_ or otherwise.

  



  

(b) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in
_Section 7.1_ and except for the Section 16 officers covered under _Section
7.2(a)_ above, any other officer entitled to indemnification in _Section 7.1_
shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the right to be
paid by the Corporation an advancement of expenses, provided, however, that
(i) if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee
in his or her capacity as an officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final adjudication that such
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
_Section 7.2(b)_ or otherwise, and (ii) unless otherwise available pursuant
to _Section 7.4_, the Corporation shall not advance or continue to advance
expenses to any officer covered under this _Section 7.2(b)_ in any
proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (x) by the
Board by a majority vote of directors who are not party to the proceeding with
respect to which an advancement of expenses is sought, even though less than
a quorum, (y) by a majority vote of a committee of such directors designated
by a majority vote of such directors, or (z) if there are no such directors or
such directors so direct, or in the event of a change of control (as defined
in _Section 7.1(b)_), by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such
determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such officer
acted in bad faith or in a manner that such officer did not believe to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. In no event shall
any advance be made in instances where the Board, a committee or
independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such officer
deliberately breached such officer's duty to the Corporation or its
stockholders.

(c)  To receive an advancement of expenses under this _Section
7.2_, an indemnitee shall submit a written request to the secretary of the
Corporation. Such request shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by
the indemnitee and shall include or be accompanied by the undertaking
required by _Section 7.2(a)_. Each such advancement of expenses shall be made
within 20 days after the receipt by the secretary of the Corporation of a
written request for advancement of expenses, subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, as
applicable.

  



  

7.3 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. In the event that a
determination is made that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
or if payment is not timely made following a determination of entitlement to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.1(b) _or if an advancement of
expenses is not timely made under _Section 7.2(c)_, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of
conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Further, in any
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to
recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not
met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are
not parties to such proceeding, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such proceeding that indemnification of the indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such proceeding, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this _Article
VII_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

7.4   _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification
and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this _Article VII_ shall not
be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws or otherwise.

  



  

7.5   _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

7.6   _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation_. Except for those indemnitees entitled to indemnification under
_Section 7.1_, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this  _Article VII_ with respect to the indemnification
and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

7.7   _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees
in this _Article VII_ shall be contract rights. Such rights shall vest at
the time an indemnitee becomes a director or officer of the Corporation and
shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and
administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this _Article VII_
that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be
prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect
to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

  



  

7.8   _Settlement of Claims_. The Corporation shall not be liable
to indemnify any indemnitee under this _Article VII_ for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the Corporation's written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any
judicial award if the Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely
opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.

  



  

7.9   _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this _Article
VII_, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to
all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

7.10 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
VII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VII_ (including, without limitation, all
portions of any paragraph of this _Article VII_ containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not by
themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the
provisions of this _Article VII _(including, without limitation, all
portions of any paragraph of this _Article VII_ containing any such provision
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to
the intent of the parties that the Corporation provide protection to the
indemnitee to the fullest enforceable extent.

  



  

Article VIII

  



  

 _Notices_

  



  

8.1   _Notices_. Whenever written notice is required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any director,
member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given in writing
directed to such director's, committee member's or stockholder's mailing
address (or by electronic transmission directed to such director's,
committee member's or stockholder's electronic mail address, as applicable)
as it appears on the records of the Corporation and shall be given: (a) if
mailed, when the notice is deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, (b) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice
is received or left at such director's, committee member's or
stockholder's address or (c) if given by electronic mail, when directed to
such director's, committee member's or stockholder's electronic mail address
unless such director, committee member or stockholder has notified the
corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to
receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by the under
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. Without
limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to stockholders, but subject to Section 232(e) of the DGCL, any notice to
stockholders given by the Corporation under applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of
electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is
given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written
notice or electronic transmission to the Corporation. Notice given by
electronic transmission, as described above, shall be deemed given: (i) if
by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by a posting on an
electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of
such separate notice; and (iii) if by any other form of electronic
transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a notice may not be given by an electronic transmission from and
after the time that (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by such
electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation and
(ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary
of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for
the giving of notice, provided, however, the inadvertent failure to discover
such inability shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

8.2 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required, by
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given
to any director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in
writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the
person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any Annual or Special Meeting of
Stockholders or any regular or special meeting of the directors or members of
a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or
any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

Article X

  



  

 _Forum for adjudication of certain disputes]_

  



  

10.1 _Forum for Adjudication of Certain Disputes_. Unless the
Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (an
" _Alternative Forum Consent_ "), the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action
or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting
a claim of breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any current
or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any

the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, stockholder,
employee or agent of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs
doctrine of the State of Delaware; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, in the
event that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum
for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of
Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of
Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff
asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction
over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Any person
or entity purchasing, otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares
of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this _Section 10.1 _of _Article X_. The
existence of any prior Alternative Forum Consent shall not act as a waiver of
the Corporation's ongoing consent right as set forth above in this _Section
10.1_ of _Article X_ with respect to any current or future actions or claims.

  



  

Article XI

  



  

 _Amendments_

repealed, in whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by the

alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the
notice of a meeting of the stockholders or Board, as the case may be, called
for the purpose of acting upon any proposed alteration, amendment, repeal or
adoption of new Bylaws. All such alterations, amendments, repeals or
adoptions of new Bylaws must be approved by either the holders of a majority
of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of
the entire Board then in office. Any amendment to these Bylaws adopted by
stockholders which specifies the votes that shall be necessary for the
election of directors shall not be further amended or repealed by the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICY

  



    

Exhibit D  - 1

 



      



  

![](tm2031871d2_ex2-1img01.jpg)

  



  

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION

  

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES

  



  

(Amended and Restated as of [●])

  



  

The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Devon Energy Corporation (the
"Company") has adopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines
specifically tailored to the needs of the Company. These Guidelines reflect
the Board's commitment to monitor the effectiveness of policy and decision-
making both at the Board and management level, with a view to enhancing
stockholder value and taking into account the interests of the Company's
other stakeholders over the long- term. The Board believes these Guidelines
should be an evolving set of corporate governance principles, subject to
alteration as circumstances warrant in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

Director Qualifications and Board Composition

  



  

The Governance Committee is responsible for proposing qualified candidates to
serve on the Board, and reviews with the Board special director
qualifications, taking into account the composition and skills of the entire
Board.

  



  

 _Independence_ -- A majority of the Board members must qualify as
"independent" Directors in accordance with the listing standards of the New
York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the related disclosure requirements in the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") Regulation S-K, Item 407(a).
All of the members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the
Governance Committee must also be Directors determined by the Board to be
independent according to these standards and any applicable enhanced
standards relating to Board committee membership.

  



  

 _Director Qualifications_ -- The Board believes that individuals nominated
by the Board to serve as a Director should have demonstrated notable
achievements and have the ability to make significant contributions to the
direction of the affairs of the Company and to enhance the ability of the
committees of the Board to fulfill their duties. The Governance Committee has
established director qualifications that will be considered in evaluating
candidates for nomination, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1,
which includes such factors as:

  



   | *| Integrity and Accountability -- Character is the primary
consideration in evaluating any Board member. Directors should demonstrate
high ethical standards and integrity in their personal and professional
dealings and be willing to act on and remain accountable for their boardroom
decisions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| Informed Judgment -- Board members should have the ability to
provide wise, thoughtful counsel on a broad range of issues. Directors should
possess high intelligence and wisdom and apply it in decision-making. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    

     



  

![](tm2031871d2_ex2-1img01.jpg)

  



  

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



   | *| Peer Respect -- The Board functions best when Directors value Board
and team performance over individual performance. Openness to other opinions
and the willingness to listen should rank as highly as the ability to
communicate persuasively. Board members should approach others assertively,
responsibly, and supportively and raise tough questions in a manner that
encourages open discussion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| High Performance Standards -- In today's highly competitive world,
only companies capable of performing at the highest levels are likely to
prosper. Board members should have a history of achievement that reflects
high standards for themselves and others. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

 _Director Recruitment _ -- The Governance Committee shall identify and
recruit candidates to serve on the Board. A list of candidates to be elected
by stockholders shall be presented to the Board for nomination at each annual
meeting of stockholders. Candidates identified to fill vacancies between
meetings of stockholders shall be presented to the Board for appointment. The
Board will take reasonable steps to ensure that a diverse group of qualified
candidates are in the pool from which the Board member nominees are chosen.
The Governance Committee may at its discretion seek third-party resources to
assist in the process and will make the final recommendation to the Board.

  



  

The Governance Committee will consider properly submitted recommendations for
nominees from stockholders and will give appropriate consideration in
the same manner as given to other nominees. Stockholders who wish to submit
director nominees for election may do so by submitting in writing such
nominee's name, in compliance with the procedures required by our Bylaws, to
the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, Attention: Chair of the
Governance Committee, c/o Office of the Corporate Secretary, Devon Energy
Corporation, 333 West Sheridan Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102-5015.
Information on the requirements to ensure that a stockholder's recommendation
is properly and timely submitted can be found in our annual proxy statement.

  



  

 _Director Selection _ -- The Governance Committee shall be responsible for
reviewing with the Board any other special director qualifications, taking
into account the composition and skills of the entire Board. Given the
importance of the Board's role in monitoring the financial performance of the
Company, the Governance Committee shall ensure that a sufficient number of the
Board members are financially literate with ability to read a balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow statement and have an understanding of the
use of financial ratios and other indices for evaluating Company performance.

![](tm2031871d2_ex2-1img01.jpg)

  



  

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



  

An invitation to join the Board shall only be extended to a potential
candidate at such time as the nomination or appointment of the candidate has
been approved by the Board.

  



  

 _Director Resignation Policy_ _-- _Any nominee for Director in an
uncontested election who fails to receive a greater number of votes cast
"for" such nominee's election than the votes cast "withheld" in such nominee's
election shall tender his or her written offer of resignation for
consideration by the Governance Committee within 90 days from the date of the
election. The Governance Committee shall consider all of the relevant facts
and circumstances and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with
respect to such offer of resignation.

  



  

 _Term Limits_   -- The Board does not believe it should establish term
limits. While term limits could help ensure that there are fresh ideas and
viewpoints available to the Board, they have the disadvantage of causing the
Company to lose the contribution of Directors who have been able to develop,
over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company and its operations
and thereby provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. The
Board believes an annual assessment of Board and committee
performance provides each Director an appropriate opportunity to reflect on
the effectiveness of the Board, and to confirm a Director's decision to
continue as a member of the Board.

  



  

 _Mandatory Retirement _ -- Non-management Directors will retire as of the
annual meeting following their 73rd birthday.

  



  

 _Multiple Directorships _ -- The Company recognizes that its Board members
benefit from service on the boards of other companies. While that service is
encouraged, it is critical that Directors have the opportunity to dedicate
sufficient time to serve on the Company's Board. It is recommended that
Directors serve on no more than four public company boards in addition to the
Board.

  



  

Directors are expected to promptly advise the Chair of the Board and the
Chair of the Governance Committee upon accepting any other public, private,
or not-for-profit company directorship or any assignment to the audit
committee or compensation committee of the board of directors of any public,
private, or not-for-profit company of which such Director is a member.

  



  

No Director shall serve as a director, officer, or employee of a competitor
of the Company, without the approval of the Governance Committee.

  



  

Director Responsibilities

  



  

 _Best Judgment_ -- Directors should exercise their business judgment to act
in what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company in
a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties. Directors should regularly
attend meetings of the Board and of all Board committees upon which they
serve, and should review relevant meeting materials in advance of any such
meeting.

![](tm2031871d2_ex2-1img01.jpg)

  



  

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



   

 _Confidentiality _ _-- _Directors shall preserve the confidentiality of
proprietary material given or presented to the Board.

  



  

 _Conflicts of Interest _ -- Directors must disclose to the Audit Committee
any related party transactions and potential conflicts of interest they may
have with respect to any matter under discussion and, if appropriate, refrain
from voting on a matter in which they may have a conflict.

  



  

 _Meeting Attendance_   -- The Chair of the Board will set the schedule and
location for meetings of the Board. The Board will typically hold
regular meetings on a quarterly basis. In addition to the regularly scheduled
meetings, unscheduled Board meetings may be called, upon proper notice, at
any time to address specific needs of the Company. The annual meeting of
stockholders will be scheduled in conjunction with a regularly scheduled
Board meeting. The Board expects all Board members to attend regularly
scheduled Board and committee meetings and the annual meeting of
stockholders, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

  



  

 _Change in Status _ -- Directors are expected to report to the Chair of the
Board and the Chair of the Governance Committee any substantial changes in
his or her principal occupation or professional affiliations or
responsibilities, including retirement, and shall submit his or her offer of
resignation for consideration by the Governance Committee. The Governance
Committee shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and
recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offer of
resignation.

  



  

 _Stock Ownership _ -- The Board believes that members of the Board should
own common stock of the Company to further align their interests and actions
with the interests of the Company's stockholders. The Board has adopted stock
ownership guidelines, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

  



  

Board Committees

  



  

 _Standing Committees_ -- The Board shall at all times maintain, at a
minimum, an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Governance
Committee, and a Reserves Committee, in each case, comprised during the
Governance Period (as defined below) of the number of Directors set forth on
Exhibit 3. Each such committee must operate in accordance with applicable
laws, their respective charters as adopted and amended from time to time by
the Board, the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and the
listing standards of the NYSE. The Board may also establish such other
committees as it deems appropriate and delegate to such committees any
authority permitted by applicable law and the Company's Bylaws as the Board
may see fit.

![](tm2031871d2_ex2-1img01.jpg)

  



  

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



   

Directors' Compensation

  



  

The Governance Committee shall periodically review the form and amounts of
Directors' compensation and make recommendations to the Board with respect
thereto. The Board shall set the form and amounts of Directors' compensation,
taking into account the recommendations of the Governance Committee. The
Board believes that the amount of Directors' compensation should fairly
reflect the contributions of the Directors to the performance of the Company.
The Chair of the Governance Committee shall at least annually obtain a report
on the director compensation policies and practices of the Company's
principal competitors and other comparable companies. Only non-management
Directors shall receive compensation for their services as Director. To
create a direct linkage with corporate performance, the Board believes that a
meaningful portion of the total compensation of non-management Directors
should be provided and held in Company common stock, stock options,
restricted stock awards, or other types of equity-based compensation.

  



  

Leadership Structure

  



  

The Board reserves the right to determine, from time to time, how to
configure the leadership of the Board and the Company in the way that best
serves the Company. Subject, during the Governance Period, to the
requirements in Exhibit 3, the Board specifically reserves the right to vest
the chair and chief executive officer responsibilities in the same
individual. The Board has no fixed policy with respect to combining
or separating the offices of chair and chief executive officer. In the event
one individual holds both positions or if the chair is otherwise not an
independent Director, then the non-management Directors, after consulting with
all members of the Board, shall, from time to time, appoint an independent
Director to serve as the Lead Director.

  



  

Board Procedures

  



  

 _Agenda_ -- The Chair of the Board shall set the agendas for meetings of the
Board and the Chair of each committee shall set the agendas for meetings of
the applicable committee. Any Director may suggest agenda items and may raise
at meetings other matters that they consider worthy of discussion.

  



  

Information and data that is important to the Board's understanding of the
business to be discussed at meetings will be distributed in advance of
meetings to the extent practicable, except when such material is too
sensitive to be put in writing. To prepare for meetings, Directors
should review these materials in advance of each meeting.

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



   

 _Non-Management Director Sessions _ -- Executive sessions or meetings of
non-management Directors without management present shall be held at each
regularly scheduled quarterly meeting. In the event any of the non-management
Directors is not independent, then an executive session including only
independent Directors shall be held at least once a year, and if the Chair is
not independent, the Lead Director shall preside over such meetings.
Additional executive sessions or meetings of non-management Directors may be
held from time to time as required. If the Chair is a member of management,
then the Lead Director shall preside over meetings of non-management
Directors. Executive sessions shall be held from time to time with the Chief
Executive Officer for a general discussion of relevant subjects.

  



  

 _Orientation and Continuing Education_   -- The Board will establish, or
identify and provide access to, appropriate orientation programs, sessions, or
materials for newly elected Directors for their benefit either prior to or
within a reasonable period of time after their election or appointment. The
Board will encourage, but not require, Directors to periodically pursue or
obtain appropriate continuing education programs, sessions, or materials as
to the responsibilities of directors of publicly traded companies.

  



  

 _Access to Management_ -- The Company shall provide each Director with
complete access to the management of the Company, subject to reasonable
advance notice to the Company and reasonable efforts to avoid disruption to
the Company's management, business, and operations.

  



  

 _Independent Advisors_ -- The Board and Board committees, to the extent set
forth in the applicable committee charter, have the right to consult and
retain independent legal and other advisors at the expense of the Company.

  



  

Board Policies

  



  

 _Equity Plans_ -- All Company equity compensation plans, except plans
assumed in connection with mergers or acquisitions, and tax qualified and
excess benefit plans will be approved by stockholders. Unless submitted to
stockholders for approval, stock options will not be repriced.

  



  

 _Code of Conduct_ -- The Company will continuously maintain a Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics setting forth the Company's expectations in
various areas of legal and ethical concern. The Code addresses specific
elements of the Company's business and refers to separate Company policies
that are currently in place.

  



  

Management Evaluation and Succession

  



  

 _Annual Evaluation_ -- The Compensation Committee shall be responsible for
coordinating an annual evaluation and determining the annual compensation of
the President and Chief Executive Officer. The Chair of the Compensation
Committee shall be the liaison with the President and Chief Executive
Officer.

provide an annual report on succession planning and related personnel
development recommendations to the Board or the Compensation Committee,
including a short-term succession plan delineating temporary delegation of
authority in the event that the President and Chief Executive Officer or any
other executive officer is unexpectedly unable to perform his or her duties.

  



  

Annual Performance Evaluation of the Board

  



  

 _Board Evaluation_ -- The Board will conduct an annual evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Board and the Board committees, which shall be
reviewed and discussed by the Governance Committee.

  



  

 _Committee Evaluations_ -- The Governance Committee, the Compensation
Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Reserves Committee will complete
annual performance evaluations in accordance with their respective charters.

  



  

The full Board will discuss the evaluation reports to determine what, if any,
actions could improve the effectiveness and performance of the Board or the
Board committees.

  



  

Reporting of Concerns to Non-Management Directors

  



  

The Company shall establish a method whereby interested parties may
communicate directly with the Chair or Lead Director, as applicable, or with
the non-management Directors of the Board as a group either by email or by
telephone, as set forth under the Corporate Governance section of the
Company's website at www.devonenergy.com. Information provided by email or
telephone will be monitored by the Corporate Secretary's office and forwarded
to the non- management Directors.

  



  

Communication with Stockholders

  



  

Except in unusual circumstances or as required by committee charters or as
requested by senior management, Directors are expected to follow the principle
that senior management, as opposed to individual Directors, shall provide the
public voice of the Company. Directors receiving inquiries from a member of
the public, institutional investors, the press, customers, securities
analysts, stockholders, or others should refer the inquiries to the President
and Chief Executive Officer or another appropriate officer of the Company.

Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



   

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for establishing effective
communications with the Company's stakeholder groups, i.e., stockholders,
customers, Company associates, communities, suppliers, creditors,
governments, and corporate partners. It is the policy of the Company that
management speaks for the Company. This policy does not preclude non-
management Directors from meeting with stockholders, but it is preferable
for any such meetings to be conducted with management present.

  



  

Review of Corporate Governance Guidelines

  



  

The Board, with the assistance of the Governance Committee, as appropriate,
shall review these Corporate Governance Guidelines from time to time to
determinate whether any changes are appropriate. Consistent with NYSE listing
requirements these Guidelines will be included on the Company's website.

  



  

During the Governance Period, these Guidelines may be amended, modified, or
waived by the affirmative vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Directors.
Following the Governance Period, these Guidelines may be amended, modified,
or waived by the Board, and waivers of these Guidelines may also be
granted by the Governance Committee. Any amendments, modifications and
waivers shall also be subject to the disclosure requirements and other
provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Certain Additional Requirements

  



  

In connection with the closing of the merger (the "Merger") under the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 26, 2020 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among the Company, [Merger Sub] and WPX Energy, Inc.
("WPX"), which the Board has deemed advisable and in the best interest of the
Company and its stockholders, the Board has agreed to adopt certain
requirements of the Board and management which are set forth in this Exhibit
3 and are to be effective from the effective time of the Merger on [●] (the
"Effective Date") and for two years thereafter (the "Governance Period"),
unless otherwise altered in accordance with these Guidelines.

  



   | 1.| _Board Size_. The Board has, as of the effective time of the
Merger, caused the size of the Board to comply with Section 5.18(a) of the
Merger Agreement and designated certain persons to the Board as contemplated
thereby. The persons designated as Directors by the Company pursuant to
Section 5.18(a) of the Merger Agreement and the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger are referred to herein as the "Devon Directors", and the persons
designated as Directors by WPX pursuant to Section 5.18(a) of the Merger
Agreement (including the person (the "EnCap Director") designated pursuant to
the Stockholders Agreement among the Company, Felix Investments II, LLC and
the other parties thereto) and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WPX
as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger are referred to
herein as the "WPX Directors". The Board acknowledges that the EnCap Director
may, from time to time, serve on the board of directors (or similar governing
body) of one or more portfolio companies of EnCap Investments L.P. (or a fund
managed thereby) that competes with the Company, and the Board waives the
limitation on serving as a director of a competitor with respect to the EnCap
Director in respect of any such position with any such portfolio company. If,
for any reason, during the Governance Period, (i) any WPX Director is unable
or unwilling to serve on the Board or any committee, such vacancy shall be
filled by the Board, and the Board shall not nominate or designate any
individual to fill such vacancy, unless, not less than a majority of the
Continuing WPX Directors have approved the appointment or nomination (as
applicable) of the individual appointed or nominated (as applicable) to fill
such vacancy, and (ii) any Devon Director is unable or unwilling to serve on
the Board or any committee, such vacancy shall be filled by the Board, and
the Board shall not nominate or designate any individual to fill such
vacancy, unless, not less than a majority of the Continuing Devon Directors
have approved the appointment or nomination (as applicable) of the individual
appointed or nominated (as applicable) to fill such vacancy. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, (x) the term "Continuing WPX Directors" shall mean,
at any given time, the WPX Directors then serving as Directors and any
Directors who were subsequently appointed or nominated and elected to fill
a vacancy created by the cessation of service of a WPX Director (or any
Continuing WPX Director) pursuant to the preceding sentence, and (y) the term
"Continuing Devon Directors" shall mean, at any given time, the Devon
Directors then serving as Directors and any Directors who were subsequently
appointed or nominated and elected to fill a vacancy created by the cessation
of service of a Devon Director (or any Continuing Devon Director) pursuant to
the preceding sentence. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | Exhibit 3-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



    

   | 2.| _Re-Election_. The Devon Directors and the WPX Directors shall
serve as Directors of the Company during the Governance Period. For the first
and second annual meetings of the Company's stockholders following the
Effective Date (each, an "Applicable Meeting"), except as provided in this
Section 2 of this Exhibit 3, the Governance Committee and the Board shall
nominate, recommend and designate the Devon Directors and the WPX Directors
then on the Board for re-election (the "Recommended Slate"). The Board and
the Governance Committee shall take all action within their power to secure
the election of the Recommended Slate at the Applicable Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Governance Committee, by the
affirmative vote of 75% of the Directors on the Governance Committee,
determines not to nominate any Devon Director or any WPX Director for re-
election at an Applicable Meeting, such Director shall not be nominated,
recommended or designated for re-election, but, for the avoidance of doubt,
the selection of the replacement for such Director shall be subject to the
penultimate sentence of Section 1. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| _Chairman_. Subject to this Section 3 of this Exhibit 3, Dave
Hager shall be appointed the Chair of the Board during the Governance Period,
unless at any time the Board, by the affirmative vote of 75% of the
Board, determines not to appoint Mr. Hager as Chair of the Board. If Mr.
Hager is unable or unwilling to serve at any time (including in circumstances
where he is not re-elected as a Director of the Company or is otherwise
removed from office by a resolution of the Company's stockholders in
accordance with applicable law and the Bylaws) or when Mr. Hager's term as
Chair expires, then a Chair shall be appointed by the Board. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| _Chief Executive Officer_. Subject to this Section 4 of this
Exhibit 3, as set forth in, and subject to, the Employment Agreement, dated
as of the date of the Merger Agreement, between the Company and Richard
E. Muncrief (the "CEO Agreement"), the Board shall designate Mr. Muncrief to
serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company during the Governance
Period, unless at any time the Board, by the affirmative vote of 75% of the
Board, determines to remove Mr. Muncrief as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company and, during such period, the Board shall not and shall cause
the Company not to amend, modify or terminate the CEO Agreement without the
affirmative vote of 75% of the Board. For the avoidance of doubt and in
compliance with the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, Mr. Muncrief shall not be entitled to vote with respect thereto. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | Exhibit 3-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



    

   | 5.| _Governance Committee Membership_. During the Governance Period,
the Board shall take all necessary action to cause the Governance Committee
of the Board to consist of 4 members, 2 of which shall be Devon Directors
and 2 of which shall be WPX Directors. Subject to the penultimate sentence of
Section 1, one of the WPX Directors on the Governance Committee shall be the
EnCap Director. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| _Audit Committee Membership_. During the Governance Period, the
Board shall take all necessary action to cause the Audit Committee of the
Board to consist of 5 members, 3 of which shall be Devon Directors and 2 of
which shall be WPX Directors.

Period, the Board shall take all necessary action to cause the Compensation
Committee of the Board to consist of 5 members, 3 of which shall be Devon
Directors and 2 of which shall be WPX Directors.

the Board to consist of 5 members, 3 of which shall be Devon Directors and 2

registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the resale of the
Registrable Securities from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the

with the Commission in accordance with Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act
(an  " _ASR Filing_ "). If the Shelf Registration Statement does not qualify

cause such Registration Statement to become or be declared effective as soon

after the date of this Agreement in the case of a Shelf Registration
Statement on Form S-3 or 90 days after the date of this Agreement in the case

if Form S-3 is not then available to the Company, on Form S-1 or such other
form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration
for resale of such Registrable Securities and shall contain a prospectus in
such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar rule
adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time beginning on the
effective date for such Registration Statement. The Shelf Registration
Statement shall provide for the distribution or resale pursuant to any method
or combination of methods legally available to the Holders.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended as promptly as practicable to the extent necessary to
ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another Registration Statement is available (which
Registration Statement shall also be referred to herein as the Shelf
Registration Statement), for the resale of all the Registrable Securities
until all of the Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities or the earlier termination of this Agreement (as to all Holders).

  



  

(d)  When effective, the Shelf Registration Statement (including
the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
prospectus contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made).

dispose of Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement pursuant to
an Underwritten Offering and reasonably expects gross proceeds of at least
$100 million from such Underwritten Offering (including proceeds attributable
to any Registrable Securities included in such Underwritten Offering by any
Shelf Piggybacking Holders), the Company shall, at the request (a " _Shelf
Underwritten Offering Request_ ") of such Holder or Holders (in such
capacity, a " _Requesting Holder_ "), enter into an underwriting agreement in
a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company
with the underwriter or underwriters selected by the Requesting Holders
holding a majority of the shares of Common Stock expected to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering (and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and
shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing
Underwriter of such Underwritten Offering and/or the Requesting Holders in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and, subject to _Section 2.2(c)_, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included by any Shelf Piggybacking Holder (a " _Shelf Underwritten Offering_
"); _provided, however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to
facilitate or participate (i) in more than two Shelf Underwritten Offerings
that are initiated by a Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.2 _during any
12-month period (and no more than one Shelf Underwritten Offering in any
120-day period) or (ii) in any Shelf Underwritten Offering if the Company has
conducted a Shelf Underwritten Offering in the preceding 120-day period
in which such Requesting Holder was eligible to exercise piggyback
registration rights pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and was not subject to cutback
pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ to the number of Registrable Securities that the
Requesting Holder had requested be included in the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(b)  If the Company receives a Shelf Underwritten Offering
Request, it will give written notice of such proposed Shelf
Underwritten Offering to each Holder (other than the Requesting Holder),
which notice shall include the anticipated filing date of the
related Underwritten Offering Filing and, if known, the number of shares of
Common Stock that are proposed to be included in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering, and of such Holders' rights under this _Section 2.2(b)_. Such
notice shall be given promptly (and in any event not later than two Business
Day following receipt of the Shelf Underwritten Offering Request); _provided_
, that if the Shelf Underwritten Offering is a bought or overnight
Underwritten Offering and the Managing Underwriter advises the Company and
the Requesting Holder that the giving of notice pursuant to this _Section
2.2(b)_ would adversely affect the offering, no such notice shall be required
(and such Holders shall have no right to include Registrable Securities in
such bought or overnight Underwritten Offering); and _provided further_ ,
that the Company shall not so notify any such other Holder that has notified
the Company (and not revoked such notice) requesting that such Holder not
receive notice from the Company of any proposed Shelf Underwritten Offering.
If such notice is delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_, each such
Holder shall then have three Business Days (or one Business Day in the case
of a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering) after the date on which the
Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_ to request
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Shelf Underwritten Offering (which
request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such other information as is
reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such Registrable Securities)
(any such Holder making such request, a " _Shelf Piggybacking Holder_ "). If
no request for inclusion from a Holder is received within such period, such
Holder shall have no further right to participate in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering.

  



  

(c)  If the Managing Underwriter of the Shelf Underwritten
Offering shall inform the Requesting Holder of its belief that the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering by the Holders (and any other shares of Common Stock requested to be
included by any other Persons having registration rights with respect to such
offering) would materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company
shall include in the applicable Underwritten Offering Filing, to the extent
of the total number of Registrable Securities that the Company is so advised
can be sold in such Shelf Underwritten Offering without so materially
adversely affecting such offering (the " _Section 2.2 Maximum Number of
Shares_"), Registrable Securities in the following priority:

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(i)   First, all Registrable Securities that the Holders
requested to be included therein (the " _Holders Securities_ ") ( _pro rata_
among the Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities each requested
to be included), and

  



  

(ii)  Second, to the extent that the number of Holders Securities
is less than the _Section 2.2_ Maximum Number of Shares, the shares of
Common Stock requested to be included by any other Persons having registration
rights with respect to such offering,  _pro rata_ among such other Persons
based on the number of shares of Common Stock each requested to be included.

  



  

(d)  The Requesting Holders shall determine the pricing of the
Registrable Securities offered pursuant to any Shelf Underwritten Offering
and the applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and determine the
timing of any such Shelf Underwritten Offering, subject to _Section 2.3_.

  



  

(e)  Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw their
Registrable Securities from the Shelf Underwritten Offering at any time prior
to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto by giving
written notice to the Company of its request to withdraw.

  



  

Section 2.3   _Delay and Suspension Rights_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Company may (i) delay effecting a
Shelf Underwritten Offering or (ii) suspend the Holders' use of any prospectus
that is a part of a Shelf Registration Statement upon written notice to each
Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in such Shelf
Registration Statement (provided that in no event shall such notice contain
any material non-public information regarding the Company) (in which event
such Holder shall discontinue sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement but may settle any then-contracted sales of
Registrable Securities), in each case for a period of up to 40 consecutive
days, if the Board determines (A) that such delay or suspension is in the
best interest of the Company and its stockholders generally due to a pending
financing or other transaction involving the Company, (B) that such
registration or offering would render the Company unable to comply with
applicable securities laws or (C) that such registration or offering would
require disclosure of material information that the Company has a _bona fide_
business purpose for preserving as confidential (any such period, a "
_Suspension Period_ "); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any
Suspension Periods collectively exceed an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day
period or exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 12-month period; _provided,
further_ , that the number of days that the Company may so delay or suspend
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ in the 180-day period and
12-month period immediately following the Closing Date shall be reduced by
the number of days after the Required Shelf Filing Date that the Shelf
Registration Statement is declared or otherwise becomes effective.

  



  

Section 2.4   _Piggyback Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4(c)_, if the Company at any time
proposes to file an Underwritten Offering Filing for an Underwritten Offering
of shares of Common Stock for its own account or for the account of any other
Persons who have or have been granted registration rights, other than the
Holders (a " _Piggyback Underwritten Offering_ "), it will give written
notice of such Piggyback Underwritten Offering to each Holder, which notice
shall include the anticipated filing date of the Underwritten Offering Filing
and, if known, the number of shares of Common Stock that are proposed to be
included in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, and of such Holders' rights
under this _Section 2.4(a)_. Such notice shall be given promptly (and in any
event at least five Business Days before the filing of the Underwritten
Offering Filing or two Business Days before the filing of the
Underwritten Offering Filing in connection with a bought or overnight
Underwritten Offering). If such notice is delivered to pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(a)_, each such Holder shall then have four Business Days (or one
Business Day in the case of a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering)
after the date on which the Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section
2.4(a)_ to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Piggyback
Underwritten Offering (which request shall specify the maximum number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such
other information as is reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such
Registrable Securities) (any such Holder making such request, a "
_Piggybacking Holder_ "). If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within such period, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering. Subject to _Section
2.4(c)_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include
in the Piggyback Underwritten Offering all Registrable Securities that the
Company has been so requested to include by the Piggybacking Holders;
_provided, however_ , that if, at any time after giving written notice of a
proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_
and prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto,
the Company or such other Persons who have or have been granted registration
rights, as applicable, shall determine for any reason not to proceed with or
to delay such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, the Company shall give written
notice of such determination to the Piggybacking Holders and (i) in the case
of a determination not to proceed, shall be relieved of its obligation to
include any Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering
(but not from any obligation of the Company to pay the Registration Expenses
in connection therewith), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay,
shall be permitted to delay inclusion of any Registrable Securities for the
same period as the delay in including the shares of Common Stock to be
sold for the Company's account or for the account of such other Persons who
have or have been granted registration rights, as applicable.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b)  Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request
for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any Piggyback
Underwritten Offering at any time prior to the execution of an underwriting
agreement with respect thereto by giving written notice to the Company of its
request to withdraw. Any Holder may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-Out
Notice_ ") to the Company requesting that such Holder not receive notice from
the Company of any proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering;  _provided,
however_ , that such Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in
writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless
subsequently revoked), the Company shall not, and shall not be required to,
deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and such
Holder shall no longer be entitled to participate in any
Piggyback Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(c) If the Managing Underwriter of the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering shall inform the Company of its belief that the number
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock
proposed to be offered by the Company or such other Persons who have or have
been granted registration rights (and any other shares of Common Stock
requested to be included by any other Persons having registration rights on
parity with the Piggybacking Holders with respect to such offering), would
materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company shall include in
such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, to the extent of the total number of
securities which the Company is so advised can be sold in such offering
without so materially adversely affecting such offering, shares of Common
Stock in the following priority:

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(i)  if the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account
of the Company, first, all shares of Common Stock that the Company proposes
to include for its own account (the " _Company Securities_ "), second, the
shares of Common Stock that the Piggybacking Holders propose to include ( _pro
rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders based on the number of shares of Common
Stock each requested to be included), and third, the shares of Common Stock
that other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights propose
to include ( _pro rata_ among such other Persons based on the number of
shares of Common Stock each requested to be included);

  



  

(ii)  if the notice of a Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)_ is given on or prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Felix Closing Date, the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account
of any other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights,
first, all shares of Common Stock that the Piggybacking Holders propose to
include ( _pro rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders based on the number of
shares of Common Stock each requested to be included), second, the shares of
Common Stock that such other Persons propose to include ( _pro rata_ among
such other Persons based on the number of shares of Common Stock each
requested to be included), and third, the Company Securities; or

  



  

(iii)  if the notice of a Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)_ is given after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Felix
Closing Date, the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account of any
other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights, first, the
shares of Common Stock that such other Persons propose to include ( _pro rata_
 among such other Persons based on the number of shares of Common Stock each
requested to be included), second, all shares of Common Stock that the
Piggybacking Holders propose to include ( _pro rata_ among the Piggybacking
Holders based on the number of shares of Common Stock each requested to be
included), and third, the Company Securities.

  



  

Section 2.5   _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.

  



  

(a)  In connection with any Underwritten Offering contemplated
by _Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.4_, the underwriting agreement into which
each Selling Holder and the Company shall enter into shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to _Article III_) and other
rights and obligations as are customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to designate
counsel for the underwriters. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such Selling Holder's authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and
to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf,
its intended method of distribution and any other representation required
by law.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b)   Any participation by the Piggybacking Holders in a
Piggyback Underwritten Offering shall be in accordance with the plan of
distribution of the Company or the other Persons who have registration rights,
as applicable.

  



  

(c)  In connection with any Piggyback Underwritten Offering in
which any Piggybacking Holder includes Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, such Piggybacking Holder agrees (A) to supply any information
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of a
Registration Statement and/or any other documents relating to such
registered offering and (B) to execute and deliver any agreements and
instruments being executed by all holders on substantially the same terms
reasonably requested by the Company or the Managing Underwriter, as
applicable, to effectuate such registered offering, including, without
limitation, underwriting agreements (subject to _Section 2.5(a)_), custody
agreements, powers of attorney, questionnaires, and lock-ups or "hold back"
agreements pursuant to which such Piggybacking Holder agrees with the
Managing Underwriter not to sell or purchase any securities of the Company
for the shorter of (i) the same period of time following the registered
offering as is agreed to by the Company and the other participating holders
(not to exceed the shortest number of days that any director of the Company,
"executive officer" (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of the
Company or any stockholder of the Company (other than a Holder or director or
employee of, or consultant to, the Company) who owns 10% or more of the
outstanding shares contractually agrees with the underwriters of such
Piggyback Underwritten Offering not to sell any securities of the Company
following such Piggyback Underwritten Offering) and (ii) 60 days from the date
of the execution of the underwriting agreement with respect to such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Section 2.6   _Registration Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  In connection with its obligations under this _Article
II_, the Company will take all reasonably necessary action to facilitate and

been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Selling Holder or Selling Holder thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement;

  



  

(ii)  furnish to each Selling Holder, without charge, such number
of conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each such amendment

reasonably request;

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(iii)   if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
register or qualify all Registrable Securities and other securities covered
by such Registration Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of
such jurisdictions as each Selling Holder thereof shall reasonably request,
to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such
Registration Statement remains in effect, and to take any other action which
may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Selling Holder
to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned
by such Selling Holder, except that the Company shall not for any such
purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign

of this clause (iii) be obligated to be so qualified or to consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

  



  

(iv)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each

(v)  promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a

Act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of
which, the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, and at the request of any such Selling Holder promptly
prepare and file or furnish to such Selling Holder a reasonable number of
copies of a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any
other required document as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an

satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and shall
furnish to each such Selling Holder at least the Business Day prior to the
filing thereof a copy of any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement or prospectus;

  



  

(vii)  provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement from and after a date not later than the effective
date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

(viii) in connection with the preparation and filing of any
Registration Statement or any sale of Registrable Securities in
connection therewith, the Company will give the Holders offering and selling
thereunder, any underwriters and their respective counsels the opportunity to
review and provide comments on such Registration Statement, each prospectus
included therein or filed with the Commission, and each amendment thereof or
supplement thereto (other than amendments or supplements that do not make
any material change in the information related to the Company) (provided that
the Company shall not file any such Registration Statement including
Registrable Securities or an amendment thereto or any related prospectus or
any supplement thereto to which such Holders or any underwriter shall
reasonably object in writing), and give each of them, together with
any underwriter, broker, dealer or sales agent involved therewith, such
access to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries with its officers, its counsel,
the independent public accountants who have certified its financial
statements, and the independent petroleum engineers of the Company as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of the Holder's and such underwriters' (or
broker's, dealer's or sales agent's, as the case may be) respective counsel,
to conduct a reasonable due diligence investigation within the meaning of the
Securities Act;

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(ix)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and, if any such order suspending the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement is issued, shall promptly use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest
possible moment;

  



  

(x)  promptly notify the Holders (i) of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or the initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose,
(ii) of any delisting or pending delisting of the Common Stock by any
national securities exchange or market on which the Common Stock are then

(as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act)) that extend through 60
days following the entrance into the corresponding underwriting
agreement, and to take such other actions as the Holder or Holders shall

Registrable Securities; and

  



  

(xiii)  cause its officers to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to support the marketing of the Registrable Securities covered by the

electronic or telephonic "road shows").

  



  

(b) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities that upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.6(a)(v)_, such
Holder will forthwith discontinue such Holder's disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until such Holder's
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by _Section 2.6(a)(v)_ as filed with the Commission or until it is advised
in writing by the Company that the use of such Registration Statement may be
resumed, and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company (at
the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in
such Holder's possession of the prospectus relating to such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company may

2.6(b)_.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Section 2.7   _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no
obligation to include Registrable Securities of a Holder in any Registration
Statement or Underwritten Offering if such Holder has failed to timely furnish
such information as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably request in

Article III

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company will
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its officers and directors and each
Person (if any) that controls such Holder within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including
costs of preparation and attorneys' fees and any legal or other fees or
expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any investigation
or Proceeding), expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, charges and amounts
paid in settlement (" _Losses_ ") as incurred, caused by, arising out of or
based upon, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities (as amended or
supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, any filing made in connection with
the qualifications of the offering under the securities or other blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered, or any
other offering document (including any related notification, or the like)
incident to any such registration, qualification, or compliance, or based on
any or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made), or any violation by the Company of this
Agreement, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any rule or
regulation thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such registration,
qualification, or compliance, _provided, however_ , that such indemnity shall
not apply to that portion of such Losses caused by, or arising out of, any
untrue statement, or alleged untrue statement or any such omission or
alleged omission, to the extent such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use therein.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

Section 3.2   _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each Holder agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors and
each Person (if any) that controls the Company within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made), only to the
extent such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Holder
expressly for use therein.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. In case any Proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 3.1_
or _Section 3.2_, such Person (the  " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly
notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article III_, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure to give notice), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such Proceeding and, unless in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party may exist in respect of such claim,
to assume the defense thereof jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to the extent that it chooses, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party that it so chooses, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Indemnifying Party
fails to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, (ii) if such Indemnified Party who is a defendant in
any action or Proceeding that is also brought against the Indemnifying Party
reasonably shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are not available to the
Indemnifying Party or (iii) if representation of both parties by the same
counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct then, in any such case, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in each jurisdiction, except
to the extent any Indemnified Party or Parties reasonably shall have
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to such party or parties
that are not available to the other Indemnified Parties or to the extent
representation of all Indemnified Parties by the same counsel is
otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct)
and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any expenses therefor. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such
action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action or claim and (B) does not include a statement as to, or an
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

Section 3.4   _Contribution_.

  



  

(a)  If the indemnification provided for in this _Article III_
is unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses in respect of
which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then each Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall to the fullest extent
permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company (on the one hand)
and a Holder (on the other hand) shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

  



  

(b)  The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Article III _were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_. The
amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Article III_, no Holder shall be liable for
indemnification or contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ for any
amount in excess of the net proceeds of the offering received by such Holder,
less the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

Registrable Securities without registration, the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to:

(ii)  file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

  



  

(iii)  so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish
(i) to the extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of
the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act and (ii) unless otherwise available via the
Commission's EDGAR filing system, to such Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such
Holder to sell any such securities without registration.

  



  

 _Section 4.2_   _Assistance with Transfers_ Section 4.3. In
connection with any sale or transfer of Registrable Securities by any Holder,
including any sale or transfer pursuant to Rule 144 and other rules and
regulations of the Commission that may at any time permit a Holder of
Registrable Securities to sell securities of the Company to the public without
registration, the Company shall, to the extent allowed by law, take any and
all action necessary or reasonably requested by such Holder in order to
permit or facilitate such sale or transfer, including, without limitation, at
the sole expense of the Company, by (i) issuing such directions to any
transfer agent, registrar or depositary, as applicable, (ii) delivering such
opinions to the transfer agent, registrar or depositary as are customary for
the transaction of this type and are reasonably requested by the same,
and (iii) taking or causing to be taken such other actions as are reasonably

transfer restrictions with respect to such Registrable Securities; _provided,
however_ , that such Holder shall deliver to the Company, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, representation
letters regarding such Holder\'s compliance with such rules and regulations,
as may be applicable. In addition, the Company, at its sole expense, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove any restrictive legend on any
shares of Common Stock that are Registrable Securities upon request by the
Holder if (A) such shares of Common Stock are sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement or (B) a registration statement covering the resale of
such shares of Common Stock is effective under the Securities Act and the
applicable Holder delivers to the Company a representation letter agreeing
that such shares of Common Stock will be sold under such effective

Article V

  



  

 _TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS_

  



  

The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities under

million of Registrable Securities as determined by reference to the volume
weighted average price for such Registrable Securities on any securities
exchange or market on which the Common Stock are then listed or quoted for
the five trading days immediately preceding the applicable determination date
(the " _5-Day VWAP_ ") and such Transferee has delivered to the Company a
duly executed Adoption Agreement; _provided_ , that a Holder's rights under
_Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_ may only be transferred if such Transferee
is (i) an Affiliate of the Investor; or (ii) is acquiring at least $100
million of Registrable Securities as determined by the 5-Day VWAP.

  



  

Article VI

  



  

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement, each
Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law
and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees
that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses
incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement and further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific
performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER IN ANY MATTER
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

(d)  If at any time the Investor Director is serving on the

Investor Director or otherwise, the Board shall take all Necessary Action
required to fill the vacancy resulting therefrom with such
replacement designated by the Investor as promptly as practicable. In
furtherance thereof, the Company and the Board shall use its reasonable best
efforts, if requested by the Investor on a timely basis, to fill such vacancy
prior to the time the Board next takes action on any other matter.

  



  

Section 3.3   _Compensation; Indemnification_. The Investor
Director shall be entitled to the same expense reimbursement and
advancement, exculpation and indemnification in connection with his or her

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Investor shall not be entitled to designate any Investor Director pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ to the Board if the Board or a committee thereof reasonably
determines that (i) the election of such Investor Director to the Board would
cause the Company to not be in compliance with applicable Law or (ii) such
Investor Director has been involved in any of the events that would be
required to be disclosed in a registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to
Item 401(f)(2)-(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 or is
subject to any order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Entity
prohibiting service as a director of any public company. In any such case
described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Investor shall withdraw the designation of such proposed Investor
Director, and, subject to the requirements of this _Section 3.4(b)_ be
permitted to designate a replacement therefor (which replacement Investor
Director will also be subject to the requirements of this _Section 3.4(b)_).
The Company hereby agrees that the Investor Director listed on _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement would not be prohibited from serving on the Board pursuant
to clause (i) of the first sentence of this _Section 3.4(b)_.

  



  

(c)  Subject to _Section 3.7_, the Board may impose as a
condition to the Investor Director serving on the Board that such Investor
Director agree to, and be subject to, each Subject Policy. For the avoidance
of doubt, no Subject Policy shall modify any of the rights and obligations of
the parties to this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement between the
parties dated as of the date hereof, the Merger Agreement or any other
agreement entered into between the parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Lock-up_. The Investor shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and continuing for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date (the " _Lock-up Period_ "), (a) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell,
grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, give, assign, hypothecate,
pledge, encumber, grant a security interest in, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of (including
through any hedging or other similar transaction) any economic, voting or
other rights in or to the Issued Shares, or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
directly or indirectly, or (b) enter into any swap or other agreement that
transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of the Issued Shares (any such transaction described in clause (a) or (b)
above, a " _Transfer_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 3.5_ shall not apply to (i) Transfers involving in
the aggregate no more than [●]1 shares of Common Stock (as appropriately
adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction), (ii)
Transfers to Permitted Transferees; _provided, however_ , that if such
Permitted Transferee is EnCap or any of its Controlled Affiliates, EnCap or
such Controlled Affiliate must agree in an executed written agreement (a copy
of which will be delivered to the Company) for the benefit of the Company to
be bound by the terms of this _Section 3.5_ prior to such Transfer or
distribution, as applicable, and that any Permitted Transferee that is an
Affiliate of EnCap and does not otherwise qualify as a Permitted Transferee
shall also agree that such Person shall Transfer such shares of Common Stock
back to EnCap if, during the Lock-Up Period, such Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of EnCap, or (iii) any Transfers made in connection with any tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other similar
transaction approved or recommended by the Board or a committee thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, EnCap shall not be entitled to distribute
shares of Common Stock to its limited partners during the Lock-Up Period. In
connection with any Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, the Company agrees to
not take any action that would cause such Transfer to be subject to
requirements imposed by any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or any other anti-takeover statute or
similar statute enacted under applicable Law (" _Takeover Laws_ "), and, at
the request of the Investor, will take all reasonable steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transfer from the
Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to such transaction.

Section 3.6 _Waiver of Corporate Opportunities_. It is hereby
acknowledged that members of the Investor Group participate in, and own and
will own substantial equity interests in other entities (existing and future)
that participate in, the energy industry (" _Portfolio Companies_ ") and
may make investments and enter into advisory service agreements and other
agreements from time to time with those Portfolio Companies. Any individual
who serves as the Investor Director may also serve as an employee, partner,
officer, director, or member of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies
and, at any given time, members of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies
may be in direct or indirect competition with the Company and/or its
subsidiaries. The Company waives, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the
application of the doctrine of corporate opportunity (or any analogous
doctrine) with respect to the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies or the
Investor Director. As a result of such waiver, no member of the Investor
Group or Portfolio Companies, nor the Investor Director, shall have any
obligation to refrain from: (A) engaging in or managing the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
developing or marketing any products or services that compete (directly or
indirectly) with those of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B)
acquiring assets in the same or similar areas of operation and lines of
business of the Company; (C) investing in, owning or disposing of any (public
or private) interest in any Person engaged in the same or similar activities
or lines of business as, or otherwise in competition with, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (including any member of the Investor Group, a "
_Competing Person_ "); (D) developing a business relationship with any
Competing Person; or (E) entering into any agreement to provide any
service(s) to any Competing Person or acting as an officer, director, member,
manager or advisor to, or other principal of, any Competing Person,
regardless (in the case of each of clauses (A) through (E)) of whether such
activities are in direct or indirect competition with the business or
activities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the activities
described in clauses (A) through (D) are referred to herein as  " _Specified
Activities_ "). To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company hereby
renounces (for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries) any interest
or expectancy in, or in being notified of or offered an opportunity to
participate in, any Specified Activity that may be presented to or become
known to any member of the Investor Group or Portfolio Companies or the
Investor Director. Nothing in this _Section 3.6_ shall be construed to limit
or waive any right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any
express written agreement between the Company and/or one or more of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any member of the Investor Group, any
Portfolio Company, or any of their respective employees, partners, officers,
directors or members, on the other hand.

Section 3.7   _Amendment to Organizational Documents_. The Company
shall not amend, or propose to amend, the Organizational Documents in any
manner that is inconsistent with or would nullify or supersede any of the
terms of this Agreement or would prevent any party hereto from complying with
its obligations hereunder unless such proposed amendment is approved by the
Investor.

the Lock-up Period, (b) the Investor and its Permitted Transferees ceasing to

parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations provided

Section 5.8   _Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a)  No provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived

execute a joinder to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Confidentiality_. Each of the Investor and EnCap shall
hold, and cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees, agents, consultants, auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, financing sources and other consultants and advisors ("
_Representatives_ ") to hold, in strict confidence, unless disclosure to a
regulatory authority is necessary in connection with any necessary regulatory
approval, examination or inspection or unless disclosure is required by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirement of law or the
applicable requirements of any regulatory agency or relevant stock exchange
(in which case, other than in connection with a disclosure in connection with
a routine audit or examination by, or document request from, a regulatory or
self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or auditor, the party disclosing such
information shall provide the other party with prior written notice of such
permitted disclosure), all nonpublic records, books, contracts,
instruments, computer data and other data and information (collectively, "
_Information_ ") concerning the Company, East or any of their respective
subsidiaries furnished to it or the Investor Director by or on behalf of the
Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries (except to the extent
that such information can be shown by the party receiving such Information to
have been (a) previously known by such party from other sources; _provided_
 that such source was not known by such party to be bound by a contractual,
legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the other party, (b) in
the public domain through no violation of this _Section 5.10_ by such party
or (c) later lawfully acquired from other sources by the party to which it
was furnished), and no such party shall release or disclose such Information
to any other person, except its Representatives (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Portfolio Company, unless such Portfolio Company enters into a
joinder agreement with the Company), or use such Information other than in
connection with evaluating and taking actions with respect to such Person's
ownership interest in the Company. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
the Investor and EnCap may, in the ordinary course of their
respective businesses, evaluate investments in the energy industry and that
they are actively seeking to invest in energy related projects in a variety
of areas, including the provision of fresh water and disposal of produced
water in connection with oil and gas exploration and development operations.
The Company understands that the Investor, EnCap and the Investor
Director will retain certain mental impressions of Information, which are
indistinguishable from generalized industry knowledge. Accordingly, the
Company agrees that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Investor,
EnCap and the Investor Director are not precluded from pursuing investments
solely because of such retained mental impressions. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement
shall apply to any action taken independently by any Portfolio Company so
long as the Investor or EnCap has not provided such Portfolio Company with any
Information. For purposes of clarification, no such Portfolio Company shall
be deemed to have been provided with Information solely as a result of
the Investor, EnCap, any Investor Director or any Representative (whether
such Person has been provided with or has knowledge of Information) serving
on the board of such Portfolio Company (provided that such board member does
not use Information in connection with the business of such Portfolio
Company).

Kirkland and Ellis LLP

  

609 Main Street, Suite 4500

  

Houston, Texas 77002

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the opinion (the " _Opinion_ ") to be delivered by
Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _Kirkland_ ") in connection with the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of September 26, 2020 by
and among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (" _Central_ "),
East Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Central (" _Merger Sub_ "), and WPX Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _East_ ") (Central, together with Merger Sub and East, the " _Parties_
," and each, a " _Party_ "), regarding certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), you have
requested certain representations, warranties and covenants with respect to
East, Merger Sub and Central. This officer's certificate (the " _Officer 's
Certificate_") is being provided to you in response to that request. All
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning
specified, either directly or by reference, in the Merger Agreement. Except
as otherwise provided, all "Section" references are to the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and all " _Treasury Regulations
Section_ " references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the
Code.

  



  

Recognizing and acknowledging that Kirkland will rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and statements set forth in this Officer's Certificate
in delivering the Tax Opinion, and that the Tax Opinion will be based on an
assumption that all of the representations, warranties, covenants and
statements set forth herein are true, accurate, and complete in all respects
without regard to any qualification for knowledge, belief or otherwise, the
undersigned officer of East (the " _East Officer_ ") hereby represents and
certifies, in his or her capacity as an officer of East and not in his or her
individual capacity, on behalf of East, that, to the extent the following
statements and representations relate to East (and to the extent otherwise
without reason to believe to the contrary), such statements and
representations are true and correct as of the date hereof and will be true
and correct at the Effective Time (as if made as of the Effective Time) and
through the subsequent periods specified herein:

  



   | 1.| The East Officer is familiar with, or has relied on the knowledge
of other East officers that are familiar with, the matters set forth in this
Officer's Certificate, and has made such investigations of factual matters as
the East Officer has deemed reasonably necessary for the purpose of making
the representations, warranties, covenants and statements in this Officers'
Certificate. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

Exhibit G - 1

 



    



   | 2.| The facts, representations, and warranties relating to the Merger,
as described or otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement and the
registration statement on Form S-4 filed publicly by Central with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on [●], as amended or supplemented through
the date hereof (the " _Registration Statement_ "), the proxy
statement/prospectus included as a part of the Registration Statement (the "
_Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and the other documents referred to in the
Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (collectively, the " _Transaction Documents_ "), in each
case, insofar as such facts, representations, and warranties pertain to East,
and its respective affiliates, are true and correct in all material respects
(giving effect to the qualifications in the Disclosure Schedules). The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus does not omit a material fact that would make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, misleading. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)) or by applicable state
or local income or franchise tax law, none of East or any of its affiliates
will take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income or
franchise tax return, or take any other U.S. tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with (i) the Reorganization Treatment or (ii) the
representations, warranties, covenants and statements in this
Officer's Certificate. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| Each of East and the East Subsidiaries that was or will be a party
to the Merger had and will have all requisite corporate powers and authority
to undertake and consummate the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| Each of East and the East Subsidiaries that was or will be a party
to the Merger has complied and will comply with all requirements under the
relevant operating documents and local law to effect the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| The Merger will be consummated in accordance with (i) the material
terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents, and none of the material
terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or modified, and
(ii) the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The facts relating to the Merger as described in the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the documents
referenced therein are true and correct in all material respects. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| East is not (i) a regulated investment company, (ii) a real estate
investment trust, or (iii) a corporation 50 percent or more of the fair
market value of whose total assets are stock and securities and 80 percent or
more of the fair market value of whose total assets are assets held for
investment. In making the determination described in clause (iii) above, the
stock and securities of any subsidiary of a company will be disregarded and
such company will be deemed to own its ratable share of such subsidiary's
assets if such company owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of
all classes of stock of such subsidiary that are entitled to vote or 50
percent or more of the total value of all of the outstanding stock of such
subsidiary. In addition, in determining the fair market value of its total
assets for purposes of making this representation, East will exclude any cash
and cash items (such as receivables), government securities, and any other
asset acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for the purpose
of causing East not to be characterized as an entity described in clause (i),
(ii), or (iii) above or causing East to meet the requirements of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(ii). 
---|---|--- 
  



    

Exhibit G - 2

 



    



   | 8.| The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein are
the result of arm's length negotiations conducted by and among the parties
thereto and their respective agents and advisors. The Merger Agreement sets
forth all of the rights and obligations and represents the entire
understanding of the Parties regarding the Merger. There are no
other material agreements, documents, understandings, or similar arrangements
related to the Merger except for the Transaction Documents. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

9.  The Merger will be effected for the bona fide business purposes described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and not for purposes of tax avoidance.

  



  

10.  Neither East nor any of its affiliates is or will be a party to any oral or written agreement relating to the Merger that may cause any of the statements and representations set forth in this Officer's Certificate to be untrue, incorrect, or incomplete in any material respect.

  



   | 11.| The fair market value of the Central Common Stock to be received
by each East Stockholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the East Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor (based on the respective approximate fair
market value of Central Common Stock and East Common Stock prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement), as determined by arm's length
negotiations between the management of Central and the management of East. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| To the knowledge of East, neither Central nor any person related
to Central within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(3),
(4), or (5) and/or Section 267(b) (a " _Central Related Person_
") (including, following the Merger, East) has any plan, intention, or
obligation to redeem, reacquire, or purchase after the Merger, directly or
indirectly (including through partnerships or through third parties), any
Central Common Stock received by East Stockholders in the Merger, except for
any plan or intention to purchase such stock on the open market as part of a
repurchase program, which purchases and program satisfy the requirements of
Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, or pursuant to one or more
accelerated share repurchase agreements (together, a " _Central Stock
Repurchase Program_ "). To the knowledge of East, acquisitions of Central
Common Stock pursuant to a Central Stock Repurchase Program will not be
matters negotiated by Central with East or any holders of the East Common

Program to favor participation by any holder of Central Common Stock relative
to any other holder of Central Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.| To the knowledge of East, neither Central nor any Central Related
Person has any plan, intention, or obligation to acquire, directly or

third parties), any stock of East (other than pursuant to the Merger
Agreement) on or prior to the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

Exhibit G - 3

 



    



   | 14.| To the knowledge of East, neither Central, Merger Sub nor any
Central Related Person has any plan, intention, or obligation to make any
distribution, directly or indirectly, to former East Stockholders after the
Merger, other than normal pro rata dividends or distributions made to all
Central Stockholders (which for purposes of this Officer's Certificate shall
include any variable pro rata dividends or distributions of the type paid by
publicly traded companies in the oil and gas industry) or repurchases
pursuant to a Central Stock Repurchase Program. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.| East has not caused, and will not cause in connection with the
Merger, any extraordinary distribution with respect to East Common Stock to
be declared or paid prior to the Effective Time. Neither East nor any person
related to East within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(3), (4), or (5), directly or indirectly (including, without
limitation, through partnerships or through third parties), (i) has
participated, or will participate in connection with the Merger, in
any purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition or acquisition of East
Common Stock or (ii) has paid or will pay, prior to, in contemplation of, or
in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the
Merger is a part, any amount to, or on behalf of, any East Stockholder in
connection with any purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition or
acquisition of East Common Stock (except, in each case of clause (i) or (ii),
as set forth in the Merger Agreement or pursuant to normal pro rata dividends
or distributions to all holders of Central Common Stock (which for purposes of
this Officer's Certificate shall include any variable pro rata dividends or
distributions of the type paid by publicly traded companies in the oil and gas
industry) or repurchases of Central Common Stock pursuant to a Central Stock
Repurchase Program). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.| At the Effective Time, East will not have outstanding any
warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right, in
each case, pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in East that, if
exercised, would affect Central's acquisition or retention of control of East
within the meaning of Section 368(c). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.| Following the Merger, East has no plan or intention to issue
additional shares of its stock that would result in Central losing control of
East within the meaning of Section 368(c). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.| Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by East and will not
transfer to East any assets subject to liabilities in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.| East conducts a historic business for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(d). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.| Following the Merger, East or one or more other members of
Central's qualified group (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will continue East's historic business or use a significant
portion of East's historic business assets in a business, in each case,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.| After the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will hold (i) at
least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70
percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by East immediately
prior to the Merger and (ii) at least 90 percent of the fair market value of
the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of
this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets of East
or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts
(i) used (or to be used) by East or Merger Sub to pay Merger expenses, (ii)
paid (or to be paid) by East or Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities,
warrants, or options of East as part of any overall plan of which the Merger
is a part, (iii) used (or to be used) to repay debt, other than any debt that
is refinanced in connection with the Merger, and (iv) distributed (or to be
distributed) by East or Merger Sub to East Stockholders or Merger Sub
stockholders, as applicable (except for regular, normal dividends), as part
of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. East has not disposed of
any assets prior to the Merger which disposition was made in contemplation of,
or as part of, the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Exhibit G - 4

 



    



   | 22.| Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, each of the
parties to the Merger Agreement has paid and will pay only its own expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger. East has not paid and will not pay,
directly or indirectly, any expenses incurred by any East Stockholder in
connection with or in contemplation of the Merger. To the best knowledge of
East, each East Stockholder has paid and will pay its own expenses, if any,
incurred in connection with the Merger, and no such expenses have been or
will be reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by Central, Merger Sub or East. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23.| There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Central,
any Central Subsidiary or Merger Sub (or any of its subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and East or any East Subsidiary, on the other hand, that was issued or
acquired, or will be settled, at a discount. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.| The payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
Central Common Stock to East Stockholders is solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares and does
not represent separately bargained-for consideration. With the possible
exception of East Stockholders who hold through multiple brokers or multiple
accounts, no East Stockholder will receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than the value of one full Central Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.| East has no issued and outstanding stock (or any other interest
treated as stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes) other than East Common
Stock. In the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding East Common Stock will
be acquired solely for Central Common Stock, except as described in
representation 24 above. No stock of Merger Sub will be issued in the
Merger. No liabilities of any East Stockholder have been or will be assumed
by Central, any Central Related Person, Merger Sub, or East, nor will any
East Common Stock be acquired subject to any liabilities. For purposes of this
representation, if any East Common Stock is exchanged for cash or other
property originating with Central, such East Shares will be treated as
acquired by Central in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 26.| None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any East
Stockholder that is an employee of, or otherwise provides services to, East
or any of its subsidiaries was or will be separate consideration for, or
allocable to, any East Common Stock held by such Stockholder. None of the
Central Common Stock that will be received in the Merger by any East
Stockholder that is an employee of, or otherwise provides services to, East or
any of the East Subsidiaries will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any employment, consulting, or similar agreement. Any compensation paid
(or to be paid) to any East Stockholder that is an employee of, or otherwise
provides services to, East or any of its subsidiaries (i) was (or will be)
for services actually rendered or to be rendered, (ii) was (or will be)
commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length
for similar services, and (iii) has been (or will be) bargained for
independent of negotiations specifically regarding the consideration to be
paid for East Common Stock in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Exhibit G - 5

 



    



   | 27.| East has not (and, to the best knowledge of East, no East
Stockholder has) negotiated the direct or indirect sale, exchange, or other
disposition of Central Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to Central or
any Central Related Person. There is no plan, intention, understanding, or
arrangement between Central or any Central Related Person, or any of
their respective shareholders, on the one hand, and East or, to the best
knowledge of East, any East Stockholder, on the other hand, that any East
Stockholder's ownership of Central Common Stock received in the Merger would
be transitory. For purposes of this representation, any reference to East or
Central includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such
corporation, except that East is not treated as a predecessor of Central and
Central is not treated as a successor of East. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 28.| Except for any publicly traded bonds issued by Central, there
will be no indebtedness between any East Stockholder, on the one hand, and
Central, on the other hand, at the time of the Merger, and no indebtedness
will be created in favor of any East Stockholder as a result of the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.| No East Stockholder will retain any rights in the East Common
Stock acquired by Central pursuant to the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 30.| Immediately after the Effective Time, the fair market value of
the assets of East will exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the
liabilities, if any, to which such assets are subject. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 31.| East is a corporation within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(3). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 32.| East is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 33.| The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations
set forth herein on behalf of East.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the opinion (the " _Opinion_ ") to be delivered by
Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _Kirkland_ ") in connection with the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of September 26, 2020 by
and among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (" _Central_ "),
East Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Central (" _Merger Sub_ ," together with Central, the " _Central Parties_
"), and WPX Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _East_ ") (the Central
Parties, together with East, the " _Parties_ ," and each, a " _Party_
"), regarding certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), you have requested certain representations,
warranties and covenants with respect to East, Merger Sub and Central. This
officer's certificate (the " _Officer 's Certificate_") is being provided to
you in response to that request. All capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meaning specified, either directly or by reference, in
the Merger Agreement. Except as otherwise provided, all "Section" references
are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and all
" _Treasury Regulations Section_ " references are to the Treasury regulations
promulgated under the Code.

  



  

Recognizing and acknowledging that Kirkland will rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and statements set forth in this Officer's
Certificate in delivering the Tax Opinion, and that the Tax Opinion will be
based on an assumption that all of the representations, warranties, covenants
and statements set forth herein are true, accurate, and complete in all
respects without regard to any qualification for knowledge, belief or
otherwise, the undersigned officer of Central (the " _Central Officer_ ")
hereby represents and certifies, in his or her capacity as an officer of
Central and not in his or her individual capacity, on behalf of Central,
that, to the extent the following statements and representations relate to the
Central Parties (and to the extent otherwise without reason to believe to the
contrary) such statements and representations are true and correct as of the
date hereof and will be true and correct at the Effective Time (as if made as
of the Effective Time) and through the subsequent periods specified herein:

  



   | 1.| The Central Officer is familiar with, or has relied on the
knowledge of other Central officers that are familiar with, the matters set
forth in this Officer's Certificate, and has made such investigations of
factual matters as the Central Officer has deemed reasonably necessary for
the purpose of making the representations, warranties, covenants and
statements in this Officers' Certificate. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Exhibit H - 1

 



    



   | 2.| The facts, representations, and warranties relating to the Merger,
as described or otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement and the
registration statement on Form S-4 filed publicly by Central with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on [●], as amended or supplemented through
the date hereof (the " _Registration Statement_ "), the proxy
statement/prospectus included as a part of the Registration Statement (the "
_Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and the other documents referred to in the
Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (collectively, the " _Transaction Documents_ "), in each
case, insofar as such facts, representations, and warranties pertain to
Merger Sub, Central, and their respective affiliates, are true and correct in
all material respects (giving effect to the qualifications in the Disclosure
Schedules). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)) or by applicable state
or local income or franchise tax law, none of Central or any of its affiliates
will take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income or
franchise tax return, or take any other U.S. tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with (i) the Reorganization Treatment or (ii) the
representations made herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| Each of Merger Sub, Central, and the Central Subsidiaries that was
or will be a party to the Merger had and will have all requisite corporate
powers and authority to undertake and consummate the Merger.

   | 5.| Each of Merger Sub, Central, and the Central Subsidiaries that was
or will be a party to the Merger had or will have complied and will comply
with all requirements under the relevant operating documents and local law to
effect the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the material
terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents, and none of the material
terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or modified. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| Neither Central nor Merger Sub is (i) a regulated investment
company, (ii) a real estate investment trust, or (iii) a corporation 50
percent or more of the fair market value of whose total assets are stock and
securities and 80 percent or more of the fair market value of whose total
assets are assets held for investment. In making the determination
described in clause (iii) above, the stock and securities of any subsidiary
of a company will be disregarded and such company will be deemed to own its
ratable share of such subsidiary's assets if such company owns 50 percent or
more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of such subsidiary
that are entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total value of all of
the outstanding stock of such subsidiary. In addition, in determining the
fair market value of its total assets for purposes of making this
representation, Central and Merger Sub will exclude any cash and cash items
(such as receivables), government securities, and any other asset
acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for the purpose of
causing Central or Merger Sub not to be characterized as an entity described
in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above or causing Central or Merger Sub to meet
the requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Exhibit H - 2

 



    



   | 8.| The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein are
the result of arm's length negotiations conducted by and among the parties
thereto and their respective agents and advisors. The Merger Agreement sets
forth all of the rights and obligations and represents the entire
understanding of the Parties regarding the Merger. There are no
other material agreements, documents, understandings, or similar arrangements
related to the Merger except for the Transaction Documents. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| The Merger will be effected for the bona fide business purposes
described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| None of Merger Sub, Central, or any of their respective
affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, East and the East
Subsidiaries) is or will be a party to any oral or written agreement relating
to the Merger that may cause any of the statements and representations set
forth in this Officer's Certificate to be untrue, incorrect, or incomplete in
any material respect. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 11.| The fair market value of the Central Common Stock to be received
by each East Stockholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the East Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor (based on the respective approximate fair
market value of Central Common Stock and East Common Stock prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement), as determined by arm's length
negotiations between the management of Central and the management of East. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| Neither Central nor any person related to Central within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (4), or (5) and/or
Section 267(b) (a " _Related Person_ ") (including, following the
Merger, East) has any plan, intention, or obligation to redeem, reacquire, or
purchase after the Merger, directly or indirectly (including through
partnerships or through third parties), any Central Common Stock received by
East Stockholders in the Merger, except for any plan or intention to purchase
such stock on the open market as part of a repurchase program, which purchases
and program satisfy the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B.
701, or pursuant to one or more accelerated share repurchase agreements
(together, a " _Central Stock Repurchase Program_ "). Acquisitions of Central
Common Stock pursuant to a Central Stock Repurchase Program will not be
matters negotiated by Central with East or any holders of the East Common
Stock, and there is no plan or intention for any Central Stock Repurchase
Program to favor participation by any holder of Central Common Stock
relative to any other holder of Central Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.| Neither Central nor any Related Person has any plan, intention,
or obligation to acquire, directly or indirectly (including, without

(other than pursuant to the Merger Agreement) on or prior to the Effective
Time. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.| Neither Central nor any Related Person has any plan, intention,
or obligation to make any distribution, directly or indirectly, to former
East Stockholders after the Merger, other than normal pro rata dividends or
distributions made to all Central Stockholders (which for purposes of this
Officer's Certificate shall include any variable pro rata dividends or
distributions of the type paid by publicly traded companies in the oil and
gas industry) or repurchases pursuant to a Central Stock Repurchase Program. 
---|---|--- 
  



     

   

Exhibit H - 3

 



    



   | 15.| Neither Merger Sub, Central nor any Related Person, directly or

third parties), (i) has participated, or will participate in connection with
the Merger, in any purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition or
acquisition of East Common Stock or (ii) has paid or will pay, prior to, in
contemplation of, or in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a
plan of which the Merger is a part, any amount to, or on behalf of, any East

pro rata dividends or distributions to all holders of Central Common Stock
(which for purposes of this Officer's Certificate shall include any variable
pro rata dividends or distributions of the type paid by publicly traded
companies in the oil and gas industry) or repurchases of Central Common Stock
pursuant to a Central Stock Repurchase Program). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.| Central has no plan or intention following the Merger to (i)
liquidate East or Central (including a deemed liquidation from an entity
classification election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3), (ii)
merge East or Central with or into another corporation or entity, (iii) sell
or otherwise dispose of any of the stock of East (other than a
transfer contemplated by Section 368(a)(2)(C) or the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, such as a contribution of the East Common Stock by Central to
Central Energy Corporation (Oklahoma), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central)
or (iv) cause East to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets outside
the ordinary course of business. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.| Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by East and will not
transfer to East any assets subject to liabilities in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.| Following the Merger, East or one or more other members of
Central's qualified group (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will continue East's historic business or use a significant
portion of East's historic business assets in a business, in each case,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.| After the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will hold (i) at
least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70
percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by East immediately

the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of
this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets of East
or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts
(i) used (or to be used) by East or Merger Sub to pay Merger expenses, (ii)
paid (or to be paid) by East or Merger Sub to redeem stock,
securities, warrants, or options of East as part of any overall plan of which
the Merger is a part, (iii) used (or to be used) to repay debt, other than

made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



     

   

Exhibit H - 4

 



    



   | 20.| Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, each of the
parties to the Merger Agreement has paid and will pay only its own expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger. Neither Central nor Merger Sub has
paid nor will pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses incurred by any East
Stockholder in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger. To the best
knowledge of Central, each East Stockholder has paid and will pay its own
expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and no such
expenses have been or will be reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by Central,
Merger Sub or East. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.| There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Central,
any Central Subsidiary or Merger Sub (or any of their respective
subsidiaries), on the one hand, and East or any East Subsidiary, on the other
hand, that was issued or acquired, or will be settled, at a discount. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.| The payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
Central Common Stock to East Stockholders is solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares and does
not represent separately bargained-for consideration. With the possible
exception of East Stockholders who hold through multiple brokers or multiple
accounts, no East Stockholder will receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than the value of one full Central Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 23.| No liabilities of any East Stockholder have been or will be
assumed by Central, Merger Sub, East or any Related Person, nor will any East
Common Stock be acquired subject to any liabilities. For purposes of this
representation, if any East Common Stock is exchanged for cash or other
property originating with Central, such East Shares will be treated
as acquired by Central in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.| Immediately before the Effective Time, Central will own all of
the stock of Merger Sub and will be in control of Merger Sub within the
meaning of Section 368(c). At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will not have
outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type
of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Merger Sub (or,
following the Merger, stock in East) that, if exercised, would affect
Central's retention of control of East within the meaning of Section 368(c).
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and has not owned any assets since its
formation (other than assets with nominal value contributed upon formation),
incurred any indebtedness for money borrowed, issued stock or any other
equity to any person, or engaged in any trade or business activities or
operations. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.| Central has no present plan or intention to, following the
Merger, permit East to issue additional shares of its stock that would result
in Central losing control of East within the meaning of Section 368(c). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 26.| Central has not (and, to the best knowledge of Central, no East
Stockholder has) negotiated the direct or indirect sale, exchange, or other
disposition of Central Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to Central or
any Central Related Person. There is no plan, intention, understanding, or
arrangement between or among Central, East or any of their respective
shareholders, that any East Stockholder's ownership of Central Common Stock
received in the Merger would be transitory. For purposes of this
representation, any reference to East or Central includes a reference to any
successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that East is not treated
as a predecessor of Central and Central is not treated as a successor of
East. 
---|---|--- 
  



     

   

Exhibit H - 5

 



    



   | 27.| Except for any publicly traded bonds issued by Central, there
will be no indebtedness between any East Stockholder, on the one hand, and
Central, on the other hand, at the time of the Merger, and no indebtedness
will be created in favor of any East Stockholder as a result of the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 28.| No East Stockholder will retain any rights in the East Common
Stock acquired by Central pursuant to the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.| Immediately after the Effective Time, the fair market value of
the assets of Central will exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the
liabilities, if any, to which such assets are subject. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 30.| Each of Central and Merger Sub is a corporation organized under
the laws of Delaware. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 31.| Neither Merger Sub nor Central is under the jurisdiction of a
court in a title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section
368(a)(3)(A). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 32.| The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations
set forth herein on behalf of Merger Sub and Central. 
---|---|---
