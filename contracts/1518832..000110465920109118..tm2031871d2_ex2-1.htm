of East and the East Subsidiaries set forth in the East Reserve Report fairly reflect, in all material respects, the proved
Hydrocarbon reserves of East and the East Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with the rules
promulgated by the SEC, as applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods reflected therein. Except for changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the East Reserve Report that would be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an East Material Adverse Effect. The estimates of proved Hydrocarbon
reserves used by East and the East Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the East Reserve Report complied in all
material respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, and the estimates of proved Hydrocarbon reserves
provided to NSAI in connection with the preparation of the East NSAI Audit Report complied in all material respects with Rule
4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.</P>

adopted for East Employees and Central Employees under which no participants receive credit for service before the effective
date of the New Plan). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph&nbsp;(b): (i) each Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable East Benefit Plan or Central
Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the
 &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="color: windowtext"><B><U>Old Plans</U></B></FONT>&rdquo;); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Employee, Central shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Central shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee&rsquo;s participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.</P>

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy of any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable
relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that
with respect to any damage claim that might be brought against any Stockholder or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement,
and without regard to whether such claim sounds in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory of relief, that
damages are limited to actual damages and expressly waive any right to recover special damages, including, without
limitation, lost profits as well as any punitive or exemplary damages. In the event of any litigation over the terms of this
Agreement, the prevailing party in any such litigation shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs
incurred in connection with such litigation. The parties hereto further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof.
In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents that each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of such courts listed in this <U>Section 9</U> in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that each party hereto irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum
and all other defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding, and (c) waives any right to trial by jury
with respect to any claim or proceeding related to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
ANY OF SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER

Each of the Investor and EnCap shall hold, and cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, financing sources and other consultants
and advisors (&ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-variant: normal; text-transform: none"><B><I>Representatives</I></B></FONT>&rdquo;) to

other than in connection with a disclosure in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or document request from, a
regulatory or self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or auditor, the party disclosing such information shall provide the
other party with prior written notice of such permitted disclosure), all nonpublic records, books, contracts, instruments,
computer data and other data and information (collectively, &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-variant: normal; text-transform: none"><B><I>Information</I></B></FONT>&rdquo;)
concerning the Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries furnished to it or the Investor Director by or on behalf
of the Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries (except to the extent that such information can be shown by the
party receiving such Information to have been (a)&nbsp;previously known by such party from other sources; <I>provided</I>
that such source was not known by such party to be bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality
to the other party, (b)&nbsp;in the public domain through no violation of this <U>Section&nbsp;5.10</U> by such party or

or disclose such Information to any other person, except its Representatives (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Portfolio Company, unless such Portfolio Company enters into a joinder agreement with the Company), or use such Information
other than in connection with evaluating and taking actions with respect to such Person&rsquo;s ownership interest in the
Company. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Investor and EnCap may, in the ordinary course of their respective
businesses, evaluate investments in the energy industry and that they are actively seeking to invest in energy related
projects in a variety of areas, including the provision of fresh water and disposal of produced water in connection with oil
and gas exploration and development operations. The Company understands that the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Director
will retain certain mental impressions of Information, which are indistinguishable from generalized industry knowledge.
Accordingly, the Company agrees that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Director
are not precluded from pursuing investments solely because of such retained mental impressions. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall apply to any action taken independently by any
Portfolio Company so long as the Investor or EnCap has not provided such Portfolio Company with any Information. For purposes
of clarification, no such Portfolio Company shall be deemed to have been provided with Information solely as a result of the
Investor, EnCap, any Investor Director or any Representative (whether such Person has been provided with or has knowledge of
Information) serving on the board of such Portfolio Company (provided that such board member does not use Information in
connection with the business of such Portfolio Company).</P>

by Written Consent of Stockholders</U>. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding
stock having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting
at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. The secretary shall give prompt
notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing. Delivery made to the Corporation&rsquo;s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in
the manner required by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.9</U> within sixty (60) days of the first date on which a written consent is so
delivered to the Corporation. Any person executing a consent may provide, whether through instruction to an agent or
otherwise, that such a consent will be effective at a future time (including a time determined upon the happening of an
event), no later than sixty (60) days after such instruction is given or such provision is made, if evidence of such
instruction or provision is provided to the Corporation. Unless otherwise provided, any such consent shall be revocable prior
to its becoming effective. An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or
proxy holder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxy holder, shall be deemed to be written
and signed for the purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.9</U>, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is
delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by
the stockholder or proxy holder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxy holder and (ii) the
date on which such stockholder or proxy holder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. A
consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed delivered to the Corporation upon the earliest of: (i) when the
consent enters an information processing system, if any, designated by the Corporation for receiving consents, so long as the
electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and the Corporation is able to retrieve that
electronic transmission; (ii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Corporation&rsquo;s principal
place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
the stockholders are recorded; (iii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Corporation&rsquo;s
registered office by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) when delivered in such other
manner, if any, provided by resolution of the Board. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in
writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing
could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a
meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation as
provided above in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.9</U>.</P>

 &#8212; The Board does not believe it should establish term limits. While term limits could help ensure that there are fresh ideas
and viewpoints available to the Board, they have the disadvantage of causing the Company to lose the contribution of Directors
who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company and its operations and thereby provide
an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. The Board believes an annual assessment of Board and committee performance
provides each Director an appropriate opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of the Board, and to confirm a Director&#8217;s
decision to continue as a member of the Board.</P>

Each of the Investor and EnCap shall hold, and cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, managers,

and advisors (&ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-variant: normal; text-transform: none"><B><I>Representatives</I></B></FONT>&rdquo;) to

other than in connection with a disclosure in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or document request from, a
regulatory or self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or auditor, the party disclosing such information shall provide the
other party with prior written notice of such permitted disclosure), all nonpublic records, books, contracts, instruments,
computer data and other data and information (collectively, &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-variant: normal; text-transform: none"><B><I>Information</I></B></FONT>&rdquo;)
concerning the Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries furnished to it or the Investor Director by or on behalf
of the Company, East or any of their respective subsidiaries (except to the extent that such information can be shown by the
party receiving such Information to have been (a)&nbsp;previously known by such party from other sources; <I>provided</I>
that such source was not known by such party to be bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality
to the other party, (b)&nbsp;in the public domain through no violation of this <U>Section&nbsp;5.10</U> by such party or

or disclose such Information to any other person, except its Representatives (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Portfolio Company, unless such Portfolio Company enters into a joinder agreement with the Company), or use such Information
other than in connection with evaluating and taking actions with respect to such Person&rsquo;s ownership interest in the
Company. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Investor and EnCap may, in the ordinary course of their respective
businesses, evaluate investments in the energy industry and that they are actively seeking to invest in energy related
projects in a variety of areas, including the provision of fresh water and disposal of produced water in connection with oil
and gas exploration and development operations. The Company understands that the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Director
will retain certain mental impressions of Information, which are indistinguishable from generalized industry knowledge.
Accordingly, the Company agrees that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Director
are not precluded from pursuing investments solely because of such retained mental impressions. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall apply to any action taken independently by any
Portfolio Company so long as the Investor or EnCap has not provided such Portfolio Company with any Information. For purposes
of clarification, no such Portfolio Company shall be deemed to have been provided with Information solely as a result of the
Investor, EnCap, any Investor Director or any Representative (whether such Person has been provided with or has knowledge of
Information) serving on the board of such Portfolio Company (provided that such board member does not use Information in
connection with the business of such Portfolio Company).</P>
