all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances on Acquired Assets other
than the Acquired Company Shares, it being understood that any such

(collectively, the " _Tangible Personal Property_ ");

  



  

(c) _Contracts_. Subject to _Section 10.6_ hereof, all rights under (i) all

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Assigned Permits_ ");

  



  

(h) _Business Records_. To the extent transferable under applicable law, all
books, records, files and papers, whether in hard copy or computer format, to
the extent used in the Business or otherwise relating to the Acquired Assets

connection with the exercise by a third party of any right of first refusal,
preemptive right or similar right prior to the Initial Closing with respect
to the purchase of any JV Interest. For the avoidance of doubt, "Acquired
Assets" when used in this Agreement with respect to the Joint Ventures and
the Venture Investments shall mean solely the equity interest in, and not the
underlying business operations or assets or liabilities of, the applicable
Business Entity;

2.2 _Closing_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree to conduct the Initial Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (all such transactions, including the
transactions contemplated by the Additional Closings, being referred to
herein as the " _Contemplated Transactions_ ") at the offices of Winston and
Strawn LLP, 35 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 AM (local time)
on the first day of the fiscal month of the Seller following the month in
which the conditions precedent to the Initial Closing listed in _Article 6_
shall have been satisfied or waived; _provided_ that if such satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions precedent to the Initial Closing listed in _Article
6_ occurs within ten (10) business days of the last business day of
the fiscal month of the Seller, then the Initial Closing shall occur on the
first day of the second fiscal month of the Seller following such occurrence
(such date of the Initial Closing, the " _Initial Closing Date_ "). The
effective time of the Initial Closing for tax, operational and all other
matters will be deemed to be 12:01 AM (local time) in each jurisdiction
included in the Initial Closing, on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) It is the intention of the parties that the closing of the sale and
purchase of Acquired Assets and the assumption of Assumed Liabilities will
occur with respect to all countries and all JV Interests on the Initial
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to the JV Interests
and not more than an aggregate of five (5) countries not included in the
Initial Closing Jurisdictions, if the conditions set forth in _Article 6_
are not satisfied with respect to the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities
located in such countries, or such JV Interest, as of the Initial Closing
Date, the closing with respect to such Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, or such JV Interest, may be deferred until the date
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ are satisfied or, if
permissible, waived. The parties shall, as soon as reasonably practicable,
hold Additional Closings for the purpose of transferring such Acquired Assets
and assuming such Assumed Liabilities in such countries, or transferring such
JV Interests, following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ for such Additional Closing, unless the parties
mutually agree on a different date for such Additional Closing. Each
Additional Closing shall occur as of 12:01 AM, local time, on the date of
such Additional Closing. For the purposes of each Additional Closing,
references to the "Initial Closing Date" in _Section 1.1_ through _Section
1.4_ shall be read as references to the "applicable Closing Date."

  



  

(c) From and after the Initial Closing, and subject to compliance with
applicable law, the Seller shall, or shall cause other members of the Seller
Group to, hold and operate the Acquired Assets (including any JV Interest)
that are not transferred to the Purchaser at the Initial Closing (the "
_Remaining Assets_ ") at the direction of, and for the sole and
exclusive benefit of, the Purchaser Group until the applicable Additional
Closing with respect to the country where the applicable Remaining Assets are
located. Subject to applicable law, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use
their respective Reasonable Efforts to establish arrangements which, from and
after the Initial Closing, result in the Purchaser Group receiving all the
benefits and bearing all the costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to
the Remaining Assets.  The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good
faith prior to the Initial Closing Date to implement such arrangements as
either party reasonably may request of the other party to ensure that, to the
greatest extent permitted by applicable law, from and after the Initial
Closing, the economic benefits and burdens of the Acquired Assets and the
entire Business (including the Remaining Assets) are held and borne by the
Purchaser Group. At the reasonable request of the Purchaser,

  



        
   

  



  

and subject to applicable law and the internal policies of the Seller that
have been provided to the Purchaser prior to the date hereof, the Seller
shall, and shall cause other members of the Seller Group to, enter into a
power of attorney or other similar arrangement with the Purchaser to allow
the Purchaser to exercise its rights under this _Section 2.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 2.2_ to the
contrary, the completion of the closing of the purchase and sale of
the Malaysia Acquired Assets and the assignment and assumption of the
Malaysia Assumed Liabilities (the " _Malaysia Closing_ ") shall occur, at
such place as the Parties may agree in writing, on the Termination Date (as
defined in the Malaysia Interim Operating Agreement).  The date on which the
Malaysia Closing occurs shall be referred to as the " _Malaysia Closing Date_
", and except as expressly provided herein, the Malaysia Closing shall for
all purposes be deemed effective as of 12:01 AM, Malaysia time, on the
Malaysia Closing Date.

place, all of which shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously, and no
action shall be deemed to have been completed or any document delivered until

been completed or such document should have been delivered:

Group in actual possession or control of the Acquired Assets.

Acquired Assets; and

  



  

(xii) a certificate signed by an officer of the Purchaser as required by

more wholly-owned subsidiaries or Affiliates to (i) purchase Acquired Assets
(including Assumed Contracts), (ii) assume Assumed Liabilities, and/or (iii)
employ Transferred Employees on and after the Purchaser Employment Date (any
subsidiary of the Purchaser that shall be properly designated by the
Purchaser in accordance with this clause, a member of the " _Purchaser Group_
"). In furtherance of its rights under this _Section 2.4_, the Purchaser
has initially designated the Person(s) listed on _Exhibit L_ as members of
the Purchaser Group.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser, by way of a written notice to be delivered to the Seller
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and in no event later
than the thirtieth (30th) day prior to the Initial Closing Date, may amend
_Exhibit L_; _provided_ , that any change in the Purchaser Group shall not
be permitted if such change is reasonably expected to delay the anticipated
Initial Closing Date; and _provided_ _further_  that such amended _Exhibit
L_ shall contain appropriate information about the members of the Purchaser
Group listed on such amended _Exhibit L_.

  



  

2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Schedule 2.5(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Most
Recent Statement of Net Assets, as adjusted (i) to reflect Net Assets as if
the Business had not factored any receivables prior to the date shown
therein, (ii) to exclude the impact of the Joint

  



        
   

  



  

Ventures and the Venture Investments and (iii) to exclude the line items for
"Goodwill," "Intangible Assets," "Accumulated Amortization  Intangible
Assets," "Property, Plant and Equipment, Net" and "Sold Receivables Liability"
(as so adjusted, the " _Adjusted Most Recent Statement of Net Assets_ ").

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Initial Closing Date but in no
event later than ninety (90) days thereafter, the Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Seller an unaudited statement of Net Assets as of the close of
business (Chicago time) on the Initial Closing Date (the " _Preliminary
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets_ "), which shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the Adjusted Most Recent Statement of Net Assets, provided
that such statement shall not be adjusted as set forth in _Section 2.5(a)(i)_
which shall result, for the avoidance of doubt, in the exclusion of any
factored receivables as of the Initial Closing Date (such adjustment, an
illustrative example of which is set forth in _Schedule 2.5(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the " _Closing Date Factored Receivables
Adjustment_ "), and which statement shall reflect Net Assets as of the
Initial Closing Date as so adjusted (the " _Preliminary Net Assets_ "). Each
party agrees to consult in good faith and cooperate with the other party and
its employees regarding the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Date
Statement of Net Assets, including by making its employees available to the
other party as reasonably requested. The parties agree that the
Preliminary Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall be prepared with
respect to the entire Business, including any portion of the Acquired Assets
and Assumed Liabilities that transfers or is assumed at an Additional
Closing. In addition, in the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Date
Statement of Net Assets, the items that would have constituted Malaysia
Acquired Assets or Malaysia Assumed Liabilities if the Malaysia Closing had
occurred at the same time as the Initial Closing shall be treated as assets
or liabilities, as the case may be, notwithstanding that the transfer,
assignment and assumption of such assets and liabilities will not occur until
the Malaysia Closing.  Together with the Preliminary Closing Date Statement
of Net Assets, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a preliminary
reference statement (the " _Malaysia Preliminary Reference Statement_ " and,
together with the Preliminary Closing Date Statement of Net Assets, the "
_Preliminary Statements_ ") with respect to the items set forth on the
Preliminary Closing Date Statement of Net Assets that would have constituted
Malaysia Acquired Assets or Malaysia Assumed Liabilities if the Malaysia
Closing had occurred at the same time as the Initial Closing and otherwise
prepared in accordance with the standards used to prepare the Preliminary
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets (the excess of the Malaysia Acquired
Assets over the Malaysia Assumed Liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Malaysia Transferred Net Assets_ ").

  



  

(c) The Seller shall have sixty (60) days following delivery to the Seller of
the Preliminary Statements during which to review the Preliminary Statements,
and to notify the Purchaser if it believes that (i) the Preliminary
Statements were not prepared on a basis consistent with the Adjusted Most
Recent Statement of Net Assets (as modified by the Closing Date Factored
Receivables Adjustment), (ii) the Preliminary Statements contain mathematical
errors, or (iii) the calculation of Net Assets was not in accordance with the
definition of Net Assets contained herein, and, in any case, the Sellers
notice shall specify the reasons therefor in reasonable detail. If the Seller
fails to properly notify the Purchaser of any such dispute within such sixty
(60)-day period, the Preliminary Statements and the Preliminary Net Assets
reflected on the Preliminary Closing Date Statement of Net Assets shall be
deemed final. In the event that the Seller shall so notify the Purchaser of
any dispute, the Seller and the Purchaser shall

  



        
   

  



  

cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible, and
upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Preliminary Statements
and Preliminary Net Assets shall be made in accordance with the agreement of
the Purchaser and the Seller.

  



  

(d) If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute
within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as the Purchaser and the
Seller shall mutually agree in writing) of the Sellers delivery of such
notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm,
and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties; _provided_
, _however_ , that, unless the Independent Accounting Firm determines that,
with respect to the disputed items only, the Preliminary Statements (i) were
not prepared on a basis consistent with the Adjusted Most Recent Statement of
Net Assets (as modified by the Closing Date Factored Receivables Adjustment),
(ii) contain mathematical errors, or (iii) the calculation of Net Assets was
not in accordance with the definition of Net Assets contained herein, the
Preliminary Statements shall be the Final Closing Date Statement of Net
Assets and the Malaysia Final Reference Statement, respectively. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall mutually select the Independent Accounting Firm, but
if the Seller and the Purchaser cannot mutually agree on the identity of
the Independent Accounting Firm, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall
each submit to the other partys independent auditor the name of a
national accounting firm other than PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP,
and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from these two
firms by the independent auditors of the two parties.  If no national
accounting firm shall be willing to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm,
then a nationally recognized (in the United States) expert in public
accounting shall be selected to serve as such, such selection to be according
to the above procedures. Any fees and expenses relating to the engagement of
the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(d)_ shall be allocated between the Seller and the Purchaser
such that the amount paid by the Seller bears the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller bears to the
total dollar amount to the disputed items that were submitted for resolution
to the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Purchaser shall pay the balance.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every reasonable
commercial effort to perform its services within thirty (30) days of
submission of the Preliminary Statements to it and, in any case, as promptly
as practicable after such submission. The Final Closing Date Statement of
Net Assets and the Final Net Assets reflected thereon, and the Malaysia Final
Reference Statement, shall then be prepared by the Seller based on the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm.

  



  

(e) If the amount of Final Net Assets less the amount of Reference Net Assets
is a negative amount (the " _Negative Adjustment_ "), then the Seller shall
pay the Purchaser the absolute value of the amount of such difference. In
such event, the Seller shall, within ten (10) business days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_ or  _Section 2.5(d)_, make payment to the Purchaser by
wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of the Negative
Adjustment as determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.  If the amount
of Final Net Assets less the amount of Reference Net Assets is a positive
amount (the " _Positive Adjustment_ "), then Additional Excluded Accounts
Receivable in an amount equal in value to the Positive Adjustment shall be
deemed to be Excluded Assets pursuant to _Section 1.2(q)_. In such event, the
parties shall, within ninety (90) days after the final determination of the
Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets, jointly designate an amount,
equal to the Positive Adjustment, of Accounts Receivable of the Seller

  



        
   

  



  

Group received by either the Purchaser Group or the Seller Group with respect
to the Business, subject to _Schedule 2.5(e)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. All Accounts Receivable so designated shall be for the
account of the Seller and, if received by a member of the Purchaser Group,
shall have been held in trust by the Purchaser Group for the benefit of the
Seller and shall be delivered to the Seller pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 10.2_.

  



  

(f) Within ninety (90) days after the Malaysia Closing Date, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a preliminary closing statement of net assets (the "
_Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") with respect to the items that
constitute Malaysia Acquired Assets or Malaysia Assumed Liabilities. The
Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement shall be prepared on the same basis as
the Malaysia Final Reference Statement, except that (i) the
Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement shall reflect the actual Malaysia
Acquired Assets and Malaysia Assumed Liabilities transferred, assigned and
assumed at the Malaysia Closing, (ii) the amount of the reserve set for
excess and obsolete inventory set forth in the Malaysia Preliminary Closing
Statement and the Malaysia Final Closing Statement shall be the same as that
set forth in the Malaysia Final Reference Statement (and any adjustments to
such reserve during the period between the Initial Closing and the Malaysia
Closing will be held on the books and records of the Purchaser), and (iii)
any depreciation or amortization account balances related to Property, Plant
and Equipment set forth in the Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement and the
Malaysia Final Closing Statement shall be the same as that set forth in the
Malaysia Final Reference Statement (and any adjustments to such balances
during the period between the Initial Closing and the Malaysia Closing will
be held on the books and records of the Purchaser). Each party agrees to
consult in good faith and cooperate with the other party and its employees
regarding the preparation of the Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement,
including by making its employees available to the other party as reasonably
requested. The Malaysia Preliminary Closing Statement shall be subject to the
review period and dispute resolution provisions set forth in _Section
2.5(c)_ and _Section 2.5(d)_ (in both cases, read as if all references
to the "Purchaser" were references to the "Seller" therein, and vice versa)
that were applicable to the Preliminary Statements.  The Malaysia
Preliminary Closing Statement, once modified and/or agreed to in accordance
with such provisions, shall become the " _Malaysia Final Closing Statement_
".

  



  

(i) If ** __** (A)(x) the Malaysia Transferred Net Assets as stated in the
Malaysia Final Closing Statement _minus_ (y) the amount obtained by
multiplying 1.03 by the aggregate Product Cost (as defined in the Malaysia
Interim Operating Agreement) is less than (B) the Adjusted Malaysia
Transferred Net Assets, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount
equal to such deficiency, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the account designated in writing by the Purchaser, within ten (10)
business days after the date on which the Malaysia Preliminary Closing
Statement becomes the Malaysia Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(ii) If (A)(x) the Malaysia Transferred Net Assets as stated in the Malaysia
Final Closing Statement _minus_  (y) the amount obtained by multiplying 1.03
by the aggregate Product Cost (as defined in the Malaysia Interim Operating
Agreement) is greater than (B) the Adjusted Malaysia Transferred Net Assets
(such difference, the " _Positive Malaysia Adjustment_ "), then Additional
Excluded Accounts Receivable in an amount equal in value to the Positive
Malaysia Adjustment shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets pursuant to
_Section 1.2(q)_. In such event, the parties shall, within ninety

  



        
   

  



  

(90) days after the final determination of the Malaysia Final Closing
Statement, jointly designate an amount, equal to the Positive Malaysia
Adjustment, of Accounts Receivable of the Seller Group received by either the
Purchaser Group or the Seller Group with respect to the Business, subject to
_Schedule 2.5(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. All
Accounts Receivable so designated shall be for the account of the Seller and,
if received by a member of the Purchaser Group, shall have been held in trust
by the Purchaser Group for the benefit of the Seller and shall be delivered
to the Seller pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

subsection of this _Article 3_, or on a particular schedule of the Seller
EMA Disclosure Schedule, is deemed to relate to each other section or

to do business, and, to the extent legally applicable, is in good standing,
in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned, operated or leased
properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification material

(b) Each Acquired Company and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, each Joint
Venture, is a Business Entity that is duly organized, validly existing, and

where the character of its owned, operated or leased properties or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification material to the assets owned by
it, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller or the
Business. Each Acquired Company and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, each
Joint Venture, has all organizational power and authority required to carry

Date of its execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Agreements
to which it is a party and the consummation by it of the Contemplated
Transactions, as applicable. The Seller has duly and validly executed
and delivered the Principal Agreements and, on or prior to the Closing, each
member of the Seller Group will have duly and validly executed and delivered
the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party.  Assuming the due

the Seller Group to make any filing with, or obtain any material Permit,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity (except where the failure to

its material obligations under the Transaction Agreements, or as may be
necessary as a result of any facts or circumstances relating to the Purchaser
or its Affiliates), (c) result in a breach or default under, create in any

Initial Closing Date.  No Acquired Company and, to the Knowledge of the
Seller, no Joint Venture, will be required to include any material item of

sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Initial Closing
Date or (ii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Initial Closing Date
which was included as income for GAAP purposes prior to the Initial Closing
Date (and for which an offsetting liability was not created on the books of
such Acquired Company or Joint Venture) but will not be included in income
for U.S. federal income tax purposes until after the Initial Closing Date.

  



  

(i) No Acquired Company has engaged in any transaction that could affect its

10.7_, receipt of the benefit with respect to, all Shared Contracts material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Business, and provided the Purchaser
replaces the assets specified in the definition of "Excluded Assets," on the
Initial Closing Date, the Tangible Personal Property, the Inventory and the
Assumed Contracts, taking into account all provisions of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements, will be sufficient to enable the Purchaser
Group to conduct the manufacturing, research and development and sales
functions of the Business immediately following the Initial Closing in all
material respects as conducted by the Seller Group as of the date of this
Agreement (taking into account the impact of the disclosure on item 1 of
_Schedule 5.1_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule).

the Business.

respect to any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Initial
Closing, the NDA will continue in full force and effect.  Except as
contemplated by _subsection (a)_ hereof, the existence of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements and

  



        
   

  



  

the terms hereof and thereof (including the exhibits and schedules appended

purposes of the NDA.

  



  

5.6 _Regulatory Filings; Consents_.

  



  

(a) The parties will use Reasonable Efforts to agree, within thirty (30) days
following the date hereof, on a list of jurisdictions where, pursuant to
applicable Antitrust Laws, filings are required to be made or approvals are
required to be obtained prior to consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
parties agree to use Reasonable Efforts to (i) make all necessary and
appropriate filings with all applicable Governmental Entities and obtain

and the Purchaser agrees to (i) as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the date
legally required for filing and (B) the thirtieth (30th) day following the
date of execution and delivery of this Agreement, file any notification and
report forms and related material that it may be required to file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act and seek an early
termination of the applicable waiting period, and (ii) make any further
filings or information submissions that may be requested, necessary, proper
or advisable pursuant to the HSR Act. In addition, each party agrees to file
with the applicable Governmental Entity, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, any filings or similar information
submissions required under any other applicable United States federal or
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade or constituting anticompetitive
conduct (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ").  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser will be solely responsible for any and all filing
fees due under the HSR Act and any Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions outside of
the United States of America in connection with the filings described above
and neither the Seller nor any other member of the Seller Group will have any
Liability with respect to the payment of such filing fee other than its own
internal costs as well as costs and expenses of its counsel and advisors in

Governmental Entity. Neither party will agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation

  



        
   

  



  

or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party
and/or its outside counsel the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act.
Each party will provide to counsel for the other party copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each party may
withhold confidential and/or proprietary documents from the other party.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each party
will use its Reasonable Efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws. In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as a violation of any Antitrust Law, each party will cooperate and
use its Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal, unless by mutual agreement, the parties decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. In addition and
without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to take promptly any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-
United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
possible, including effecting or committing to effect, by consent decree,
hold separate orders, trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of such of
its assets or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order in any suit or
proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed
to require the Purchaser to commit to any undertaking, divestiture, license
or hold separate or similar arrangement or conduct of business arrangement or
to terminate any relationships, rights or obligations or to do any other act,
(i) to the extent such commitment, termination or action would be reasonably
likely to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition, or
prospects of the Business or the Purchaser Group, taken as a whole, or would
be likely to materially impair the expected benefits of the Contemplated
Transactions to the Purchaser, or (ii) in order to avoid a second request
and/or second phase instituted by a Governmental Entity under applicable
Antitrust Laws.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, the Purchaser and
the Seller each agree to prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
no later than the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of execution
and delivery of this Agreement (or such later date as may be mutually agreed
by the parties) all relevant notifications or reports for a joint filing
under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by
Section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the "
_Exon-Florio Amendment_ "), and to use Reasonable

  



        
   

  



  

Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain a
written notification issued by CFIUS that it has concluded a review of the
notification voluntarily provided and determined not to conduct a full
investigation or, if a full investigation is deemed to be required,
notification that the U.S. government will not take action to prevent the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Each party hereby covenants
(i) to promptly furnish to the other party hereto such necessary or
appropriate information and reasonable assistance, including access to
each others documents and personnel, as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary or voluntary filings
and other submissions, communications or presentations pursuant to the Exon-
Florio Amendment or any review or investigation thereto; (ii) to promptly
keep the other party apprised of the status of any communications with and
any inquiries by CFIUS; and (iii) to comply with a request for
additional information issued by CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity, as
the case may be, as promptly and expeditiously as practicable. The Purchaser
and the Seller each agree that they will not undertake any unilateral
contacts with CFIUS without the prior approval of the other party. If
any administrative, judicial or legislative action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any national security, foreign
investment or other applicable law, the Purchaser shall contest and
vigorously resist any such action or proceeding in order to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned as promptly and expeditiously as practicable
any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions by, including, pursuing all reasonable avenues of
administrative, executive, legislative or judicial appeal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.6(e)_, nothing in this Agreement
shall require or be construed to require the Purchaser to commit to any
conduct of business arrangement or to terminate any relationships, rights or
obligations or to do any other act, to the extent such commitment,
termination or action would be reasonably likely to be materially adverse to
the business, financial condition, or prospects of the Business or the
Purchaser Group, taken as a whole, or would be likely to materially impair
the expected benefits of the Contemplated Transactions to the Purchaser.

  



  

5.7 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement requiring a different standard of efforts or the
taking of specified actions, the parties agree to use Reasonable Efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the conditions precedent that are set
forth in _Article 6_, and the parties will use Reasonable Efforts to cause
the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated.

  



  

5.8 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by
the Acquired Companies or any member of the Seller Group with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions.

(a) The Seller and/or its Affiliates have provided certain corporate
guarantees (including bank guarantees and parent company guarantees) or
payment advances, or have obtained certain performance, bid, customs,
warranty, court or indemnity bonds and/or letters of credit or letters of
comfort, but specifically excluding any of the foregoing to the extent
delivered in connection with, or otherwise securing, any real property
obligation (such guarantees,

  



        
   

  



  

advances, bonds, letters of credit or letters of comfort, whether in
existence on the date hereof or provided or obtained after the date hereof,
the " _Seller Guarantees and Bonds_ ") in connection with the Business with
respect to which the Seller and/or its Affiliates (the " _Seller Guarantors_
") has reimbursement, indemnification or other obligations. _Schedule 5.9_

Date. With respect to any Seller Guarantees and Bonds that remain outstanding
after the Initial Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate
and shall use their Reasonable Efforts from and after the Initial Closing
Date until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Initial Closing
Date to cause the Purchaser or (if it is able to do so and in its sole
discretion) one of its Affiliates to replace such Seller Guarantees and
Bonds. Following the Initial Closing Date, to the extent such Seller
Guarantees and Bonds are listed on _Schedule 5.9_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or obtained after the date hereof in accordance with _Section 5.1_,
subject _mutatis mutandis_ to the claims procedure set forth in _Section
8.3_ (provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
8.3_, all notices to the Purchaser with respect to this _Section 5.9(b)_
shall be made by email notification to the Global Guarantee Center at
guarantees@nsn.com with a copy to Petri Castren at petri.castren@nsn.com

Schaumburg, Illinois becoming aware of any call or drawdown request on any
Seller Guarantee and Bond in excess of $1,000,000, it being understood that
no delay or deficiency on the part of the Seller in so notifying the
Purchaser will relieve the Purchaser of its indemnification and reimbursement
obligations under this _Section 5.9(b)_), the Purchaser agrees,
unconditionally and irrevocably, without right of setoff, to pay to,
reimburse, and indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Guarantors, for and
against all their Losses, payments, costs and expenses incurred after the
Initial Closing and relating to such Seller Guarantees and Bonds, which shall
be deemed to include all fees, expenses and other amounts payable under its
credit and bonding arrangements in respect of such Seller Guarantees
and Bonds, in each case until the complete and unconditional release of
the obligations of the Seller and its Affiliates with respect thereto. The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 8.5_. All such payments, reimbursements and indemnities by the
Purchaser shall be made within three (3) business days after receipt by it of
written notice by the Seller that it or one of its Affiliates has made or
incurred any such payment, cost or expense together with reasonable evidence
of such payment or incurrence.  To the extent that the Seller has performance
obligations under such Seller Guarantees and Bonds, the Purchaser shall use
Reasonable Efforts to (x) perform such obligations on behalf of the Seller or
(y) otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by the Seller so as to
put the Seller in the same position as if the Purchaser, and not the Seller,
had performed or were performing such obligations. The parties hereto agree
that the Seller will have no obligation to renew any Seller Guarantees or
Bonds issued on behalf of any Acquired Company after the expiration of any
such Seller Guarantee or Bond.

termination of this Agreement or the Initial Closing, the Seller shall, as
promptly as practicable, notify the Purchaser in writing (i) upon the Seller

occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause any Seller
Representation to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) in
the event the Seller reasonably believes that any condition to Closing set
forth in _Article 6_ cannot be satisfied. Except as otherwise set forth in
_Section 5.10(a)_, no disclosure by the Seller pursuant to this _Section
5.10(b)_, will be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure

misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant of the Seller
under this Agreement or any other Principal Agreement.

entertain or accept any proposal or offer from any Person (other than the

provide the Purchaser Group with certain products related to businesses of
the Seller Group other than the

  



        
   

  



  

Business, including with respect to the commercial arrangements described on
_Schedule 5.12_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

of its Affiliates to) use its best efforts to ensure that the credit

fully fund the Purchase Price on the Initial Closing Date.  The Purchaser

to such Purchaser Facility Agreement and (b) any written notice received by
it or any Affiliate which could reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the Purchasers ability to finance the Contemplated Transactions.

Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(ix) _No Material Adverse Effect_. No Material Adverse Effect on the
Business shall have occurred since the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Conditions to Additional Closings_. The obligations of the Purchaser to

following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by the
Purchaser, but only in a writing signed by the Purchaser:

  



  

(i) _No Litigation_. No judgment, writ or order of any Governmental Entity or
other legal restraint or prohibition may be in effect that in any case would
prevent the Contemplated Transactions to be the subject of each such
Additional Closing.

  



  

(ii) _Government Approvals_. All filings with, and consents and approvals of,
applicable Governmental Entities pursuant to Antitrust Laws to be made and/or
obtained (as agreed by the parties pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ ) must have

such Additional Closing.

  



  

(iii) _Other Transaction Agreements and Related Instruments_. The Seller

 **ARTICLE 7 
 TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT**

  



  

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Initial Closing:

  



  

(a) By mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

  



  

(b) By the Seller, if the Purchaser shall have breached any representation or
warranty or failed to comply with any covenant or agreement applicable to the
Purchaser that would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; provided, however, that
the Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(c) By the Purchaser, if the Seller shall have breached any representation or
warranty or failed to comply with any covenant or agreement applicable to the
Purchaser that would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 6.2(a)(ii)_ not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; provided, however, that
the Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(d) By either the Purchaser or the Seller for any reason if the Initial
Closing has not occurred on or before the close of business on April 30, 2011
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by
the parties, or such later date as the parties may agree in writing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party cannot terminate this Agreement under
this provision if the failure of the Initial Closing to occur is primarily
the result of the failure on the part of such party to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or under any other Principal Agreement (except the
failure on the part of such party to satisfy a closing condition over which
such party has no control); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Termination
Date will be extended for an additional period to the extent necessary for
either party, as applicable, to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.1(a)(v)_ or _6.2(a)(v)_ , as applicable (except in circumstances
contemplated by _subsection (c)_ hereof), but with a maximum extension of
one hundred twenty (120) days;

  



  

(e) By either the Purchaser or the Seller if any Governmental Entity has
issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction, decree or ruling or taken
any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision
will not be available to any party whose failure to comply with its
obligations contained in this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, such order, injunction, decree or ruling;

  



  

(f) by the Seller, on or after the 45th day after notice to the Purchaser that
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ and _Section 6.2(a)_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Initial Closing) and the Initial Closing should have
occurred in accordance with _Section 2.2_, if the Initial Closing shall
not have occurred because the Purchaser shall have failed to comply with
its obligations to consummate the Initial Closing; or

  



  

(g) by the Purchaser, on or after the 45th day after notice to the Seller that
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ and _Section 6.2(a)_ have
been satisfied (other than those

  



        
   

  



  

conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Initial Closing)
and the Initial Closing should have occurred in accordance with _Section 2.2_
, if the Initial Closing shall not have occurred because the Seller shall
have failed to comply with its obligations to consummate the Initial Closing.

  



  

Any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
7.1_ shall become effective by the delivery of written notice by the
terminating party to the other party. Each of the Principal Agreements will
automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement without any
further action by either party.

  



  

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with this _Article 7_, this Agreement and the rights
and obligations of the parties under this Agreement automatically end without
any Liability against any party or its Affiliates, except that nothing in
this _Section 7.2_ relieves any party from Liability for the breach of any
provisions of this Agreement prior to termination, and the provisions of
_Section 5.5_ [ _Confidentiality_ ], this _Section 7.2_,  _Section 7.3_ [
_Nonexclusivity of Termination Rights_ ], and _Article 11_ [ _Miscellaneous_
] will remain in force and survive any termination of this Agreement.  If
the Purchaser or the Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to this
_Article 7_, the Purchaser will comply with the NDA regarding the return
and/or destruction of any documents furnished to the other party
in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

7.3 _Nonexclusivity of Termination Rights_. The termination rights provided in
_Section 7.1_ will not be deemed to be exclusive.  Accordingly, the
exercise by any party of its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ will not be deemed to be an election of remedies and will not
be deemed to prejudice, or to constitute or operate as a waiver of, any other
right or remedy that such party may be entitled to exercise (whether under
this Agreement, under any other Contract, under any statute, rule or other
laws, at common law, in equity or otherwise).

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8 
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

8.1 _Indemnification by the Seller_. From and after the Initial Closing,
and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in _Section 8.5_
hereof, the Seller will, during the Indemnification Period, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser and its stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_
") from and against any and all Losses (other than Losses with respect to
Taxes, for which the provisions of _Section 9.1(a)_ will govern)
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from the
following:

  



  

(a) any failure of any Seller Representation to be true and correct on and as
of the Initial Closing Date (or with respect to representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date, the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such date);

  



        
   

  



  

(b) other than with respect to the covenant obligations in _Section
5.10(b)_, any failure of the Seller to duly perform any covenant or agreement
to be performed by the Seller pursuant to any of the Principal Agreements;

  



  

(c) any Excluded Liability (whether arising prior to or after the Initial
Closing Date).

  



  

8.2 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. From and after the Initial Closing,
and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in _Section 8.5_ hereof,
the Purchaser will, during the Indemnification Period, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Seller and its stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses (other than Losses with
respect to Taxes, for which the provisions of _Section 9.1(b)_ will
govern) incurred by the Seller Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from
the following:

  



  

(a) any failure of any Purchaser Representation to be true and correct on and
as of the Initial Closing Date (or with respect to representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date, the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such date);

  



  

(b) any failure of the Purchaser to duly perform any covenant or agreement to
be performed by the Purchaser pursuant to any of the Principal Agreements;

  



  

(c) without limiting the rights of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)_, any Assumed Liability (whether arising prior to or after the Initial
Closing Date); and

  



  

(d) any claim or cause of action by any Person arising after the Initial
Closing Date against any Seller Indemnitee with respect to the Purchasers
operation of the Business following the Initial Closing.

  



  

8.3 _Claim Procedure_.

  



  

(a) _Claim Notice_. A party which seeks indemnity under this _Article 8_ or
_Article 9_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will give prompt written notice of
any pending or threatened claim, demand or circumstance that the Indemnified
Party has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ").
The Claim Notice must contain (i) a description and, if known, estimated
amount (the " _Claimed Amount_ ") of any Losses incurred or reasonably
expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonable
explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of facts then
known by the Indemnified Party (including any supporting documents required
by _Section 8.3(d)_), and (iii) a demand for payment of those Losses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article 8_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure, it being understood that notices for claims in respect of a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered
prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in
_Section 8.4_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Response to Notice of Claim_.  Within sixty (60) days after delivery of
a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party
a written response (the " _Response_ ") in which the Indemnifying Party will
agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, and, within ten (10) business days of the Indemnified Partys receipt
of the Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If no Response is delivered
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within such sixty (60)-day
period, the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have disputed that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount.

  



  

(c) _Contested Claims_. In the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes (or
is deemed to have disputed) the Claimed Amount, such dispute will be governed
by, and subject to the terms of, _Section 11.1_ hereof.

  



  

(d) _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(i) In the event that the Indemnified Party receives notice or
otherwise learns of the assertion by a Person other than a Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee of any claim, suit, audit or other proceeding
(including any Tax Contest) with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may
be obligated to provide indemnification under this _Article 8_ or _Article 9_
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will provide a Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable but in no event later
than ten (10) business days thereafter. Such Claim Notice will be
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such
third party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified Party)
and will describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for
such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and the amount of the claimed damages
(in each case to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the
Indemnified Party); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no delay or deficiency on
the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle
with respect to such Third Party Claim is actually prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(ii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification pursuant to
_Section 8.3(d)(i)_, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such claim, suit, audit
or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
strictly at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  If the
Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party will control such defense. All recovery of any attorney
fees, court costs and similar expenses as a result of any such claim, audit
or proceeding shall belong solely to the party controlling such defense.

  



  

(iii) The party not controlling such defense (the " _Non-controlling Party_
") may participate therein at its own expense, subject to any limitations
that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege or third
party confidentiality obligation. The party controlling such defense (the "
_Controlling Party_ ") shall select

  



        
   

  



  

counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence
and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Controlling Party will keep the Non-controlling Party
reasonably advised of the status of such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and
the defense thereof (subject to any limitations that are reasonably required
to preserve any applicable privilege or third party confidentiality
obligation) and will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-
controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party will furnish
the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to
such claim, suit, audit or proceeding (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any
written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and assist the
Controlling Party in the defense of such claim, suit, audit or proceeding.

  



  

(iv) The Indemnifying Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to
agree) to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such claim, suit, audit or proceeding without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that the consent of the Indemnified
Party will not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay
any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such
settlement or judgment includes a full, complete and unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from further Liability with respect to such claim. The
Indemnified Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to agree) to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim,
suit, audit or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not encumber any of
the material assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or
condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified
Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business; _provided_
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
8.3(d)_, the Seller shall not agree to any settlement or other disposition
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Tax Contest without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement or disposition could
reasonably be expected to increase the amount of Taxes (other than Excluded
Taxes) imposed on any Acquired Company or the Purchaser or the amount of
Transfer Taxes or VAT.

  



  

8.4 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants;
Indemnification Period_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in any Principal Agreement (including the Seller
Representations) shall (I) survive the Initial Closing solely for purposes of
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_  and (II) expire as follows (the period from the
Initial Closing Date through the relevant expiration date being referred to
as the " _Indemnification Period_ " in this Agreement):

  



  

(a) the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in _Section
3.2_ [ _Capitalization; Ownership_ ], _Section 3.3_ [ _Authorization_ ], and
the first sentence of _Section 3.7_ [ _Assets_ ] of this Agreement, and of
the Purchaser set forth in  _Section 4.2_ [ _Authorization_ ] of this
Agreement, will survive until the latest date permitted by law;

  



        
   

  



  

(b) the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in _Section
3.6_ [ _Tax Matters_ ] of this Agreement, and the Sellers covenant to pay
Taxes pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ of this Agreement, will survive
the Initial Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions or waivers thereof);

  



  

(c) the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in _Section
3.15_ [ _Environmental Matters_ ] of this Agreement will survive the Initial
Closing and expire on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Initial Closing
Date;

  



  

(d) all other Seller Representations and Purchaser Representations will
survive the Initial Closing and expire eighteen (18) months following the
Initial Closing Date; and

  



  

(e) all other covenants and agreements of the parties contained in any
Principal Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant
thereto or in connection therewith will survive the Initial Closing until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extension
or tolling thereof) or for the shorter period explicitly specified therein,
except that for such covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter
period, breaches thereof will survive indefinitely until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extension or tolling
thereof).

  



  

If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration
of the applicable Indemnification Period, either a Claim Notice based on the
fact that an Indemnified Party has incurred Losses, or a notice that, as a
result of a legal proceeding instituted by or claim made by a third Person,
the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur Losses (an " _Expected
Claim Notice_ "), then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement will survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of
the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim
with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party will promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

8.5 _Limitations_.

  



  

(a) _Liability of the Seller and Purchaser_.

  



  

(i) Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall be required to
provide indemnification to the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, under _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.2(a)_ to the
extent the amount of Losses paid, respectively, with respect thereto would
exceed Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000).  Other than with respect
to Losses incurred in connection with the Excluded Liabilities described in
_Sections 1.4(g)_ and _1.4(h)_ , the Sellers aggregate Liability for all
Losses under this Agreement (whether under this _Article 8_, _Article 9_ or
otherwise) and the other Transaction Agreements will in no event exceed the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(ii) The Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, will
not be entitled to any indemnification payment for Losses arising under
_Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_ or for Non-Income Tax Claims unless and
until such time

  



        
   

  



  

as the total amount of Losses that have been incurred by any one or more of
the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees under _Section 8.1(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(a)_ or for Non-Income Tax Claims exceeds Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ "). If the total amount of such Losses
exceeds the Deductible, then the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, as applicable, will be entitled to be indemnified only for
amounts in excess of the Deductible.

  



  

(iii) For purposes of this _Article 8_ and without limiting the effect of
any other limitation contained in this _Article 8_ , (A) no Seller
Representation is deemed to be or have been inaccurate if the Purchaser had
actual knowledge of such inaccuracy as of the date of this Agreement, and (B)
no Purchaser Representation is deemed to be or have been inaccurate if the
Seller had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the party asserting that the other
party had knowledge shall have the burden of proving such knowledge. Subject
to _Section 5.10(a)_ , (x) no investigation by the Purchaser or the Seller
following the date hereof shall affect the Seller Representations and the
Purchaser Representations, respectively, and (y) such Seller Representations
and Purchaser Representations shall not be affected or deemed waived by
reason of the fact that the Purchaser or the Seller, respectively, learned
after the date hereof that any of the same is or might be inaccurate in any
respect.

  



  

(b) _Other Limitations_.

  



  

(i) The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is
provided pursuant to this _Article 8_ or _Article 9_ will be net of any
Tax Benefit to which an Indemnified Party is entitled by reason of payment of
such Liability (taking into account any Tax cost or reduction in such
Tax Benefits by reason of receipt of the indemnification payment) and any
amounts of any credits, discounts, insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, contribution payments or reimbursements to the extent actually
received by, or paid in kind to, the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.  In connection
therewith, if, at any time following payment in full by the Indemnifying
Party of any amounts of Losses due hereunder, the Indemnified Party receives
any credits, discounts, insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements relating to the circumstances giving
rise to such Losses, the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party such credits, discounts, proceeds, payments
or reimbursements in an amount not to exceed the amount of the
corresponding indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliate has been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnification obligations to
the extent that any Indemnified Party affirmatively causes or contributes to,
or knowingly fails to take actions that causes or contributes to, the
conditions giving rise to any indemnifiable Losses; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this limitation on the Indemnifying Partys

  



        
   

  



  

indemnification obligations shall apply only to the extent of the Indemnified
Partys cause or contribution to the Loss. For the avoidance of doubt, with
regard to environmental matters, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Seller shall not be responsible for any Losses to the
extent that such Losses are (A) caused or exacerbated by (1) voluntary
disclosure to a Governmental Entity (that is not required by applicable
Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits), (2) a post-Initial Closing
release of Hazardous Material by the Purchaser, another member of the
Purchaser Group, an Acquired Company or a Joint Venture (or any successors or
assigns of any of the foregoing) or (3) a post-Initial Closing violation of
Environmental Law, or (B) discovered as the result of any sampling of air,
surface water, groundwater, soil or other media by or on behalf of
the Purchaser, another member of the Purchaser Group, an Acquired Company or
a Joint Venture (or any successors or assigns of any of the foregoing),
unless such sampling is (1) required by applicable Environmental Law, (2)
a response to a material threat to human health or the environment or (3)
conducted in connection with any expansion of a facility, provided that, the
Purchaser shall provide prior written notice to the Seller of any sampling
pursuant to (B)(1) or (B)(3) above and afford the Seller the opportunity to
be present at the site at the time of such sampling, and provided further
that the Purchaser shall notify the Seller of any sampling required pursuant
to (B)(2) above as promptly as possible thereafter and afford the Seller the
opportunity to be present at the site at the time of any future related
sampling; _provided_ ,  _further_ , however that failure to provide such
notice to the Seller shall not relieve the Seller of any liability hereunder
except to the extent the Seller is actually prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(iii) The amount of any Losses claimed by any Purchaser Indemnitee
hereunder shall be reduced to the extent that the Purchaser shall have
received the benefit of an adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.5_ due to the
fact that the item that is the subject of the indemnification claim was
specifically taken into account in the Final Closing Date Statement of Net
Assets or the Malaysia Final Closing Statement as finally determined.

  



  

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Initial Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any and all Losses arising in connection
with the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
the Principal Agreements will be pursuant to the indemnification obligations
set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 9.1(a)_. Except as contemplated in
this _Article 8_  and _Article 9_ of this Agreement, the Seller will not have
any Liability under any Principal Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing will not prohibit the Purchaser from seeking injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or
to specifically enforce the Principal Agreements or any of the terms or
provisions thereof.

  



  

(b) From and after the Initial Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Seller Indemnitee with respect to any and all Losses arising in connection
with the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
the Principal Agreements will be pursuant to the indemnification obligations
set forth in _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.1(b)_. Except as contemplated in
this _Article 8_  and _Article 9_ of this Agreement, the Purchaser will not
have any

  



        
   

  



  

Liability under any Principal Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing will not prohibit the Seller from seeking injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to
specifically enforce the Principal Agreements or any of the terms or
provisions thereof.

  



  

8.7 _Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties_. No Purchaser
Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor or assignee of the
Purchaser) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this
Agreement unless the Purchaser (or any successor or assignee of the
Purchaser) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim. No
Seller Indemnitee (other than the Seller or any successor or assignee of the
Seller) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this Agreement
unless the Seller (or any successor or assignee of the Seller) consents to
the assertion of the indemnification claim.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 9**

  

 **TAX MATTERS**

  



  

9.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes_.

  



  

(a) The Seller will indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against (i) all
Excluded Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes of any Joint Venture) and any
reasonable costs and expenses related thereto incurred by Tax advisors of the
Purchaser Indemnitees in connection with defending the assessment of any
Excluded Tax (other than Excluded Taxes of any Joint Venture) during the
course of any audit or other proceedings initiated by a Governmental Entity;
and (ii) all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of or
resulting from a breach of any representation or warranty in _Section
3.6_ with respect to Excluded Taxes of any Joint Venture. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the amount of Losses against which the Seller is required to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to clause (ii) shall be limited
to the amount by which (x) the value of the equity interests in such Joint
Venture that are either acquired pursuant to this Agreement or held by any
Acquired Company as of the Closing Date is reduced (but not below zero) by
(y) the amount of Excluded Taxes of such Joint Venture. In addition, the
Seller shall only be liable under this _Section 9.1(a)_ for Losses resulting
from a breach of a representation or warranty in _Section 3.6_ with respect
to Hangzhou JV to the extent such Losses (as computed pursuant to the
immediately prior sentence) exceed the Sellers pro rata portion of all cash
held by Hangzhou JV immediately prior to the Closing with respect to Hangzhou
JV.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against (i) all Taxes
imposed against the Seller that are attributable to the Purchaser Groups
conduct of the Business or use of the Acquired Assets, or the activities of
any Acquired Company, during any Post-Closing Period, (ii) any Taxes
resulting from the breach of any covenant or other obligation of
the Purchaser under this _Article 9_, and (iii) any Taxes of, or relating
to, the Business or the Acquired Companies or the other Acquired Assets
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Ventures) that are
not Excluded Taxes. Any Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnity under this
_Article 9_ will comply with the claims procedure set forth in _Section
8.3_.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Straddle Period, Taxes will be allocated between the
portion of the period ending on the Initial Closing Date and the portion of
the period beginning

  



         
 

  



  

on the day after the Initial Closing Date by closing the books at the end of
the Initial Closing Date, except that (i) Tax items of a periodic nature
or measured by the level of any item, such as real and personal ad
valorem property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") and depreciation allowances
calculated on an annual or periodic basis, will be allocated by apportioning
a pro-rata portion of such Taxes to each day in the relevant Straddle Period
and (ii) Tax items resulting from activities or transactions on the Initial
Closing Date, but after the Initial Closing, that are not in the Ordinary
Course will be treated as occurring on the day after the Initial Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any Property Taxes imposed on the Acquired
Assets shall be prorated in accordance with the methodology set forth in
_Section 10.10(a)(i)_.

  



  

(d) Any applicable sales, use, transfer, stamp, stock transfer or similar
Taxes that are, or become due and payable as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, whether such Taxes are imposed by law on the Acquired
Companies, the other Acquired Assets, the Seller Group or the Purchaser Group
(such Taxes, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), will be borne equally by the
Purchaser and the Seller.  Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall
coordinate the payment of its respective portion of any Transfer Taxes to the
applicable Governmental Entity (and, as applicable, shall provide to the
other party reasonable evidence of such payment) on or prior to the date such
Transfer Taxes are due. The parties will cooperate with each other
in minimizing the amount of any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted
by applicable law (including the provision of any information or preparation
of any documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any
available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any such Transfer Taxes).
Any Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to any Transfer
Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party that customarily has primary
responsibility for filing such Tax Returns pursuant to the applicable law.
Any party failing to pay its portion of any Transfer Taxes in accordance with
the terms hereof and in a timely manner shall be responsible for any fees,
penalties or other expenses to the extent resulting therefrom. The amount of
any payment for a supply of goods or services or the value of any supply made
or deemed to have been made pursuant to any Principal Agreement will be
exclusive of any VAT properly chargeable on the supply. The amount of any such
VAT will be borne (x) to the extent such VAT is non-recoverable, equally by
the Purchaser and the Seller, and (y) to the extent such VAT is recoverable,
solely by the Purchaser in addition to any payment due under any Principal
Agreement at the time the supply is made. In the event that any VAT is
imposed upon or imposed against any member of the Seller Group, the Seller
will promptly notify the Purchaser of the VAT amount on a valid VAT invoice.
Upon receipt thereof, the Purchaser will promptly remit to the Seller the
amount specified in such VAT invoice, and the Seller will make, or will cause
to be made, any payments to the applicable Governmental Entities as required
under applicable law. The parties will cooperate with each other in the
provision of any information or preparation of any documentation that may be
necessary or useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction
or exemption of VAT or for seeking a refund or credit of VAT. Any Tax Returns
that are required to be filed with respect to VAT will be prepared and filed
by the party that customarily has primary responsibility for filing such Tax
Return pursuant to the applicable law.

  



  

(e) All obligations of the Seller under this _Section 9.1_ shall represent
the sole and exclusive indemnity obligation for Taxes and all of the Sellers
obligations for Taxes under this _Section 9.1_ shall be subject to the
limitations provided for in _Section 8.5_.

  



        
   

  



  

9.2 _Withholding Taxes_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase
Price or any other payment made or deemed to have been made pursuant to any
of the Transaction Agreements such amounts as the Purchaser is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law with respect to the making of such payment. All amounts
properly withheld and deducted shall be treated as paid to the applicable
recipient to the extent that such amounts are properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

  



  

(b) To the extent the Purchaser believes that it is required to deduct or
withhold from the Purchase Price or any payment made or deemed to have been
made pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, the Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with timely notice of its intent to withhold, the amount it believes
it is required to withhold, and the legal basis for the withholding
requirement. To the extent the Seller timely raises any objections to the
requirement to withhold (or determination of the amount of withholding), the
Purchaser shall work in good faith with the Seller to resolve any differences
as to the requirement to withhold and the amount of required withholding.

  



  

9.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) The Seller will prepare an allocation statement allocating the Purchase
Price (including for purposes of this _Section 9.3_, any other value to the
Seller for Income Tax purposes, including the relevant portion of Assumed
Liabilities (the " _Enterprise Value_ ")) among the Acquired Assets
(including the Acquired Company Shares and the JV Interests not owned by an
Acquired Company) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_ "). The Proposed
Allocation Statement will be sent to the Purchaser within ninety (90)
business days following the Initial Closing Date. Within thirty
(30) business days after the receipt of the Proposed Allocation Statement,
the Purchaser will propose any changes or will indicate its
concurrence therewith. In the event that the Purchaser does not concur with
the Proposed Allocation Statement, the Purchaser and the Seller will attempt
to reach agreement on the allocation of the Enterprise Value among the
Acquired Assets in a manner consistent with applicable Income Tax law.

  



  

(i) If the Purchaser and the Seller reach agreement on such allocation (an "
_Agreed Allocation_ "), the Purchaser and the Seller will, and will cause
each applicable Affiliate to: (A) file all Tax Returns for Income
Taxes consistent therewith; (B) promptly inform each other of any challenge
by any Governmental Entity to the Agreed Allocation; and (C) consult with
and keep one another informed with respect to the status of, and any
discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any challenge to the
Agreed Allocation.

  



  

(ii) If the Purchaser and the Seller do not reach an Agreed Allocation within
six (6) months after the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Seller
will each prepare its own allocation of the Enterprise Value among the
Acquired Assets (including the Acquired Company Shares) to be used by
such party and its Affiliates.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) For the purposes of this _Section 9.3_, any payments made pursuant to
_Article 8_ or _9_ hereof will be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price and the parties shall make appropriate adjustments to any allocation
(whether or not an Agreed Allocation) to reflect any adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but solely to the extent the Purchaser and
the Seller are required by applicable law to agree on the amount or value of
a particular Acquired Asset for purposes of any Transfer Taxes, the Purchaser
and the Seller will mutually agree on a good faith estimate of the fair
market value of such asset prior to the date any Transfer Tax filing is
required to be made or any such Transfer Tax payment is required to be paid
(including applicable extensions).  The Purchaser and the Seller understand
and agree that any agreement reached pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)_ is
reached solely for purposes of Transfer Tax filings and payments required
under applicable law, and will in no way be regarded by the parties as
conclusive with respect to the allocation described in _Section 9.3(a)_
unless required under applicable law.

  



  

9.4 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any interest paid or
credit with respect thereto) (a " _Tax Refund_ ") relating to Excluded Taxes
(or that is otherwise an Excluded Asset) or for a Tax that is reserved for on
the Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets, or Taxes that the Seller is
responsible for pursuant to _Section 10.11_ will be the property of the
Seller, and if received by the Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of
their Affiliates, will be paid over promptly to the Seller. Any Tax Refund
relating to Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes or Taxes reserved on the Final
Closing Date Statement of Net Assets or relating to Taxes the Seller is
responsible for pursuant to _Section 10.10_) will be the property of the
Purchaser, and if received by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, will be
paid over promptly to the Purchaser.

  



  

(b) With respect to any Tax Refund to which either the Seller or the
Purchaser is entitled pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ (the " _Refund Recipient_
"), (i) at the request of the Refund Recipient, the other party (the "
_Refund Payor_ ") shall file (or cause its relevant Affiliate to file) for
such Tax Refund; and (ii) any payment to the Refund Recipient shall be net of
any additional amounts of Taxes that are imposed on the Refund Payor or any
of its Affiliates as a result of the Refund Payor or any of its Affiliates
filing for and obtaining such Tax Refund.

  



  

(c) If any Joint Venture receives a Tax Refund relating to Excluded Taxes or
for a Tax that is reserved for on the Final Closing Date Statement of Net
Assets, the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller an amount equal to the
amount by which the value of the equity interests in such Joint Venture that
are either acquired pursuant to this Agreement or held by any Acquired
Company as of the Closing Date is increased above zero as a result of such
Joint Venture receiving such Tax Refund.

  



  

9.5 _Cooperation_. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agree that it will
(and will cause its respective Affiliates to):

  



  

(a) Provide assistance to the other party as reasonably requested in
preparing and filing Tax Returns, responding to Tax Contests, and recovering
any VAT or Transfer Tax, in

  



        
   

  



  

each case, relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Companies, the Joint
Ventures, the other Acquired Assets, or the Business;

  



  

(b) Make available to the other party as reasonably requested all
information, records and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired
Companies, the Joint Ventures, the Acquired Assets and the Business
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any information, records
and documents relating to potentially available scientific research
and experimental development or other similar Tax credits under applicable
law with respect to the Acquired Companies, the Joint Ventures, the Acquired
Assets and the Business (" _Technical Records_ ");

  



  

(c) Retain any Tax Returns and other books and records (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Technical Records) that could reasonably be expected
to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation or filing by any
other party of any Tax Returns concerning the Acquired Companies, the Joint
Ventures, the other Acquired Assets or the Business (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, obtaining any scientific research and experimental
development or other similar Tax credit under applicable law with respect to
the Acquired Companies, the Joint Ventures, the Acquired Assets or the
Business), or any Tax Contest or other examination or proceeding relating to
Taxes concerning the Acquired Companies, the Joint Ventures, the other
Acquired Assets or the Business.  Such books and records will be retained
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions thereof);

  



  

(d) Execute any powers of attorney or other documents that will allow an
Indemnifying Party to take control of a Tax Contest as contemplated by
_Section 8.3_.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 9.5_ shall require that any party retain any
Technical Records that would not be retained in its normal course of business
(or as necessary to comply with applicable Tax laws) or to provide Technical
Records in any form that is materially different than in the form the
Technical Records are maintained by such party.

  



  

9.6 _Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies_.

  



  

(a) The Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of, or with respect
to, any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Period (collectively, " _Seller
Prepared Returns_ "). All Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with applicable law and on a basis consistent with
current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of the Seller and the
Acquired Companies. Subject to _Section 9.6(b)_, the Seller shall submit a
draft of each Seller Prepared Return to the Purchaser for Purchasers review
and comment no later than twenty (20) days before the date such Seller
Prepared Return is required to be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity
(after taking into account applicable extensions). The Purchaser shall have
ten (10) days after the date of receipt thereof to submit to the Seller, in
writing, the Purchasers comments with respect to any Seller Prepared Return
provided pursuant to this _Section 9.6(a)_.  The Seller shall incorporate
any reasonable comments made by the Purchaser into any Seller Prepared Return
provided pursuant to this _Section 9.6(a)_ prior to filing of such Seller
Prepared Return.  To the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser disagree
with respect to any of the

  



        
   

  



  

Purchasers comments, the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly negotiate
in good faith to resolve such disagreement prior to the date such Seller
Prepared Return is required to be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity
(after taking into account applicable extensions). To the extent a Seller
Prepared Return provided pursuant to this _Section 9.6(a)_ needs to be filed
by the Acquired Company, the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company to
timely file such Tax Return in the form prepared by Seller (as adjusted to
reflect the reasonable comments of Purchaser).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 9.6(a)_, the
Purchaser shall not be entitled to review and comment on any Tax Return
of the Seller, its Affiliates or any combined, consolidated or unitary group
that includes the Seller or any Affiliate (including the U.S. federal income
Tax Return that includes the Seller); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
the Seller shall prepare and submit to the Purchaser, no later than twenty
(20) days before the due date (after taking into account applicable
extensions) of the Sellers U.S. federal income Tax Return for the taxable
year including the Initial Closing Date, a pro forma draft of the U.S.
federal income Tax Return for such taxable year of each relevant Acquired
Company; (ii) the Purchaser shall have ten (10) days after the date of
receipt thereof to submit to the Seller, in writing, the Purchasers comments
with respect to such pro forma Tax Returns; and (iii) the Seller shall
consult with the Purchaser in good faith to incorporate any reasonable
comments made by the Purchaser regarding incorporating the pro forma Tax
Return into the Sellers U.S. federal income Tax Return for such taxable year
prior to the filing of such Tax Return.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies other than Seller Prepared Returns (collectively, "
_Purchaser Prepared Returns_ "). All Purchaser Prepared Returns that relate
to a Straddle Period shall (to the extent permitted under applicable law)
be prepared on a basis consistent with current practices, procedures and
accounting methods.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser shall not allow any Acquired Company to file an amended Tax
Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, or extend the
applicable statute of limitations for any Excluded Taxes, without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

9.7 _Activities on the Closing Date; No Section 338 Election_. The Purchaser
shall not engage in any activities or transactions with any Acquired Asset
(or allow any Acquired Company to engage in any activities or transactions)
on the Initial Closing Date that are not in the Ordinary Course, and any
Taxes resulting from such activities or transactions shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as being incurred in a Post-Closing Period.
 Neither party will make an election under Section 338 of the Code with
respect to the acquisition of any Acquired Company or Joint Venture as part
of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

9.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements between the
Seller and its Affiliates shall be cancelled (or appropriately amended) so
that no Acquired Company has any rights or obligations thereunder after the
Initial Closing.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 10**

  

 **OTHER AGREEMENTS**

  



  

10.1 _Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions herein, prior to and following the Initial
Closing, each party agrees to (i) cooperate fully with the other party and to
execute such further instruments, documents and agreements, and to give such
further written assurances, as may be reasonably requested by any other party
to evidence and reflect better the Contemplated Transactions and to carry
into effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement and (ii) use their
Reasonable Efforts before and after the Initial Closing Date to take or cause
to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Contemplated Transactions,
including, in the case of the Purchaser, by entering into such foreign
exchange hedging instruments as the Purchaser shall reasonably
deem necessary. In connection therewith, each party agrees to comply, and
will cause its applicable Affiliates to comply, with its respective pre-
Closing commitments, obligations and covenants under the other Transaction
Agreements.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, with reference to the Transition Services
Agreement, each party agrees that, from the date hereof through the Initial
Closing, it will cooperate fully with the other party in further developing
Annexes A and B of the Transition Services Agreement and identifying and
agreeing in good faith upon the additional Transition Services (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) and the details thereof to be set forth on
the Annexes thereto in respect of such Transition Services as reasonably
necessary for the transfer of the Business to the Purchaser Group. Except as
set forth on the Annexes to the Transition Services Agreement, the Transition
Services will be limited to those services performed for the Business
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement unless specifically, and on a
case-by-case basis, agreed to by the Seller. The parties shall
use Reasonable Efforts to finalize the Annexes to the Transition Services
Agreement within ninety (90) days from the date of this Agreement, but in any
event shall finalize the Annexes to the Transition Services Agreement no
later than the Initial Closing. In the event that the parties are unable to
agree upon finalized Annexes by the Initial Closing, the Seller shall at a
minimum provide (i) the Transition Services set forth on  _Schedule
10.1(b)-1_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) such other services
provided for the Business as of the date of this Agreement, other than such
services set forth on _Schedule 10.1(b)-2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
and unless otherwise prohibited by law, at the service levels, volume and
costs associated with such services as at the date of this Agreement, all in
accordance with the provisions of the Transition Services Agreement. As the
Annexes to the Transition Services are developed and finalized by the parties
prior to the Initial Closing, in the event the parties believe the
performance by the Seller Group, or receipt by the Purchaser Group, of a
particular Transition Service could result in the creation of Intellectual
Property, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith at such time regarding
the ownership and use rights associated with such Intellectual Property.

  



  

(c) Following the Initial Closing, each party shall not, and shall cause the
other members of the Purchaser Group and the Seller Group, as applicable, and
their respective

  



        
   

  



  

Affiliates, not to, take any action (or fail to take any action) with respect
to a customer of the Business that is reasonably likely to impair or
prejudice the Sellers, MCCs or the Purchasers (or any of their respective
Affiliates) ability, as applicable, to receive timely payment on all amounts
owed under the MCC Notes, the Litigation Related Receivables, the Excluded
Accounts Receivable, or any receivables under any MCC Financing Contract
assumed by the Purchaser; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no actions taken by
the parties and their Affiliates to pursue collection of amounts due and
owing in accordance with the terms of any agreement with such customer,
including the instigation of litigation, shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 10.1(c)_.

  



  

10.2 _Wrong Pocket_. Subject to _Section 2.2(c)_ and  _Section 2.2(d)_, in
the event that any member of the Seller Group receives any payment related to
any Acquired Asset after the Initial Closing, the Seller agrees to promptly
remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to the Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Accounts
Receivable received in a lock box of the Seller Group shall be retained for
the account of the Seller as an Excluded Asset and shall not be remitted to
the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies)
receives any payment related to any Excluded Asset after the Initial Closing,
including any Excluded Accounts Receivable, the Purchaser agrees to promptly
remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to the Seller. In the
event that any cash held by the Seller Group in a Transferred Account, or any
cash held in a bank account of an Acquired Company, is not transferred
or distributed out of such account by the Seller Group or the Acquired
Company prior to the Initial Closing, the Purchaser agrees to promptly remit
(or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to the Seller.

  



  

10.3 _Cooperation; Records and Documents_.

  



  

(a) In the event and for so long as either party (the " _Contesting Party_ ")
is actively contesting, defending against, or undertaking any activity or
internal investigation in preparation for or that may be expected to result
in any Legal Proceeding (whether or not such Legal Proceeding is an Existing
Litigation Matter) in connection with or related to (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction on
or prior to the Initial Closing Date involving the Business, the other party
shall (x) cooperate with the Contesting Party and its counsel in the contest,
defense, or internal investigation, (y) make available its personnel, and (z)
provide such testimony and access to its books and records, in each case as
may be necessary in connection with the contest, defense, or investigation,
at the sole cost and expense of the Contesting Party (unless the Contesting
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article 8_).  The
parties further agree that any such contest, defense, or
internal investigation related to an indemnification claim under _Article
8_ or _Article 9_ shall be treated as a Third Party Claim after the Initial
Closing Date, even if first brought to the attention of the Seller or the
Purchaser by a source other than a third party. The provisions of this
_Section 10.3(a)_ shall not be applicable in the case of any Legal
Proceeding by one party to this Agreement against the other.

  



  

(b) Following the Initial Closing Date, the Seller shall grant to the
Purchaser and its representatives, at the Purchasers reasonable request
(subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any
applicable privilege or third party confidentiality obligation),

  



        
   

  



  

reasonable access during normal business hours and under reasonable
circumstances to, and the right to make copies at Purchasers sole expense
of, those records and documents in the Sellers possession related to the
Business, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities as may be reasonably necessary for the Purchasers operation of
the Business after the Initial Closing. Following the Initial Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall grant to the Seller and its representatives, at
the Sellers reasonable request (subject to any limitations that are
reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege or third party
confidentiality obligation), access during normal business hours and under
reasonable circumstances to, and the right to make copies at the Sellers
sole expense of, those records and documents covering any period prior to the
Initial Closing related to the Business, the Acquired Companies or the
Acquired Assets as may be reasonably necessary for litigation, preparation of
financial statements, tax returns and audits or other valid business
purposes. If the Purchaser elects to dispose of any of such records within
six (6) years after the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser shall first give
the Seller sixty (60) days written notice, during which period the Seller
shall have the right to take such records without payment of consideration.
If so requested by either the Seller or the Purchaser, the other party shall
enter into a customary joint defense agreement with the Seller or the
Purchaser with respect to any information to be provided to such party
pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_. All rights of access to information
and documents granted under this _Section 10.3_ are subject to restrictions
on access to classified facilities and information imposed by Governmental
Entities.

  



  

(c) The parties agree that the existing Legal Proceedings set forth on
_Schedule 10.3(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Excluded
Litigation Matters_ ") constitute pre-existing Third Party Claims which were
initiated prior to the date hereof and for which proper notice has been
given. The Seller hereby expressly agrees to retain control of the Excluded
Litigation Matters pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)(ii)_ as the Indemnifying
Party following the Initial Closing. The parties further agree that the
Excluded Litigation Matters will remain and be treated as Third Party Claims
after the Initial Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees that the outside
legal counsel currently retained by the Seller in the Excluded Litigation
Matters may continue to represent the interests of the Seller, subject to the
parties rights pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_.  Each party further agrees
that it will cooperate and assist the other party in preserving and enforcing
any third Person intellectual property indemnification protection rights
available to such party in connection with the Excluded Litigation Matters,
and will make available its employees as reasonably necessary in the defense
by the other party of any Excluded Litigation Matter.

  



  

10.4 _Indemnification_. The Purchaser will not (and will cause the other
members of the Purchaser Group and the Acquired Companies not to), for
a period of six (6) years after the Initial Closing, take any action
to alter or impair any exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing
in the charter or bylaws (or comparable constituent document) of each
Acquired Company for the benefit of any individual who served as a director
or officer of such Acquired Company, as applicable, at any time prior to the
Initial Closing (each an " _Affiliate Indemnified Party_ "), except for any
changes which may be required to conform with changes in applicable law and
any changes which do not affect the application of such provisions to acts or
omissions of such individuals prior to the Initial Closing.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding the provisions
of _Section 8.6_ hereof, the provisions of this _Section 10.4_ are

  



        
   

  



  

intended for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, each of the Affiliate
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs.

  



  

10.5 _Confidential Information_. The parties agree as follows:

  



  

(a) The Seller agrees that from and after the Initial Closing Date it shall,
and shall cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates
to, keep the terms of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, as
well as the Business Confidential Information (as defined below) and the
Purchaser Confidential Information (as defined below), confidential for a
period of two (2) years from the Initial Closing Date, except that any
Business Confidential Information and any Purchaser Confidential Information
may be disclosed if such disclosure is (i) required by law or any regulatory
body, or (ii) necessary to establish rights under this Agreement, and except
that the terms of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions may be
disclosed (x) if such disclosure is required by law or any regulatory body,
or necessary to establish rights under this Agreement, or (y) to (A) the
Sellers shareholders, potential investors, potential strategic partners and
financing sources in each case to the extent that they are bound to a
comparable level of confidentiality as set forth in this Agreement, and (B)
the Sellers attorneys, agents and accountants (and its Affiliates) on a
reasonable need to know basis. **** For purposes hereof, the term " _Business
Confidential Information_ " means all information that relates to the
Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and the
term " _Purchaser Confidential Information_ " means all information of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates provided to the Seller in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, in each case other than any such information that
(A) is available to the public on the Initial Closing Date, or thereafter
becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
_Section 10.5_; (B) is disclosed by the Purchaser to a third party without
an obligation of confidence; (C) can be shown by the Seller to have been
developed by it completely independently of the Business; or (D) can be shown
by the Seller to have been rightfully received completely independently from
a third party without any obligation of confidence.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser agrees that from and after the Initial Closing Date it
shall, and shall cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to, keep the terms of this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, as well as the Seller
Confidential Information (as defined below), confidential for a period of two
(2) years from the Initial Closing Date, except that any Seller Confidential
Information may be disclosed if such disclosure is (i) required by law or any
regulatory body, or (ii) necessary to establish rights under this Agreement,
and except that the terms of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
may be disclosed (x) if such disclosure is required by law or any regulatory
body, or necessary to establish rights under this Agreement, or (y) to (A)
the Purchasers shareholders, potential investors, potential strategic
partners and financing sources in each case to the extent that they are bound
to a comparable level of confidentiality as set forth in this Agreement, and
(B) the Purchasers attorneys, agents and accountants (and its Affiliates) on
a reasonable need to know basis. For purposes hereof, the term "
_Seller Confidential Information_ " means all information of the Seller and
its Affiliates (excluding, for such purpose and for the avoidance of any
doubt, the Acquired Companies) that relates to the Excluded Assets or the
Excluded Liabilities and provided to the Purchaser in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions or otherwise in the possession of the Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates (including an Acquired Company) from and after the
Initial Closing, other than any such information that (A) is

  



        
   

  



  

available to the public on the Initial Closing Date, or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
10.5_; (B) is disclosed by the Seller to a third party without an obligation
of confidence; (C) can be shown by the Purchaser to have been developed by
it completely independently of the Seller; or (D) can be shown by
the Purchaser to have been rightfully received completely independently from
a third party without any obligation of confidence. If, at any time after the
Initial Closing, any Acquired Company discovers that it possesses any Seller
Confidential Information, the Purchaser or such Acquired Company, as
applicable, will promptly notify the Seller, and based on the Sellers
instructions and at the Sellers cost, transfer or cause to be transferred,
such Seller Confidential Information to the Seller (without retaining a copy
thereof). For the purposes of this Agreement, Seller Confidential Information
includes written, graphical or machine-readable information that relates to
trade secrets, product plans, software, vendor and customer information,
business plans and data stored electronically, to the extent that any such
information is not necessary or for the operations of the business of any
Acquired Company. The Purchaser will use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate, and
will cause each Acquired Company to use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate, with
the Seller to identify any Seller Confidential Information that is in the
possession of any such Person.

  



  

(c) In no event will the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any Affiliate
or agent of those Persons involved in the operation of the Business advertise
or hold itself out as the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller after the
Initial Closing Date.

  



  

10.6 _Assignment of Contracts and Permits_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
does not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer, or effect an
assignment or transfer, of any Acquired Asset, including any Assumed Contract
or Assigned Permit, or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom, if the Seller has not obtained a required consent to
assignment or transfer as of the applicable Closing and an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof without the consent of a third
party (including any Governmental Entity) would constitute a breach or
other contravention thereof or a violation of law or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of the Seller or any member of the Seller Group
or the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group (as assignee of the
applicable member of the Seller Group) thereto or thereunder.

  



  

(b) As to any Assumed Contract or Assigned Permit referred to in _Section
10.6(a)_, the Seller agrees to continue to use Reasonable Efforts from and
after the applicable Closing Date until the date that is twelve (12) months
following the applicable Closing Date to obtain any required consent(s). No
member of the Seller Group shall under any circumstances be required to make
any payments required or sought by any third party for any such consent or
otherwise in connection with its obligations under this _Section 10.6_. If,
on the Initial Closing Date, any such consent is not obtained, or if an
attempted transfer or assignment of any Assumed Contract or Assigned Permit
would be ineffective or a violation of law or would impair any member of the
Purchaser Groups rights thereto or thereunder so that the Purchaser Group
would not receive all such rights, then the Seller and the Purchaser will use
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate for twelve (12) months following the Initial
Closing in any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to the extent such
cooperation would not result in a breach of the terms of such

  



         
 

  



  

Assumed Contract, to the extent permitted under such Assigned Permit, and, in
each case, not prohibited under applicable law, which will provide the
Purchaser Group the obligations and benefits of any such Assumed Contract or
Assigned Permit, including subcontracting, licensing, sublicensing, leasing
or subleasing to the Purchaser Group any or all of the Seller Groups rights
and obligations with respect to such Assumed Contract or Assigned Permit. In
any such arrangement, the Purchaser will (i) bear the sole responsibility for
completion of the work or provision of goods and services, (ii) bear all
Taxes with respect thereto or arising therefrom, (iii) be solely entitled to
all benefits thereof, economic or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for
any warranty or breach thereof, any repurchase, indemnity and service
obligations thereof and any damages related to termination of such Assumed
Contracts or Assigned Permits, and (v) promptly reimburse the reasonable
costs and expenses of the Seller and its Affiliates related thereto. If and
when such consents or approvals are obtained or such other required actions
have been taken, the transfer of such Assumed Contract or Assigned Permit
will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

10.7 _Shared Contracts_.

  



  

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement, the Seller
shall provide the Purchaser with a list of all material Shared Contracts,
indicating which of such material Shared Contracts may be assigned in part,
pursuant to its terms, without the consent of the counterparty thereto or
other conditions, including the payment of a transfer or other fee (the "
_Assignable Shared Contracts_ "). Within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof, the Purchaser will provide the Seller with written notice of
those Assignable Shared Contracts that the Purchaser desires to assume in
part. Each such Assignable Shared Contract for which the Purchaser provides
written notice of its desire to assume in part shall thereafter be deemed to
be an Assumed Contract hereunder and the Seller shall partially assign to the
Purchaser as of the Initial Closing such Contract in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

(b) With respect to each material Shared Contract identified pursuant to the
first sentence of _subsection (a)_ above that is not an Assignable Shared
Contract (the " _Non-Assignable Shared Contracts_ "), the Purchaser will
also, within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, provide the Seller with
written notice of those Non-Assignable Shared Contracts that the Purchaser
desires to assume in part. Each party shall use its Reasonable Efforts prior
to the Initial Closing Date to cause the counterparty to each such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract to consent to the partial assignment of such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract to the Purchaser, or to otherwise enter into a new
Contract with the Purchaser on substantially the same terms as exist
under the applicable Shared Contract, in each case as of the Initial Closing.
Each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the parties have received
consent to the partial assignment shall thereafter be deemed to be an Assumed
Contract hereunder and the Seller shall partially assign to the Purchaser as
of the Initial Closing such Contract in accordance with its terms. The
Seller shall not take any action to terminate prior to its expiration
any Non-Assignable Shared Contract that is a Material Contract and which has
been identified by the Purchaser as one it desires to assume pursuant to this
_subsection (b)_ , or take any action or fail to take any action that would
permit the other party to any such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to
terminate prior to its expiration such Shared Contract, in each case, prior
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Initial Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be required to

  



        
   

  



  

partially assign to the Purchaser at the Initial Closing any of the Non-
Assignable Shared Contracts for which consent has not been obtained.

  



  

(c) With respect to each Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the
arrangements described in _Section 10.7(b)_ could not be entered into prior
to the Initial Closing Date the Seller agrees to continue to use Reasonable
Efforts from and after the Initial Closing Date until the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Initial Closing Date to cause the counterparty to
each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to consent to the partial assignment
of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to the Purchaser, or to otherwise
enter into a new Contract with the Purchaser on substantially the same terms
as exist under the applicable Shared Contract. Until any such consent or new
Contract is obtained, the Seller and the Purchaser will use Reasonable
Efforts to cooperate for twelve (12) months following the Initial Closing, in
any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to the extent such cooperation would
not result in a breach of the terms of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract,
and not prohibited under applicable law, which will provide the Purchaser
Group the obligations and benefits of any such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
with respect to the Business, including subcontracting, licensing,
sublicensing, leasing or subleasing to the Purchaser Group any or all of the
Seller Groups rights and obligations with respect to such Non-Assignable
Shared Contract with respect to the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , with
respect to the Contracts identified on _Schedule 10.7(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the Seller and the Purchaser will use Reasonable Efforts
to cooperate until the earlier of two (2) years following the Initial Closing
or the expiration of the remaining term of such Contract.  In any such
arrangement, the Purchaser will (i) bear the sole responsibility for
completion of the work or provision of goods and services, (ii) bear all
Taxes with respect thereto or arising therefrom, (iii) be solely entitled to
all benefits thereof, economic or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for
any warranty or breach thereof, any repurchase, indemnity and service
obligations thereof and any damages related to termination of such Non-
Assignable Shared Contracts, and (v) promptly reimburse the reasonable costs
and expenses of the Seller and its Affiliates related thereto. If and when
such consents or approvals are obtained or such other required actions have
been taken, the partial assignment of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser each agree that "Reasonable Efforts" for
purposes of this _Section 10.7_ includes an obligation on the Purchaser to
provide financial information, subject to receipt from the counterparty to a
Shared Contract of an executed confidentiality agreement, and the Purchaser
agrees to, and agrees to cause any of its subsidiaries to, enter into a
guaranty, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by the counterparty to
a Shared Contract.

  



  

10.8 _Transfer of Acquired Assets; Risk of Loss_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser will, at the Purchasers cost and expense, prepare for the
removal and relocation of any Tangible Personal Property (excluding
furniture, furnishings, shared equipment and fixtures) located at the
facilities set forth on _Schedule 10.8(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, which are currently occupied by the Seller or any other member of
the Seller Group and which facilities are not to be purchased, assigned,
subleased, transferred to or otherwise occupied by the Purchaser Group
pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller Lease/Sublease Agreements, the Joint
Use and Occupancy Agreements or any other agreement

  



        
   

  



  

entered into in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, or, if a third
party facility, the contract for which is not an Assumed Contract (each
such facility, an " _Excluded Seller Facility_ ") and remove and relocate
such Acquired Assets from the relevant Excluded Seller Facility with respect
to any such facilities that include a Lab or Testbed, within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the applicable Closing Date and, with respect to such
remaining facilities, within ninety (90) days of the applicable Closing Date
(as applicable, the " _Purchaser Relocation Deadline_ "). The Seller will (i)
at the Sellers cost and expense, prepare for the removal and relocation of
any tangible Excluded Assets (excluding furniture, furnishings, shared
equipment and fixtures) located at the facilities set forth on _Schedule
10.8(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which are currently occupied
by the Seller or any other member of the Seller Group and which facilities
are to be purchased, assigned or transferred to the Purchaser Group and not
subleased or otherwise occupied by the Seller Group following the applicable
Closing pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser Lease/Sublease Agreements,
the Joint Use and Occupancy Agreements or any other agreement entered into in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions (each such facility, a " _Post-
Closing Purchaser Facility_ ") and remove and relocate such Excluded Assets
from the relevant Post-Closing Purchaser Facility within ninety (90) days of
the applicable Closing Date (as applicable, the " _Seller Relocation
Deadline_ "). Subject to the provisions hereof, each of the Seller and the
Purchaser agrees to cooperate, and agrees to cause the other members of the
Seller Group or the Purchaser Group, as applicable, to cooperate with the
Purchaser Group and the Seller Group, as applicable, and provide
the Purchaser Group or the Seller Group, as applicable, all assistance
reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the planning and
implementation of the removal and relocation of any such Acquired Assets or
Excluded Assets or any thereof to such location as the Purchaser or the
Seller, as applicable, will designate.

  



  

(i) Such Acquired Assets will be transported by or on behalf of
the Purchaser, and until all of such Acquired Assets are removed from an
Excluded Seller Facility, the Seller will permit, and will cause the other
members of the Seller Group to permit, the Purchaser and its authorized
agents or representatives, upon reasonable prior notice, to have reasonable
access to such Excluded Seller Facility during normal business hours to the
extent necessary to comply with the terms of this _Section 10.8_
including to disconnect, detach, remove, package and crate such Acquired
Assets for transport. The Purchaser will be responsible for (A)
disconnecting and detaching all fixtures and equipment comprising such
Acquired Assets from the roofs, floor, ceiling and walls of an Excluded
Seller Facility prior to removing the same from such Excluded
Seller Facility, (B) packaging and loading such Acquired Assets for
transporting to and any reinstallation of such Acquired Assets at such
location(s) as the Purchaser may determine, and (C) repairing any damage that
is caused by such removal, the parties agreeing that the Purchaser shall
leave the applicable premises in broom clean condition and in no better
condition than the remainder of the premises generally.

  



  

(ii) Such Excluded Assets will be transported by or on behalf of the
Seller, and until all of such Excluded Assets are removed from a Post-Closing
Purchaser Facility, the Purchaser will permit, and will cause the other
members of the Purchaser Group to permit, the Seller and its authorized
agents or representatives, upon reasonable prior notice, to have reasonable
access to such Post-Closing Purchaser Facility during normal business hours
to the extent necessary to comply with the terms of this _Section_ 

  



        
   

  



  

 _10.8_ including to disconnect, detach, remove, package and crate
such Excluded Assets for transport. The Seller will be responsible for (A)
disconnecting and detaching all fixtures and equipment comprising such
Excluded Assets from the roofs, floor, ceiling and walls of a Post-Closing
Purchaser Facility prior to removing the same from such Post-Closing
Purchaser Facility, (B) packaging and loading such Excluded Assets for
transporting to and any reinstallation of such Excluded Assets at such
location(s) as the Seller may determine, and (C) repairing any damage that is
caused by such removal, the parties agreeing that the Seller shall leave the
applicable premises in broom clean condition and in no better condition than
the remainder of the premises generally.

  



  

(b) All risk of loss as to the Acquired Assets will be borne by, and will
pass to, the Purchaser Group as of the applicable Closing for each such
Acquired Asset.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 10.8(b)_, (i) the Seller will
reimburse and indemnify the Purchaser and the Purchaser Group to the extent
that any of the Acquired Assets are damaged, destroyed or lost following the
Initial Closing Date and prior to a Purchaser Relocation Deadline as a result
of the willful misconduct of the Seller or any of its Affiliates and (ii) the
Purchaser will reimburse and indemnify the Seller and the Seller Group to the
extent that any of the Excluded Assets are damaged, destroyed or lost
following the Initial Closing Date and prior to a Seller Relocation Deadline
as a result of the willful misconduct of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates. All claims by the Purchaser or the Seller hereunder and any
reimbursements and indemnities by the Purchaser or the Seller required
hereunder shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 8.3_, but shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 8.5_.

  



  

(d) Within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof, the Seller shall provide
to the Purchaser a schedule of (i) all Tangible Personal Property located at
any Excluded Seller Facility and (ii) any Lab or Testbed that is currently
located in an Excluded Seller Facility and must be removed and relocated in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.8_.

  



  

(e) In the event that the Purchaser or the Seller has not removed and
relocated any such Acquired Assets or Excluded Assets, as applicable, at an
Excluded Seller Facility or Post-Closing Purchaser Facility by the applicable
Purchaser Relocation Deadline or Seller Relocation Deadline, the Purchaser or
the Seller, as applicable, shall be deemed to have abandoned such Acquired
Assets or Excluded Assets, and such Acquired Assets or Excluded Assets shall
automatically, without any further action required by either party, become
the property of the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable.

  



  

10.9 _Certain Real Property Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Seller and/or its Affiliates have provided certain corporate
guarantees (including bank guarantees, parent company guarantees and real
property lease guarantees), cash security deposits and payment advances, or
have obtained certain performance, bid, customs, warranty, court or indemnity
bonds and/or letters of credit or letters of comfort as security for
performance of the tenants obligations under one or more Assumed Real
Property Leases (each, a " _Lease Security Instrument_ "). The Purchaser shall
use Reasonable Efforts to, or shall cause its Affiliates to use Reasonable
Efforts to, replace or otherwise cause to be released or terminated

  



        
   

  



  

the Lease Security Instrument on or prior to the Initial Closing Date or as
soon as practicable thereafter. The Purchaser agrees, unconditionally and
irrevocably, to reimburse and indemnify the Seller for and against all
payments, costs and expenses incurred after the Initial Closing and relating
to any Lease Security Instrument that are not replaced, released or
terminated on or prior to the Initial Closing Date (provided that the
Purchaser shall have no obligation for any payments, costs and/or
expenses resulting from Excluded Liabilities), in each case until the
complete and unconditional release of the Sellers and its Affiliates
obligations with respect thereto. All claims by the Seller hereunder and any
reimbursements and indemnities by the Purchaser required hereunder shall be
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section 8.3_, but
shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.5_.

  



  

(b) At the Purchasers sole cost and expense, the Purchaser shall promptly
and, in any event, within sixty (60) days following the Initial Closing Date
remove, or cause to be removed, from the Acquired Real Property any and all
identification signage including signs, windows or door lettering, placards,
decorations or advertising media of any type (collectively, the " _Seller
Signage_ ") relating to the Seller Group or containing any Intellectual
Property of the Seller Group other than the rights of the Seller (if any)
which were transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the IP Agreement. The
Purchaser shall use its Reasonable Efforts to minimize any damage to the
Seller Signage in connection with the removal of same, and following such
removal, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller of such removal and
coordinate with the Seller for delivery of all such Seller Signage to the
Seller at such location as may be specified by the Seller, unless the Seller
provides a written request to the Purchaser for the Purchaser to coordinate
the prompt destruction and disposition of such Seller Signage in accordance
with applicable law. All costs of delivery to the Seller of any Seller
Signage, as directed by Seller, shall be paid solely by Seller.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) as of the Initial Closing
Date, the Seller Group will cancel any and all of its insurance policies and
coverages with respect to the Acquired Real Property, and (ii) from and after
the Initial Closing Date, (A) the Purchaser assumes any and all Liabilities
with respect to maintaining insurance on the Acquired Real Property, and (B)
the Seller Group shall have no Liability whatsoever with respect thereto.

  



  

(d) The Seller will, and will cause each member of the Seller Group to, use
its Reasonable Efforts and at its sole cost and expense prior to the Initial
Closing Date to (i) obtain each consent identified on  _Schedule 10.9(d)-1_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) obtain an SNDA for each of the Seller
Lease/Sublease Agreements set forth on _Schedule 10.9(d)-2_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and the Purchaser shall use Reasonable Efforts to
cooperate with the Seller in connection therewith.

  



  

(e) The Seller and the Purchaser shall use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate
with the other (i) in connection with the transition of ownership of the
Acquired Real Property and to facilitate the continuous, uninterrupted
operation of each Acquired Real Property and (ii) prior to the Initial
Closing Date and at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser, in minimizing
the amount of any increase in Taxes payable with respect to any Acquired Real
Property due to a reassessment or revaluation of such Acquired Real Property
by the applicable taxing authority as the result of the Contemplated
Transactions, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.

  



        
   

  



  

10.10 _Proration_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller agree that those items listed below, to the
extent they relate to the Acquired Assets, will be prorated without
duplication of any such items as of the Initial Closing Date, and will be
excluded from the Final Closing Date Statement of Net Assets, with the Seller
liable to the extent such items relate to any time period prior to
and through the Initial Closing Date, and the Purchaser liable to the extent
such items relate to periods subsequent to the Initial Closing Date (measured
in the same units used to compute the item in question, otherwise measured by
calendar days):

  



  

(i) any Property Taxes imposed on the Acquired Assets shall be prorated based
on the number of days in such taxable period up to and including the Initial
Closing Date, and on the number of days in such taxable period after the
Initial Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the items listed in this
_Section 10.10(a)_ include any Property Taxes with respect to the taxable
period including the Initial Closing Date, and all prior taxable periods, for
which the Seller has not (A) received from the county treasurer a statement
of current and delinquent Taxes and special assessments or (B) paid the
amount shown as due on such statement); and

  



  

(ii) rent due under any Assumed Real Property Lease and any other
amounts pursuant to the terms of any such lease.

  



  

(b) In connection with the prorations referred to in _subsection (a)_ above,
in the event that actual figures are not available at the Initial Closing
Date, the proration shall be based upon the actual Taxes or rents for the
preceding year (or other appropriate period) for which actual Taxes or rents
are available and such Taxes or rents shall be re-prorated upon request of
either the Seller or the Purchaser made within forty-five (45) days of the
date that the actual amounts become available. The Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with such actual Tax or rent information within fifteen (15) business
days of the Purchasers receipt thereof. The Purchaser shall cooperate with
the Seller in the prosecution of Tax proceedings which have not been
completed by the Initial Closing Date. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to
furnish each other with such documents and other records as may be reasonably
requested in order to confirm all adjustment and proration calculations made
pursuant to this _Section 10.10_.

  



  

10.11 _Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a) For a period beginning on the Initial Closing Date until the date which
is two (2) years after the Initial Closing Date, the Seller will not, and
will not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, that is engaged in, or otherwise competes
with, the Business in the United States or in those other countries in which
the Business is presently conducted. The activities of the Business as
presently conducted are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "
_Seller Competitive Activities_."

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of _Section 10.11(a)_ shall not prohibit the Seller or any of its
Affiliates from engaging

  



        
   

  



  

in the business of designing, manufacturing or selling (i) Cable
Broadband Networks products (such as optical network products), Private
Broadband Network products (such as two-way radio infrastructure), Telco
Broadband Network products (such as femtocells, Netopia gateways and
routers), Wireless Broadband Network products (such as Mesh Networks and
Point-to-Multipoint Networks) and Wireless LAN products (such as access
points (including access points containing cellular technology in combination
with Wireless LAN technology) and switches), (ii) WiMAX and LTE and other
network infrastructure end-to-end solutions, including associated products,
software and services, sold to any Governmental Entity or enterprise customer
or for other private networks (including roaming services for the purpose of
providing end-to-end solutions for interoperability between private networks
and public cellular networks); and (iii) applications and services, including
location based services, service delivery platforms, mobile video and mobile
payment, commerce and advertising. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that this _subsection (b)_ shall not allow the Seller or any of its
Affiliates to design and manufacture WiMAX (other than fixed, point-to-point
WiMAX), Lower LTE Core (comprised of Mobility Management Entity and Serving
Gateway) or eNodeB products for public telecommunications operators.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10.11(a)_, the acquisition
(by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates of the stock, business or assets of any
Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in Seller Competitive
Activities, and the continuation of such Seller Competitive Activities
following such acquisition shall not be in breach of the terms of this
_Section 10.11_ if: (i) the portion of the revenues of such Person and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the fiscal year ending prior to the
date of such acquisition that is attributable to Seller Competitive
Activities by such Person and its subsidiaries (" _Seller Competitive
Revenues_ ") account for less than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues of
such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such fiscal
year; or (ii) in the event the foregoing condition is not satisfied, the
Seller offers, or causes its Affiliates to offer the portion of such business
or assets that represent Seller Competitive Activities to the Purchaser and
negotiates in good faith with the Purchaser as to the terms and conditions of
the Purchasers purchase of such business and assets, provided that (A) if
the Purchaser notifies the Seller in writing that it is unwilling to purchase
such business or assets, or (B) if following such good faith negotiations,
the parties are unable to reach agreements on the terms of such a purchase,
the Seller promptly uses its Reasonable Efforts to sell such business or
assets, including by actively marketing the business or assets on
commercially reasonable terms.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this _Section 10.11_ will restrict or prevent the Seller or
any of its Affiliates from maintaining and/or undertaking passive investments
in Persons primarily engaged in the Seller Competitive Activities so long as
the aggregate interest represented by such investments does not exceed (i) 5%
of any class of the outstanding debt or equity securities of any such Person,
in the case of a Person whose shares are listed on a national securities
exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System or equivalent foreign exchange
or quotation system or (ii) 5% of any class of the outstanding equity or debt
securities in the case of any other Person.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section
10.11_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser
time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant

  



        
   

  



  

feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and
not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable party. The
parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for
any breach of the foregoing may be inadequate and that the Purchaser, in
addition to any other relief available to it, will be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.

  



  

10.12 _Closing of Books_. Each party agrees to consult in good faith and
cooperate with the other party and its representatives, advisors
and employees, including by making its employees and advisors available to
the other party as reasonably requested, in the closing of the Seller Groups
books and records with respect to the Business as of the Initial Closing Date
in accordance with the Sellers regular closing schedule and procedures.

  



  

10.13 _Parent Guarantees_. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser (each, a "
_Guarantor_ ") irrevocably guarantees the timely performance of each
and every agreement and obligation of each other member of the Seller Group
and the Purchaser Group, respectively, under the provisions of the
Transaction Agreements. This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and
not of collection, and each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this
guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of each
Guarantors Liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will
affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee. Each
Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of the other party, (a) any right to
require the other party as a condition of payment or performance of the
Guarantor to proceed against the other members of the Seller Group or the
Purchaser Group, as applicable, or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and
(b) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is
available to the other members of the Seller Group or the Purchaser Group, as
applicable. Each Guarantor understands that the other party is relying on
this guarantee in entering into the Transaction Agreements.

  



  

10.14 _Financial Statement Cooperation_. The Seller shall use Reasonable
Efforts to, and to cause KPMG LLP to, cooperate for a period of three (3)
years following the Initial Closing Date in preparing and auditing, as
applicable, at the Purchasers expense, any financial statements that the
Purchaser may request in connection with its future financing or any public
offering of securities, such financial statements to be compliant with any
applicable regulations regarding financial statements of businesses acquired
or to be acquired.

by the Seller and the Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after written
notice (a " _Notice_ ") by one of the parties demanding mediation.
Neither party may unreasonably withhold consent to the selection of a
mediator, however, by mutual agreement the Seller and the Purchaser may
postpone mediation until each has completed specified but limited discovery
with respect to a dispute. The parties may also agree to attempt some other
form of alternative dispute resolution (" _ADR_ ") in lieu of mediation,
including by way of example neutral fact-finding or a mini-trial. Any
mediation pursuant to this section or ADR in lieu thereof, as applicable,
will be subject to the following:

  



  

(I) The mediation will be conducted in the English language in New York,
New York and will be attended by representatives of the parties;

  



  

(II) The mediator will be a neutral, independent and disinterested person,
and will be selected from a professional mediation firm such as ADR
Associates, JAMS/ENDISPUTE or CPR;

  



  

(III) The parties will promptly confer in an effort to select a mediator
by agreement. In the absence of such an agreement within fifteen (15) days
of receipt of a Notice, the parties agree to select a mediator affiliated
with CPR, which will be selected by CPR as follows: CPR will provide the
parties with a list of at least fifteen (15) names from the CPR Panels of
Distinguished Neutrals. Each party will exercise challenges for cause, two
peremptory challenges, and rank the remaining candidates within five (5)
business days of receiving the CPR list. The Purchaser and the Seller may
together interview the three top-ranked

  



        
   

  



  

candidates for no more than one hour each and, after the interviews, may each
exercise one peremptory challenge. The mediator will be the remaining
candidate with the highest aggregate ranking;

  



  

(IV) The mediator will confer with the parties to design procedures to
conclude the mediation within no more than thirty (30) days from selection of
the mediator; and

  



  

(V) Each party agrees not to use the period or pendency of the mediation
to disadvantage the other party procedurally or otherwise.

  



  

(B) Any Dispute, other than a dispute with respect to Intellectual
Property which must be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction (as
determined pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_), which the parties cannot
resolve through negotiation, mediation or other form of ADR within ninety
(90) days of the date of the Notice for it by one of the parties may then be
submitted to the courts for resolution pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_. The
use of any ADR procedures will not be construed under the doctrines of
laches, waiver or estoppel to affect adversely the rights of either party.
Nothing in this _Section 11.1(b)_ will prevent either party from
resorting to judicial proceedings if (I) good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute under these procedures have been unsuccessful or (II) interim relief
from a court is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to one
party or to others.

  



  

(C) All offers of compromise or settlement among the parties or
their representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any
Dispute shall be deemed confidential settlement communications that have been
delivered in furtherance of a Dispute settlement and shall be exempt from
discovery and production and shall not be admissible in evidence (whether as
an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for the resolution of the
Dispute.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware over any dispute arising
out of or relating to the Transaction Agreements or any agreement or
instrument contemplated thereby or entered into in connection herewith or
therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition of any judgment relating thereto. Each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees not to commence any action relating to such a
dispute or proceeding except in such courts and that all claims in respect of
such dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and
the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute
brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection
therewith. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any dispute or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS
RIGHT TO

  



     

      
 

  



  

TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

11.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective
successors and assignees, but neither party may assign either this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
without the consent of the other party either party may assign all or part of
its rights under this Agreement and delegate all or part of its obligations
under this Agreement to one or more Persons, the majority of the capital
stock or equity interest of which are owned, directly or indirectly, by such
party, in which event all the rights and powers of such party and the
remedies available to it under this Agreement shall extend to and be
enforceable by each such assignee; and _provided_ _further_ that (A)
the party making the assignment shall remain fully responsible for the
performance of all its obligations hereunder (notwithstanding that any such
obligations may have been assigned to the assignee) and (B) such assignee
executes a written agreement of assumption of such obligations in a form
reasonably acceptable to the other party. In the event of any such
assignment and delegation referred to above, the term " _Seller_ " or "
_Purchaser_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to each such
assignee of the applicable party where appropriate, and shall be deemed to
include both such party and each such assignee where appropriate.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event the Seller separates one or
more of its businesses (each a " _Separated Business_ "), whether by way of a
sale, establishment of a joint venture, spin-off or otherwise, the Seller
may, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser and at no additional
cost to the Seller, assign this Agreement in whole or in part. The Separated
Business shall be entitled to enjoy the benefits of the post-Closing
covenants and shall be subject to the post-Closing obligations under _Article
10_ of this Agreement as if the Separated Business were the Seller, and shall
execute a written agreement of assumption of such obligations in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser; _provided_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, that following any such assignment by the Seller, the Seller shall be
responsible for breaches of the obligations of the Separated Business under
this Agreement (other than breaches by the Separated Business of _Section
10.11_).

  



  

11.3 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions
of this Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and enforceable. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions_. This Agreement, together with
the other Transaction Agreements and all of the exhibits and schedules
appended hereto and thereto,

  



        
   

  



  

constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the parties
agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and
contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on
the matters contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
are superseded by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
including, but subject to _Section 5.5(b)_ hereof, the NDA. In the event of
any conflict between any specific provision of this Agreement and the
provisions of the IP Agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof,
the provisions of the IP Agreement will control, and in the event of any
conflict between any specific provision of this Agreement and the provisions
of the Employee Matters Agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof,
the provisions of the Employee Matters Agreement will control.

  



  

11.5 _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission which includes a copy of the sending partys signature(s) is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

  



  

11.6 _Expenses_. Except to the extent specified otherwise in this Agreement,
each party will pay its own costs, professional fees and other expenses
(including all legal, accounting, broker, finder or investment banker fees)
incurred by it in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

11.7 _Amendment_. The parties may amend this Agreement only by a written
agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to
this Agreement.

  



  

11.8 _Waiver_. The parties may waive a provision of this Agreement only by a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought.
A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the
partys favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or
remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent
that the party specifically waives the same in writing.  A written waiver
given for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only
for the purpose stated.  A waiver once given is not to be construed as a
waiver for any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a partys rights
and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a partys
rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by
law and include any rights and remedies authorized in law or in equity.

  



  

11.9 _Notices_. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this
Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been
duly given (a) when received if delivered personally; (b) when transmitted if
sent by facsimile or telecopy transmission (with transmission confirmed); (c)
the day after it is sent, if sent by commercial overnight courier; or (d)
upon receipt, if sent be pre-paid, certified or registered mail (return
receipt requested). Notice to a party is effective for purposes of this
Agreement only if given as provided in this _Section 11.9_ at the address
set forth below or another address of which the sending party has been
notified in accordance with this _Section 11.9_:

11.10 _Construction of Agreement_.

party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement.

its own attorney. This Agreement is not to be construed for or against any
party based on which party drafted any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The captions, titles, headings, recitals and table of contents, included
in this Agreement are for convenience only, and do not affect the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) This Agreement does not, and is not intended to, confer any rights or
remedies in favor of any Person other than the parties signing this
Agreement, except as may be specifically set forth in other provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

(e) The words "including," "includes," or "include" are to be read as listing
non-exclusive examples of the matters referred to, whether or not words such
as "without limitation" or "but not limited to" are used in each instance.

  



  

(f) The words "hereof, "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including any annexes, exhibits and schedules to this Agreement) and not to

otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
