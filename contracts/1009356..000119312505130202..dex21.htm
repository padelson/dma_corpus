preferred stock purchase rights under the Steel Rights Plan ("Steel Common

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



Article I

The Merger

 



Section 1.1. The Merger



Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law ("New York Law"), at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into Iron (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Iron shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steel.



Section 1.2. Effective Time



As promptly as practicable on the Closing Date (as defined in Section
1.6), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the New York
Department of State, as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, New York Law (the time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger or the time specified therein being the "Effective
Time").



Section 1.3. Effect of the Merger



At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of New York Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and purposes of Merger Sub and Iron shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all liabilities, obligations and penalties
of Merger Sub and Iron shall become the liabilities, obligations and
penalties of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws



At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as amended by the
Certificate of Merger, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.



 

2 Section 1.5. Directors and Officers



The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately upon the
effectiveness of the Merger shall be as set forth on Schedule 1.5 hereto,
each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified, as the case may be.



Section 1.6. Closing 



Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place no later than the second Business Day
after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VIII hereof (the "Closing Date") at the offices of Wyrick Robbins
Yates and Ponton LLP, 4101 Lake Boone Trail, Suite 300, Raleigh, North Carolina,
or at such other time, date and place as agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.



Section 1.7. Subsequent Actions



If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to
continue in, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties, privileges, franchises or assets of either of its constituent
corporations acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
and hereby are directed and authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of either of such constituent corporations, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties,
privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement.



Section 1.8. Tax and Accounting Treatment of the Merger



It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall (a) qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b)
be accounted for as a purchase under United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). The parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 354(a)(1)
and Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations, and intend that each of Steel, Merger Sub and Iron be a "party to
a reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 368(b).



 

3 Article II

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates



Section 2.1. Conversion of Securities



At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Steel, Merger Sub, Iron or the holders of any of the securities
referred to in this Section 2.1:



(a) Common Stock. Each share of Iron Common Stock (excluding any shares
described in Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive a fraction of a share of Steel Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange Ratio" shall equal $3.55 divided
by the Steel Share Price and rounded to four decimal places; provided however,
that if the Steel Share Price is greater than $20.44, then the Exchange Ratio
shall equal 0.1737 and if the Steel Share Price is less than $16.00, then the
Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.2219. The "Steel Share Price" shall mean the
average (rounded to the nearest cent) of the per share closing prices of Steel
Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq for the forty trading days ending on the
second trading day prior to the Closing Date. The shares of Steel Common Stock
issuable to the holders of Iron Common Stock pursuant hereto (including shares
to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of any Iron Convertible Securities
to be assumed by Steel pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), together with
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
2.1(d), is sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the "Merger
Consideration". All shares of Iron Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate previously evidencing any such shares shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable law, the holders of certificates
previously evidencing such shares of Iron Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Iron Common Stock. Each such certificate
previously evidencing such shares of Iron Common Stock shall be exchanged for
the number of shares previously evidenced by the canceled certificate upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.2 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.



(b) Treasury Stock. All shares of capital stock of Iron held in the treasury
of Iron immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no amount shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.



(c) Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one (1) duly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



 

4 (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing any fractional
shares of Steel Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and
other than the right to receive the cash payment pursuant to this Section
2.1(d), any such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
any rights as a securityholder of Steel. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, all holders of Iron Common Stock otherwise entitled to receive
fractional shares of Steel Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Steel Common
Stock to which the holder of Iron Common Stock would otherwise be entitled
under Section 2.1(a) multiplied by the closing price per share of
Steel Common Stock on the Closing Date. As promptly as possible after the
determination of the amount of cash to be paid to holders of fractional
interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Steel, and Steel shall deposit
such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to holders of such fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.



(e) Restricted Stock. Each share of Iron Common Stock that, as of the
Effective Time, remains subject to repurchase by Iron in the event a
Iron employee ceases to be employed by Iron ("Iron Restricted Stock") shall
be converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof;
_provided, however_ , that the Steel Common Stock issuable to the holder of
the Iron Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be registered in
such holders name, but shall be held by the Surviving Corporation or Steel
pending the satisfaction of the applicable vesting periods and acceleration
terms pursuant to existing agreements in effect at the Effective Time. Iron
hereby assigns to the Surviving Corporation all repurchase rights relating to
the Iron Restricted Stock, effective at the Effective Time. A listing of the
holders of Iron Restricted Stock as of the date hereof, together with the
number of shares of Iron Restricted Stock held by each (and the vesting terms
relating thereto), is set forth in Section 2.1(e) of the Iron Schedule of
Exceptions.



Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates



(a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Steel shall deposit the Merger
Consideration with Wachovia Bank or an exchange agent designated by Steel and
reasonably acceptable to Iron (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
former holders of shares of Iron Common Stock (excluding any shares described
in Section 2.1(b) or 2.1(e)), for issuance and payment in accordance with this
Article II. Steel shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, to deliver the Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections 2.1(a)
and 2.1(d).



(b) Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Steel shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as
of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates (each a
"Certificate" and collectively, the "Certificates") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of Iron Common Stock
(excluding any shares described in Section 2.1(b)): (i) a form letter of
transmittal; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  



 

5  surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal
duly completed and any other required documents, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, subject to Section 2.1(e) with
respect to any Iron Restricted Stock, in exchange therefor the applicable
amount of Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.1(d)
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(i), and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a surrender of a Certificate representing shares of Iron
Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of Iron under
the name of the Person surrendering such Certificate, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Steel Common Stock may be issued
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if (x) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer to the Person surrendering such
Certificate and requesting such issuance, (y) such Person surrendering such
Certificate and requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Steel Common Stock to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall establish to
the satisfaction of Steel that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, and (z) such Person surrendering such Certificate shall, if
required by Steel, have such Persons signature guaranteed by a bank,
brokerage firm or other financial intermediary that is a member of a
medallion guarantee program. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the applicable consideration set forth in
Section 2.1, without any interest thereon.



(c) No Further Rights in Stock. All Merger Consideration issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Iron Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further
registration of transfer on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Iron Common Stock represented by such
Certificates which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any such Certificates are presented to Steel,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise
provided by law.



(d) Investment of Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Merger Consideration, as directed by Steel, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Steel.



(e) Termination of Exchange Agent. One hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will be terminated as such and
will deliver to Steel any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains
undistributed to the holders of Iron Common Stock, and any holder of Iron
Common Stock that have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Steel for the Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant hereto.



 

6 (f) No Liability. Neither Steel, the Exchange Agent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Iron Common Stock for
any Steel Common Stock or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(g) Withholding of Tax. Steel or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the applicable amount of the Merger Consideration
otherwise issuable to, and any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to, any former holder of Iron
Common Stock such amounts as Steel (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Steel (or any Affiliate thereof)
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Iron
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Steel (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent.



(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate
evidencing shares of Iron Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit setting forth that fact by the
Person claiming such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Steel may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Steel, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate,
Steel shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to such Person the applicable
amount of the Merger Consideration with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.



(i) Distributions With Respect To Unexchanged Iron Common Stock. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made with respect to Steel Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Steel Common Stock
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 until such holder
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law and the provisions
of this Article II, following the surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the shares of Steel Common Stock
issued in exchange for such Certificate, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Steel Common Stock. 



Section 2.3. Treatment of Iron Options and Warrants



(a) Iron Options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase or acquire shares of Iron Common Stock (an "Iron Option") granted
either: (i) under Irons 1993 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Consultant Stock Option
Plan, 1999 Equity Compensation Plan or 2004 Equity Compensation Plan, each as
amended (collectively, the "Iron Stock Option Plans"); or (ii) outside of the
Iron Stock Option Plans for the purchase of a total of 1,147,023 shares of
Iron Common Stock, shall be converted into an option to acquire Steel Common
Stock as provided for in this Section 2.3(a). As of the  



 

7  Effective Time, each Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to,
the terms and conditions of each agreement pursuant to which such Option
was subject as of the Effective Time (including the terms and conditions of
any applicable Iron Stock Option Plan), except that (i) each Option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Steel Common Stock equal to the
product, rounded up to the nearest whole number, of (A) the aggregate number
of shares of Iron Common Stock subject to such Option at the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the exercise price per share of
Steel Common Stock issuable pursuant to each Option shall be equal to the
exercise price per share of Iron Common Stock under such Option at the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. Except for changes to the Options expressly provided for in the
applicable Iron Stock Option Plan by reason of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the assumption and substitution of Options
as provided herein shall not give the holders of such Options additional
benefits or additional (or accelerated) vesting rights which such holders did
not have as of the Effective Time, or relieve the holders of such Options of
any obligations or restrictions applicable to their Options or the shares
obtainable upon exercise of the Options. The adjustment provided for herein
with respect to any Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner that is consistent with
continued treatment of such Options as "incentive stock options" under
Section 424(a) of the Code. The Iron Stock Option Plans shall be assumed by
Steel with respect to all outstanding Options granted under the Iron Stock
Option Plans, and no further options to purchase or acquire shares of Iron
Common Stock or other awards or rights shall be granted under the Iron Stock
Option Plans after the Effective Time. The duration and other terms of the new
options provided for in this Section 2.3(a) shall be the same as the original
Options except that all references to Iron shall be references to Steel.



(b) Iron Warrants. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to
purchase or acquire shares of Iron Common Stock (an "Iron Warrant"), shall be
converted into a warrant to purchase or acquire Steel Common Stock as
provided for in this Section 2.3(b). As of the Effective Time, each Warrant
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the terms and conditions of
each agreement pursuant to which such Warrant was subject as of the Effective
Time, except that (i) each Warrant shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Steel Common Stock equal to the product, rounded up to the
nearest whole number, of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Iron Common
Stock subject to such Warrant at the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the exercise price per share of Steel Common Stock
issuable pursuant to each Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per
share of Iron Common Stock under such Warrant at the Effective Time divided
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Except for
changes to the Warrants expressly provided for in the agreement pursuant to
which such Warrant was subject as of the Effective Time by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the assumption and
substitution of Warrants as provided herein shall not give the holders of such
Warrants additional benefits or additional rights which such holders did not
have as of the Effective Time, or relieve the holders of such Warrants of any
obligations or restrictions applicable to their Warrants or the shares
obtainable upon exercise of the Warrants. Steel hereby  



 

8  assumes, as of the Effective Time, the obligations under each Iron Warrant
and the obligations to deliver to the holder thereof such shares of Steel
Common Stock as such holder is entitled to acquire pursuant hereto and
thereto. The duration and other terms of the new warrants provided for in this
Section 2.3(b) shall be the same as the original Warrants except that all
references to Iron shall be references to Steel.



(c) Actions Relating to Options and Warrants. Steel shall take all corporate
action reasonably necessary (x) to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Steel Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Options and
the Warrants and (y) to ensure that the shares of Steel Common Stock issued
pursuant to the exercise of the Options and the Warrants are registered under
the Securities Act, listed on the Nasdaq and may be freely transferred by the
holders thereof, subject to Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act. Iron and
Steel shall take all reasonably necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.3, including using reasonable efforts to obtain
from each Option and Warrant holder any consent or agreement that may be
deemed necessary in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3.



(d) Form S-8. Without limiting the foregoing, Steel shall (i) file with the
SEC on the Closing Date a post-effective amendment on Form S-8 to
the Registration Statement with respect to the shares of Steel Common Stock
subject to Options granted under or outside the Iron Stock Option Plans (as
converted pursuant to Section 2.3(a)); and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as
amended by such post-effective amendment (and maintain the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Options
remain outstanding.



Section 2.4. Transfer Books



At the Effective Time, the transfer books of Iron with respect to all
shares of capital stock and other securities of Iron shall be closed and no
further registration of transfers of such shares of capital stock shall
thereafter be made on the records of Iron.



Section 2.5. Certain Adjustments



If between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Iron Common Stock or of Steel Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities shall be declared thereon with a record
date within such period, the Exchange Ratio (and any other references herein
to a price per share of Steel Common Stock) shall be adjusted accordingly to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend.



 

9 Section 2.6. No Dissenters Rights



In accordance with Section 910 of New York Law, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of shares of Iron Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.

the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise file any registration
statement under any such statute covering, any of its currently outstanding
capital stock or other securities or any of its capital stock or other

Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
financial statements of Iron included in the Iron SEC Reports, including each
Iron SEC Report filed after the date hereof until the Closing, complied in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The financial
statements, including all related notes and schedules, contained in the Iron

Report filed after the date hereof until the Closing, present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Iron and the Iron  



 

13  Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of Iron and the Iron Subsidiaries for the
periods indicated, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be noted therein) and subject
in the case of interim financial statements to normal year-end adjustments and
preparation of footnotes. 



(c) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Iron has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14

in SOX. Iron does not have and has not arranged any outstanding extensions
of credit to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section

provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Irons
assets.



(e) Irons disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Iron in the Iron SEC Reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Irons management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Iron required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. 



(f) Iron is not a party to, or does not have any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar contract
(including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Iron, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Iron in Iron SEC Reports.



 

(g) Since January 1, 2003, Iron has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) significant deficiency or (y) material weakness
in Irons internal control over financial reporting. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight board, as in effect on the date hereof.

Iron, (iii) any entry by Iron or any of the Iron Subsidiaries into, or any
amendment of, any employment, deferred compensation, consulting, severance,
change of control, termination or indemnification agreement with any such
current or former director, officer or employee or (iv) any amendment to, or
modification of, any option outstanding under the Iron Stock Option Plans, (e)
any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Iron, (f) any
change in accounting methods, principles or practices by Iron materially
affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses, except insofar as may have
been required by a change in GAAP, or (g) made any material Tax election by
Iron or any Iron Subsidiary inconsistent with past practices or any settlement
or compromise of any material income Tax liability.



Section 3.8. Absence Of Litigation



Except as set forth in Irons SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the
date of this Agreement, there are (a) no claims, actions, suits,
investigations, or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Iron,
threatened against Iron or any Iron Subsidiary before any court,

body, domestic or foreign, that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Iron or that challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin, alter or
materially delay the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) no judgments,
decrees, injunctions or orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against Iron or any Iron Subsidiary that would be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Iron.

franchises, authorizations and approvals from all Governmental Entities (the
"Iron Permits") which are necessary  



 

15  for the operation of the businesses of Iron and the Iron Subsidiaries as
presently conducted and for Iron and the Iron Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate their respective properties, except where the failure to have any
such permits, licenses or approvals would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Iron. Iron and the Iron Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the Iron Permits and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, except where the failure so to comply would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Iron.



Section 3.10. Unlawful Payments

Section 3.14. Employee Benefit Plans



(a) Section 3.14 of Irons Schedule of Exceptions sets forth a list of all
Iron Benefit Plans. Each Iron Benefit Plan (as defined below) intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified and no
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected by Iron to result in the
revocation of any such determination. Each Iron Benefit Plan is in compliance
with the applicable terms, if any, of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and the Code and any other applicable laws,
rules and regulations, except where the non-compliance, breach or violation of
which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Iron. Neither Iron or
any Iron Controlled Common Entity nor any fiduciary of a Iron Benefit Plan has
engaged in any "prohibited transaction" as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
in Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any Iron Benefit Plan.



 

17 (b) Neither Iron nor any Iron Controlled Common Entity has ever maintained
sponsored or contributed to a defined benefit pension plan subject to Section
412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA.

under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Benefit Plan currently in effect would be an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No such
Person is entitled to receive any additional payment from Iron, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Person (a "Parachute Gross Up Payment") which would
result in imposition of the excise tax of Section 4999(a) of the Code on such
Person. The Board of Directors of Iron has not granted to any officer,
director or employee of Iron or any Iron Subsidiary any right to receive any
Parachute Gross Up Payment. Section 3.14(e) of Irons Schedule of Exceptions

its political subdivisions.

(b) Iron agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the
officers and directors of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that
it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Representatives"),
not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect
to (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving Iron, (ii) any purchase of an equity interest or
interests representing, in the aggregate, an amount equal to or greater than a
15% voting or economic interest in Iron or (iii) any purchase of assets,
securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater
than 15% of the consolidated assets of Iron and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (any such inquiry, proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"). Iron further agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, have any discussions with, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or engage in any
negotiations with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt by any
Person other than Steel and Merger Sub to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Iron or its Board of Directors from (I) complying with its disclosure
obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal; provided, further, however, that if such disclosure
has the substantive effect of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Iron
Directors Recommendation in a manner adverse to Steel or the adoption of
this Agreement by the Board of Directors of Iron, Steel shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 9.1(f)(i); and (II) at any
time prior to, but not after, Iron Stockholder Approval, (A) providing
information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors
of Iron receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement (excluding standstill provisions) on customary
terms; (B) engaging in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors of Iron receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement (excluding standstill provisions) on customary terms; or (C)
recommending or agreeing to recommend such an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Iron, if and only to the extent
that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the
Board of Directors of Iron determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors
to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (y) in the case
referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of Iron
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel), taking into account all aspects of the proposal, the
likelihood of obtaining financing, and the Person making the proposal, that
such Acquisition Proposal,  



 

50  if consummated, is more favorable, from a financial point of view (taking
into account the likelihood of consummation), to Irons stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.9(d); and (z) in the case of clause (C), Steel
shall have had written notice of Irons intention to take the action referred
to in clause (C) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") at least ten Business Days
prior to the taking of such action by Iron and Iron shall have complied with
the provisions of Section 7.9(d); provided, that any more favorable
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (y) above must involve at least 50%
of the assets or equity securities of Iron rather than the 15% used in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal (any such more favorable Acquisition
Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal").



(c) Iron will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
transaction with Iron to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of
such Person by or on behalf of Iron or any of its Subsidiaries. Iron agrees
that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 7.9.



(d) Iron agrees that it will notify Steel as promptly as practicable (and, in
any event, within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal are received
by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer
and thereafter shall keep Steel informed, on a current basis, on the status
and terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions
or negotiations. Iron agrees that (i) during the ten Business Day period
prior to its taking any action referred to in clause (II)(C) of the proviso in
Section 7.9(b) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, Iron and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Steel and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Steel and (ii) Iron may take any
such action with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was a Superior
Proposal only if such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal in light of any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to which Steel shall have agreed prior to the
expiration of such ten Business Day period; provided that no such Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal for purposes of this
Section 7.9 if (A) Steel shall have agreed to revisions to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) the Board of Directors of Iron shall
not have reasonably determined in good faith that such transactions as so
revised are not substantially equivalent to or better than such Acquisition
Proposal, from a financial point of view (taking into account the likelihood
of consummation), to the shareholders of Iron. Iron agrees that it will
deliver to Steel a new Notice of Superior Proposal with respect to each
Acquisition Proposal that has been materially revised or modified prior to
taking any action to recommend or agreeing to recommend such Acquisition
Proposal to the shareholders of Iron and that a new ten  



 

51  Business Day period shall commence, for purposes of this Section 7.9(d),
with respect to each such materially revised or modified Acquisition Proposal
from the time Steel receives a Notice of Superior Proposal with respect
thereto. Iron also agrees to provide any information to Steel that it is
providing to another Person pursuant to this Section 7.9 at the same time it
provides it to such other Person.

failure of such party to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with by it pursuant to this Agreement which would be likely to result in any
condition to the obligations of such party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. No delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.12 will cure any breach of any
representation or warranty, covenant, condition or agreement of such party
contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



Section 7.13. Tax Treatment



None of the parties shall take, cause to be taken or omit to take any action
which would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties will report the
Merger as such a reorganization for purposes of all Tax Returns and other
filings.



Section 7.14. Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)



Steel shall cause its Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation to adopt prior to the Effective Time such resolutions as

in Sections 7.3 and 9.5) shall become void and of no effect with no liability
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers or other
Representatives); provided, however, except as otherwise provided herein, no

(b) In the event that



(i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (but substituting 40% for the

shall have been made to Iron or any of its Subsidiaries or its shareholders
and shall have become publicly known or any Person shall have publicly

termination fee of $5,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") and shall promptly, but
in no event later than two days after being notified of such by Steel, pay
all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent, incurred by Steel or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by wire transfer of same day
funds; provided, however, that (except in circumstances where Steel has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f)(i)) no
Termination Fee shall be payable to Steel pursuant to clause (i) of this
paragraph (b) unless and until (I) any Person (other than Steel) (an
"Acquiring Party") has acquired, by purchase, sale, assignment, lease,
transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any series of related
transactions within 15 months of such termination, a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding securities of Iron or all or substantially all of the

acquisition within 15 months of such termination or (II) there has

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Steel and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Iron fails to promptly pay any
amount payable pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Steel or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Iron, Iron shall pay to Steel or Merger Sub their costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest thereon at the prime rate of Wachovia Bank in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Except as provided in Section 9.2(a), the
parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that full payment is made by Iron
of all amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), such payment shall be
Steels and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under
this Agreement.



 

59 (c) In the event that a Steel Business Combination Proposal (as hereinafter
defined) shall have been made to Steel or any of its Subsidiaries or its
stockholders and shall have become publicly known or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Steel
Business Combination Proposal (and such Steel Business Combination Proposal
or publicly announced intention shall not have been withdrawn at the time of
the Steel Stockholders Meeting) and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Steel or Iron pursuant to Section 9.1(e) or by Iron pursuant to clause
(iii) of Section 9.1(g), then Steel shall promptly, but in no event later than
two days after the date of such termination, pay Iron the Termination Fee and
shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after being notified of

assignment, lease, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any series of
related transactions within 15 months of such termination, a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding securities of Steel or all or substantially
all of the assets of Steel or shall have entered into an agreement with Steel
for such an acquisition within 15 months of such termination or (ii) there
has been consummated a merger, consolidation or similar business combination
between Steel or one of its Subsidiaries and an Acquiring Party within such 15
month period. Steel acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Iron would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Steel fails to promptly pay any amount payable
pursuant to this Section 9.2(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Iron
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Steel, Steel shall pay to
Iron its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest thereon at the prime rate of Wachovia Bank
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Except as provided
in Section 9.2(a), the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that full
payment is made by Steel pursuant to this Section 9.2(c), such payment shall
be Irons sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.



"Steel Business Combination Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect
to (x) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving Steel, (y) any purchase of an equity interest or
interests representing, in the aggregate, an amount equal to or greater than a
40% voting or economic interest in Steel or (z) any purchase of
assets, securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or
greater than 40% of the consolidated assets of Steel and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.



Section 9.3. Amendment



This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of Iron or the stockholders of Steel no amendment may be made
which by law or rule of Nasdaq  



 

60  requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto.



Section 9.4. Extension; Waiver

 



At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other
party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
