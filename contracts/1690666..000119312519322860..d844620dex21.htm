for the Merger Consideration. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time,
Holdco shall, and TWOLF and XRAY shall cause Holdco to, deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
TWOLF Common Stock and the holders of shares of XRAY Common Stock evidence of
shares of Holdco Common Stock representing the aggregate amount of shares of
Holdco Common Stock sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration (such
shares, together any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
hereinafter, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ out of the
Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (an " _XRAY Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (an " _XRAY Book-
Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of XRAY Common Stock, as applicable, and to each holder of
record of a certificate (a " _TWOLF Certificate_ " and, together with an XRAY
Certificate, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _TWOLF Book-Entry
Share_ " and, together with an XRAY Book-Entry Share, a " _Book-Entry Share,_

loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the

and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and

 Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Holdco, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of Holdco Common
Stock and/or cash, as applicable, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_, and the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion
of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a
person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration of such Merger Consideration that the surrendered Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such
registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Holdco Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares of Holdco Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_, in each
case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_. Subject to the effect of applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there
shall be paid to the holder of shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Holdco Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_
and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Holdco
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in XRAY Common Stock and TWOLF Common
Stock_. All shares of Holdco Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of XRAY Common Stock
or TWOLF Common Stock, as applicable, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of
Holdco to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by XRAY or TWOLF, as applicable, on such shares of XRAY Common Stock or TWOLF
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the XRAY Surviving Corporation of the
shares of XRAY Common Stock, or the TWOLF Surviving Corporation of the shares
of TWOLF Common Stock, that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to Holdco or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article_ __ _ III_,
except as otherwise provided by law.

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Holdco.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of TWOLF Common Stock converted pursuant to either Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holdco Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of Holdco Common Stock
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Holdco for issuance to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of full
shares of Holdco Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the " _Excess
Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall
sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the
manner provided herein.

 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account
all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_.

 

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(a)_ that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Holdco, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall
thereafter be entitled to look only to Holdco for payment of their claim for
any shares of Holdco Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Holdco Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Holdco
Common Stock.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of XRAY, TWOLF, Holdco, XRAY Merger Sub, the XRAY
Surviving Corporation, TWOLF Merger Sub, the TWOLF Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash,
any shares of Holdco Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Holdco Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to
Holdco Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, any such
shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Holdco, _provided_ ,
that no losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable

 



10

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 to former holders of shares of XRAY Common Stock or shares of TWOLF Common
Stock pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Holdco.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Body,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Holdco or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of XRAY Common Stock or shares of TWOLF Common Stock, as applicable,
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco
Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdco
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 Section 3.4 _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of XRAY Common Stock or TWOLF
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares, dividend payable in stock or other
securities or other similar transaction, the XRAY Exchange Ratio and the
TWOLF Exchange Ratio and related provisions, without duplication, shall be
appropriately adjusted to proportionately reflect such reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange, dividend or other similar
transaction and to provide to the holders of XRAY Common Stock and TWOLF
Common Stock or XRAY Equity Awards and TWOLF Equity Awards the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange, dividend
or other similar transaction.

 

Section 3.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors or managers, as applicable, of Holdco, TWOLF
Surviving Corporation and XRAY Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of XRAY or TWOLF, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf thereof, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in Holdco, any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by Holdco as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties

board is an Acquisition Proposal, include the information with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal that is specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (it being understood and agreed that the
delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change

cause its respective financial advisor and legal counsel to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with the other party in good faith to make such amendments

discretion, proposes to make such amendments (it being understood and agreed
(x) that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is
any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any

and (C) the other party does not make, within the Notice Period, a proposal
that is determined by its board of directors (after consultation with such
partys financial advisor and outside counsel), to cause the Intervening Event
to no longer form the basis for its board to effect a Change in Board
Recommendation or cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
that the public announcement of a Superior

 Proposal Notice that such party determines that it is required to make under
applicable Law shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change in Board
Recommendation, unless and until it shall have failed promptly after the end
of the Notice Period to publicly announce that it (A) was recommending the
Transactions and (B) has determined that such other Acquisition Proposal
(taking into account (1) any modifications or adjustments made to the

adjustments made to such other Acquisition Proposal) was not a Superior
Proposal and was rejecting such Superior Proposal.

no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules
or disclosures would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(a) upon becoming aware that any material representation or warranty made

be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case,
such that any condition to the Mergers would fail to be satisfied; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of such party set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the other party to consummate the Mergers,
or the remedies available to the parties hereto, and _provided_ , _further_ ,

correct only as of such particular date or with respect to such specific
period), except in the case of this clause (ii), where the failure to be so
true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications or limitations
as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar language, other than
with respect to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_) would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on XRAY. TWOLF shall have received a certificate validly executed and
signed on behalf of the XRAY by its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer certifying that this condition has been satisfied.

 

(c) _No XRAY Material Adverse Effect_. Since the Agreement Date, there
shall not have occurred and be continuing any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to XRAY.

(d) _Tax Opinion_. TWOLF shall have received an opinion of Cooley LLP, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to TWOLF, dated the date of the
Effective Time, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, for United States
federal income tax purposes the XRAY Merger and the TWOLF Merger will each
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
or, alternatively, as a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition of gain and
loss under Section 351 of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Cooley LLP may
receive and rely upon representations contained in certificates of XRAY,
Holdco and TWOLF and others, and the parties hereto agree to provide Cooley
LLP with such certificates as it may reasonably request in connection with
rendering its opinion.

 

Section 8.4 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the respective Effective
Time, each of TWOLF and XRAY shall deliver to Holdco a duly executed
certificate (a " _FIRPTA Certificate_ "), dated not more than thirty (30) days
prior

 to the respective Effective Time, certifying that (A) TWOLF and XRAY,
respectively, are not and in the preceding five (5) year period have never
been a "United States real property holding corporation" as defined in
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder or (B) none of the Equity Interests in TWOLF or XRAY, respectively,
constitutes a "United States real property interest" as defined in Section
897(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, which
certificate shall be in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in a form reasonably satisfactory to Holdco;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if TWOLF or XRAY fails to provide the FIRPTA
Certificate, the transactions shall nonetheless close and Holdco shall
withhold from the TWOLF Merger Consideration and/or the XRAY Merger
Consideration and pay over to the appropriate taxing authorities the amount
required to be withheld under Section 1445 of the Code as determined by
Holdco.

Section 10.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
