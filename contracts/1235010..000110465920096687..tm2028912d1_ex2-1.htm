discretion, elect to do so;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of
this _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_ and (y) in no
event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination

pay for, all Company Shares that are validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that with respect to Company

been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger

Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid
net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any withholding

to demand and have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all respects with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_, but instead such holder will be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
holder of Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or
otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be
Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and
less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_,
upon surrender of such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section

that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be accelerated in full and (ii) each such Company RSU Award shall be canceled
as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive, subject to
_Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_by_ (y) the Offer Price (the " _RSU Consideration_"). Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation to, pay through Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or the
applicable Subsidiary's payroll to the former holders of Company RSU Awards
who are current or former employees of the Company, the applicable RSU
Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days

payable under this _Section 3.7_ relate to a Company RSU Award that
is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or
is subject to any agreement, plan or arrangement that requires any delay in
payment of such amounts beyond the time period provided by this _Section
3.7_, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary shall
pay such amounts at the earliest time, as applicable, permitted under the
terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such
Company RSU Award and that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code (after taking into account actions taken under Treas. Reg.
1-409A-3(j)(4)(ix)), but no earlier than as promptly as is practicable
following such time (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after such time).

  



  

   

-25-

 



    



  

(g) _Company ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board or the compensation committee of the Company Board (the "
_Company Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall take all actions
necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP to terminate the Company
ESPP as of the day immediately prior to the Closing, contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing, and to otherwise effectuate the treatment of
the Company ESPP as contemplated by this _Section 3.7(g)_. From and after
the date hereof, (i) no offering or purchase period shall be continued or
commenced under the Company ESPP, except for any offering or purchase period
under the Company ESPP that is in effect on the date hereof (the " _Final
Offering Period_ "); (ii) no new participants may elect to participate in the
Company ESPP during the Final Offering Period and (iii) no participant may
increase their payroll deductions with respect to the Final Offering Period.
The final exercise date under the Company ESPP shall be the earlier of (A) the
normal exercise date for the Final Offering Period and (B) two (2) Business
Days prior to the Acceptance Time (such earlier date, the " _Final Exercise
Date_ "). Each Company ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under
the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase Company Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, which Company
Shares shall be treated in accordance with _Section 3.7(a)(i)_, and as
promptly as practicable following the purchase of Company Shares in
accordance with this sentence, the Company shall return to each participant
the funds, if any, that remain in such participant's account after such
purchase. To the extent required by the Company ESPP, the Company shall
provide notice to all Company ESPP participants describing the treatment of
the Company ESPP pursuant to this _Section 3.7(g)_.

  



  

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the Company
Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to permit the treatment of
the Company Options and Company RSU Awards pursuant to this _Section 3.7_.
The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that from
and after the Effective Time neither Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or Company RSU Awards or in
respect of the Company ESPP.

  



  

3.8 _Payment for Company Securities; Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
designate and appoint a nationally recognized, reputable U.S. bank or
trust company (the identity of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior
approval of the Company) to act as depository agent for the Company
Stockholders entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_
and as the paying agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ (the " _Paying Agent_
").

  



  

   

-26-

 



    



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for
payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which Company Stockholders are entitled under this _Article III_ (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Option Consideration or RSU
Consideration). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as
reasonably directed by Parent (such cash amount being referred to herein as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with _Section 3.8(g)_. No investment or losses thereon shall
affect the consideration to which holders of Company Shares are entitled
under this _Article III _and to the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full
the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article III_, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by
this _Article III_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than as expressly provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii) non-
certificated Company Shares represented in book-entry form (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and Parent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to
_Section 3.8(e)_), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such holder's
transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to _Section
3.8(e)_), and the Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith be
canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares (other than Certificates and Uncertificated Shares representing any
Canceled Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_, payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

  



  

   

-27-

 



    



  

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that
such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for
any such Taxes in the circumstances described in this _Section 3.8(d)_.

  



  

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Shares, Company Options and Company RSU
Awards such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Laws. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to
obtain any affidavits, certificates and other documents as may reasonably be
expected to afford to the Company and its stockholders reduction of or relief
from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted and withheld, each such payor shall take all action as may be
necessary to ensure any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts deducted and
withheld under this Agreement that are timely and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
Company Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

-28-

 



    



  

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect
thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any Company
Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of
the Merger Consideration, payable in respect of the Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

  



  

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and
after the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and (a) each holder
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares or Canceled Company Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.8_ (or, for the avoidance of
doubt and without duplication, any consideration that remains payable with
respect to any Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the Offer), (b) each
holder of any Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights specified in _Section 3.7(c)_ and (c) each
holder of any Canceled Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto. The Merger Consideration or the consideration specified in
_Section 3.7(c)_, as applicable, paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed, and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

  



  

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, in the form and substance as reasonably requested
by the Paying Agent, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a customary
indemnity (which may include the posting of a bond in a reasonable amount)
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise the Surviving Corporation's right, title or interest in,
to or under, or duty or obligation with respect to, any of the
property, rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any of the debts or
Liabilities, of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assumptions and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under, or duty or obligation with respect to, such property,
rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any such debts or Liabilities,
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

of incorporation. The Company is in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, with all corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to conduct its business as currently conducted,

ability of the Company to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company's
Subsidiaries is in good standing under the laws of its respective
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization (to the extent such concepts are

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign corporation or other entity authorized to do business in each of the
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under
lease by it or the nature or conduct of the business transacted by it makes

in any Subsidiary of the Company (together with the shares of capital stock
of the Subsidiaries of the Company, the " _Subsidiary Securities_ ").

  



  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

4.4 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its covenants and obligations hereunder and, assuming
the accuracy of the representation set forth in the first sentence of
_Section 5.6 _and, with respect to the Merger, subject to the satisfaction
of the Minimum Condition following the Acceptance Time, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and, assuming the accuracy of the representation set
forth in the first sentence of _Section 5.6_ and, with respect to
the Merger, subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition following
the Acceptance Time, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and, except for the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, no additional corporate proceedings or actions on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally,
and (b) is subject to general principles of equity (collectively, the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ "). The Company Board, at a meeting duly called

interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, for
the Company to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution and

its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby upon the

subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend
that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares
to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

4.5 _Stockholder Approval_. Following the Acceptance Time,
assuming satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, no vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Company's capital stock will be required in order to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock that, absent
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law
and the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger.

  



  

4.6 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations hereunder nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (a) violate or conflict with or result
in any breach of any provision of the respective certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or other similar governing documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) require any Permit of, or filing with or notification to,
any Governmental Authority except (i) as may be required under the HSR Act,
(ii) the applicable requirements of any federal or state securities Laws,
including compliance with the Exchange Act, (iii) the filing and recordation
of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, including the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or (iv) the applicable requirements of NASDAQ, (c) violate, conflict
with, or result in a breach of any provisions of, or require any notice or
Consent or result in a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration or any event that, with the giving
of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default or
give rise to any such right) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, or result in
the loss of a material benefit or rights under any such Contract, (d) result
in (or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
result in) the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Permitted Liens or a Lien created by
Parent or Merger Sub) or (e) violate any Law or Order applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound, except, in the case of clauses (b) through
(e), inclusive, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment or supplement),
none of the Company SEC Reports contained, and any Company SEC Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation is made as to
the accuracy of any financial projections or forward-looking statements or
the completeness of any information filed or furnished by the Company to the
SEC solely for the purposes of complying with Regulation FD promulgated under
the Exchange Act. The Company has made available to Parent all correspondence

_provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may (i) in response to the receipt of a written, _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof that did not result from
a material breach of _Section 6.2(a)_ or the occurrence an Intervening
Event, effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or, (ii) in response to
the receipt of a written, _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal after the date

determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor(s)
and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (C) the Company provides written notice to Parent at least

Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ of its

in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the basis for a
Company Board Recommendation Change or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ and (E) no earlier than the end of such

(after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel),
after considering any proposed amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent during such five (5) Business Day
period, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (and, in the case of receipt of such

Superior Proposal). Following delivery of a Change of

event of any change to the financial terms (including any change to the
amount or form of consideration payable) or other material revision to the
terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide a

that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall not permit the Company Board
to make a Company Board Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted
by _Section 6.3(c)_.

other hand, shall promptly inform the other of any substantive communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Authority relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any

thereof shall receive a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions

an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all substantive meetings and conference calls
with any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate
with one another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings
not contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be made, and whether any
other Consents not contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be
obtained, from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make
any filings, furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to
obtain timely any such Consents that the parties determine are required to be
made or obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Affiliates shall after the date of this Agreement acquire or agree to
acquire any rights, business, Person or division thereof (by way of license,
merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, other business

agree to enter into any joint venture, collaboration, or other similar
arrangement, in each case that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair Parent's ability to obtain the timely
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.3 _Merger_. Following the Acceptance Time, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the
Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the Company Stockholders, in accordance
with Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and shall
not permit and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, take any
action that could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the
Merger.

  



  

7.4 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on
the one hand, nor Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or
shall cause its Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release or
make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of NASDAQ or any other applicable stock exchange on which
Parent may be listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
or parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of
any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 7.4_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by any party with respect to the matters addressed in
_Sections 6.2 _or _6.3_ ; _provided, further_ , that the parties shall not be
required by this _Section 7.4_ to provide such opportunity to comment to the
other party in the event of any dispute between the parties relating to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) to the extent the content of any
press release or other announcement has been approved and made in accordance
with this _Section 7.4_, no separate approval shall be required in respect
of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent
press release or other announcement, and (b) each party may, without
complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, and make
internal announcements to employees, in each case, to the extent that such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties or approved by
the parties, and otherwise in compliance with this _Section 7.4_, and
provided that such public statements do not reveal material nonpublic
information regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-
takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approval and take such
action as necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

7.6 _Access_.  During the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly to Parent all
information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request, including with respect to the
Company Programs, to the extent reasonably available, and keep Parent
reasonably apprised as to any material developments with respect to the
Company Programs; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the Company may restrict
or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent
that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii)
the Company in good faith determines access to such documents or information
would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to
such documents or information or (iii) such documents or information relate
to the evaluation or negotiation of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or, subject to _Section 6.2_ and _Section
6.3_, an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, and (b) in each case, any
physical access to the properties, information and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries may be limited to the extent the Company in good faith
determines, in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, that such access
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health and safety of any
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries. In the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on (x) clauses (a)(i) or
(a)(ii) of the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate any applicable Law or waive such a privilege, and (y) clause (b) of
the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide
access to Parent and its Representatives in a way that the Company in good
faith determines would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health
and safety of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
7.6_ (1) shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or create
a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (2) shall be subject to the Company's reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent
or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 7.6_. Nothing in this
_Section 7.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals or opinions that are
not readily available.

7.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including "derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c)
under the Exchange Act)) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any director or executive officer of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

7.8 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time shall (and, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the
indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 7.8(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, in each case, true, accurate and complete copies of which
have been made available to Parent and as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, in favor of any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' current
or former directors and officers or any individual serving or who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), and (ii)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational document
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation
and/or bylaws (and/or other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses with respect
to any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time that are no less favorable than the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and
during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified
Persons except as required by applicable Law or as provided below.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section
7.8(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any
threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding,
investigation, arbitration or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (each an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ "), to
the extent such Indemnified Proceeding arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Person's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employment benefit
plan) or by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was serving
at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as such (including as a
fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan) of another Person (in
each case with respect to actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions
that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final
disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding for which indemnification may be
sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified
Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with any such Indemnified Proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Person during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or, if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the DandO Tail Policy is
not available at an aggregate cost not greater than the amount set forth on
_Section 7.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, then, prior to the
Closing, the Company shall obtain as much comparable insurance as can be
obtained at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the amount set forth on
_Section 7.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) has been made against such Indemnified Person, the provisions
of this _Section 7.8_ shall continue in effect with respect to such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation until the final
disposition thereof.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
any of its successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 7.8_.

  



  

(f) This  _Section 7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by,
the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives,
and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Person without the written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person. The rights provided under this _Section 7.8_ shall not
be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Person
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

  



  

7.9 _Employee Matters._

  



  

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Plans, as applicable, will occur as
of the Acceptance Time or the Closing, as applicable. Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor the Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) provide to each Continuing Employee (i) a base salary or wage
rate, as applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunity that, in each case, is
not less than the base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and annual
bonus opportunity, respectively, provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits that are at
least as favorable to the Continuing Employee as those provided under _Section
7.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) other compensation and
benefits that are, taken as a whole, substantially comparable in the
aggregate to either, at Parent's election, (A) such other compensation and
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, defined benefit pensions or
post-employment health or welfare benefits, and retention, change in control
or other one-off payments or benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) such other compensation and
benefits provided to similarly situated new hires (but subject to _Section
7.9(c)_) of Parent and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
expressly understood and agreed that any decreases in annual base salary or
wage rate as a result of COVID-19 that are consistent with and proportionate
to any broad-based salary or wage rate decrease implemented after the Closing
for other similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates shall not
constitute a breach or violation of this _Section 7.9(b)_.

  



  

   

-68-

 



    



  

(c) To the extent that a Plan or any other employee benefit plan
or other compensation or severance arrangement of the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (together, the
" _New Plans_ ") is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (i) for purposes of vesting (but not eligibility or
benefit accrual) under Parent's defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for
purposes of eligibility and benefit accrual for vacation under Parent's
vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility to participate in any
health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-employment
health or post-employment welfare plan) and vesting and eligibility to
participate in the Parent 401(k) Plans and (iv) unless covered under another
arrangement with or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for
eligibility to participate and benefit accrual purposes under Parent's
severance plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
credited to the extent that (A) such service is not taken into account under
the analogous Plans before the Effective Time; or (B) it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to) ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan
will be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
to the extent they did not apply to the Continuing Employee under the
corresponding Old Plan and any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during any unfinished portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins will be given full credit
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any
action to the extent Parent determines that such action could reasonably be
expected to make a Continuing Employee (or eligible dependent) ineligible for
a benefit (for example, if credit for past contributions would make the
Continuing Employee ineligible for health savings account contributions from
Parent).

  



  

(d) If the Closing Date occurs before the date annual bonuses for
fiscal year 2020 are paid under any Plan that is an annual cash
incentive compensation plan or arrangement (a " _2020 Bonus Plan_ "), Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) continue to operate such 2020
Bonus Plan in good faith and in the ordinary course of business consistent in
all material respects with the Company's past practice, and (ii) pay annual
bonuses for 2020 under the 2020 Bonus Plan in amounts not less than those set
forth on _Section 7.9(d)(ii)(A)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_2020 Bonuses_ "), and subject to the terms and conditions set forth on such
schedule, at substantially the same time as annual bonuses have
historically been paid by the Company (but in no event later than March 15,
2021) to each Continuing Employee participating in a 2020 Bonus Plan (A) who
remains employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates on
the date of payment or (B) whose employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates is terminated before such payment under the
circumstances described on _Section 7.9(d)(ii)(B)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(e) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt
resolutions, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
terminating, contingent on the Closing and effective as of the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _401(k) Plan Termination
Date_"), any Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "
_401(k) Plan_"). Prior to the 401(k) Plan Termination Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence of resolutions adopted by the
Company Board authorizing such termination. If the Company is directed by
Parent to terminate a 401(k) Plan pursuant to this _Section 7.9(e)_, Parent
shall establish or designate one or more 401(k) Plans (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plans_") in which the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate
as of the Effective Time and which shall allow each Continuing Employee to
make a "direct rollover" to the Parent 401(k) Plan in which such Continuing

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent with
a copy of any such intended communication and a reasonable period of time to

treated as set forth on _Section 7.9(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) constitute an
amendment to any Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement, (iii) require Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Plan
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time or (iv) create any obligation of the parties to any Person
(other than the other parties hereto) with respect to any employee
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement.
The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement. No Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this _Section 7.9_, and no provision of this _Section 7.9_
shall create such rights in any such Persons.

  



  

7.10 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub

Parent of any Legal Proceeding commenced after the date hereof against the
Company and/or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company
Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding any such Legal Proceeding. Subject to execution
of a customary joint defense agreement, and except if the Company Board has
made a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding, or participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of any such Legal Proceeding. The Company
may not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of such Legal
Proceeding against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to
this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby without
Parent's prior written consent.

  



  

7.12 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the other parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all

necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement any
agreement, plan, program, arrangement or understanding entered into or
established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or on behalf of its
officers, directors or employees, in each case, at or prior to the Expiration
Time, including any amendment or modification thereto, and (b) satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d) under the

notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Person
alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such Consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or (ii) if
it obtains Knowledge of any breach by such party of its representations,
warranties and covenants hereunder that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to lead to the failure of any condition to
the other party's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 7.14_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any
party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions to
the Offer (or cause any such conditions to fail to be satisfied) or give rise
to any right of Parent to terminate under _Article IX_.

  



  

7.15 _Tax _ _Returns_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Pre-Closing Tax Returns prior to the Closing Date in a

as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained herein or in any

by Merger Sub) shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any delay in

10.8 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and/or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled (without proof of
actual damages or otherwise or posting or securing any bond) to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by the other
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not
to oppose the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance on
the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity.

  



  

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including any claims or
causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other process in any action or proceeding relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section 10.2 _or in
such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this
_Section 10.10_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process
in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a
