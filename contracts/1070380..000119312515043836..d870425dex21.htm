with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements contained herein, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows.

 



5 ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) _Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

(b) _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier and validly terminated in
accordance with _ARTICLE VI_ , the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall will be held by electronic exchange of documents ( _provided_ that if
the Company and Parent mutually agree to a physical closing then the Closing
take place at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, Four Embarcadero Center,
Suite 3800, San Francisco, California, 94111, or at such other location as
Parent and the Company agree), at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the third (3rd)
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (by the party having the benefit
of such condition) of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE V_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions); _provided_ , that
the Closing shall not occur prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the date
hereof without Parents prior written consent. The date on which the Closing
occurs is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

(d) _Effective Time_. A certificate of merger in customary form and substance
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be executed by the Company and, at the
Closing, delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for
filing in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

(e) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by
Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time, and without any further
action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, at the Effective Time:

 

(i) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall become the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation except that all references to Merger Sub shall be
automatically amended and shall become references to the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL; and

 

(ii) the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except that all
references to Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become
references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided
by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation and such bylaws.

 



6 (f) _Directors and Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent and the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall take all
necessary action to:

(i) cause the members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be, effective as of the Effective Time,
appointed as the sole members of the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation;
and

 

(ii) cause the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be, effective as of the Effective Time, appointed as the sole officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed
and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

1.2 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any party hereto, the holders of any securities of
the Company or Merger Sub, or any other Person:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than the Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting
Shares, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to
and in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. All Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in this _Section 1.2_ shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 1.3_, without interest.

 

(b) _Treatment of Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is
owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (including any shares of Common
Stock held by the Company in its treasury) or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub (in each case, other than Shares held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries on behalf of third parties) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of capital stock of
Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to

 



7  the outstanding Shares occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Effective Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of any
class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are
based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices
therefor) affected thereby, including the Per Share Merger Consideration,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change; _provided_ , that nothing
in this _Section 1.2(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to the Common Stock that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

 

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to assert
appraisal rights properly demands appraisal of Shares held by such holder in
accordance with, and complies with all conditions and obligations of, Section
262 of the DGCL, including that such perfected appraisal rights are
not effectively withdrawn or lost with respect to such Shares, each
Dissenting Share held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any such demands received by the Company, including any
stockholders notice of their intent to demand payment pursuant to the DGCL
that the Company receives, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with
the obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or
demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. If any Dissenting Stockholder
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the right to seek appraisal
rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall
immediately be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of such Shares as if such Shares never had been
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof,
at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or
times specified in _Section 1.3(b)_, following the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section 1.3(b)_, the amount of cash
to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under _Section
1.2(a)_ as if such Shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash
shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable
to such holder pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_).

1.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall
enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to each
of them) with a United States bank or trust company or other mutually agreed
financial institution to act as a paying agent with respect to this Agreement
(the " _Paying Agent_ "). Promptly upon the Effective Time (and in any event
on the same Business Day as the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit
of holders of the Shares, cash in United States dollars sufficient to pay the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

 



8  Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_") pursuant to this _ARTICLE I_  (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. Parent also shall deliver to the Company at
the Effective Time funds sufficient for the Company to make the payments
required to be made pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and to pay all associated costs
and expenses of the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of
indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith).

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 3 Business
Days) after the Effective Time, to the extent not previously delivered, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.1_, a letter of transmittal (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form as agreed to between the Company
and Parent prior to the Closing. The Letter of Transmittal shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 1.3(h)_) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may agree. The Letter of Transmittal shall be
accompanied by instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration.

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery (or,
if later, after the Effective Time) to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 1.3(h)_)
or Book-Entry Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of
an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documentation required hereby, the holder of record of such Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 1.3(h)_)
or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 1.3(h)_)
or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any
required withholding of Taxes). The foregoing payment shall be made via check
or wire transfer of immediately available funds, at each such holders
election as specified in the Letter of Transmittal. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Per Share Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in
accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Share.

 



9 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for transfer, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Share shall be
given a copy of the Letter of Transmittal and instructed to comply with the
instructions in the Letter of Transmittal in order to receive the cash to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE I_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to _Section
1.3(b)_ is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that any such Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by Parent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of
Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this _Section
1.3_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
their claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares in accordance with this _Section
1.3_.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 1.3_, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_
that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the United States government or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amount payable pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided
herein. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent promptly to pay the Per
Share Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares entitled thereto (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if any
Share ceases to be a Dissenting Share), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments.

 



10 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such document to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if determined by
Parent or the Paying Agent in their sole discretion, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed document the amount of the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger

1.4  _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and

any Shares such amounts in cash as Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such payments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid
to such Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.5 _Treatment of Company Options; Company RSU Awards and Company Cash
Payment Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue thereof and without any further action by
the parties hereto or the holders thereof, the portion of each Company Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is vested
(including any vesting that occurs through acceleration or otherwise in
connection with or as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the portion that is vested, a " _Vested
Company Option_ ")), shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from the Company an amount in cash equal
to (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Vested Company Option
and (ii) the total number of Shares then subject to such Vested Company
Option, without interest, less (B) such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law with respect to the payment of the amount described in clause
(A) (the " _Option Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if the
exercise price per Share of any such Vested Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option
shall be cancelled for no consideration. The Company shall pay to each holder
of Vested Company Options the Option Consideration, if any (through the
Companys or a Company Subsidiarys payroll system, or the Companys or a
Company Subsidiarys equity award administrator, as may be applicable and in
accordance with the Companys payroll practices including where applicable its
practices for service providers located outside of the United States), as soon
as administratively practicable following the Effective Time but in no event
(1) later than the first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date after

 



11  the Closing if such payroll date occurs at least three (3) days after the
Closing Date and (2) later than the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll
date after the Closing if the first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date
occurs less than three (3) days after the Closing Date.

(ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue thereof and without any further action
by the parties hereto or the holders thereof, the portion of each Company
Option that is listed on _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
is unvested shall be treated as set forth on _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(iii) At the Effective Time, the portion of each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested
Company Option and that is not described on _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled for
no consideration.

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company
Options.

 

(b) _Company RSU Awards_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue thereof and without any further action by
the parties hereto or the holders thereof, the portion of each Company RSU
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
vested and not settled (including any vesting that occurs through acceleration
or otherwise in connection with or as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such portion, a " _Vested
Company RSU Award_ ")) shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from the Company an amount in cash equal
to (A) the product of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) the
total number of Shares then subject to such Vested Company RSU Award, without
interest, less (B) such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law with
respect to the payment of the amount described in clause (A) (the " _RSU
Consideration_ "). The Company shall pay to each holder of a Vested Company
RSU Award the RSU Consideration, if any, described in the immediately
preceding sentence (through the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys payroll
system, or the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys equity award administrator,
as may be applicable and in accordance with the Companys payroll practices
for service providers located outside of the United States) as soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time but in no event (1)
later than the first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing
if such payroll date occurs at least three (3) days after the Closing Date and
(2) later than the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll date after the
Closing if the first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date occurs less than
three (3) days after the Closing Date.

(ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue thereof and without any further action
by the parties hereto or the holders thereof, the portion of each Company RSU
Award that is set forth on _Section 1.5(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
is unvested shall be treated as set forth on _Section 1.5(b)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



12 (iii) At the Effective Time, the portion of each Company RSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested
Company RSU Award and that is not described on _Section 1.5(b)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled for
no consideration.

 

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company
RSU Awards.

 

(c) Company Cash Payment Awards.

 

(i) The Company generally has not granted equity awards to its service
providers for an extended period of time prior to the date of this Agreement
due to the pending restatement, but the Company has in many instances
contemplated that it would grant such awards to service providers in the
future and in some cases such arrangements have been documented in offer
letters or other documentation. A complete and accurate schedule of all such
awards contemplated to be awarded by the Company (a " _Synthetic Option_ " or
a " _Synthetic RSU_ " as the case may be), the exercise price, if applicable,
and the vested and unvested portions thereof is set forth in _Section
1.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company has approved cash payment awards ("
_Cash Payment Awards_ ") in replacement of such Synthetic Options and
Synthetic RSUs (the form of such Cash Payment Awards is included in _Section
1.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) with the payments to be made
thereunder being contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or another similar transaction) and certain
other conditions, for such current and former service providers, as further
described in such _Section 1.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
Cash Payment Awards provide for payment to the recipient from and after the
Effective Time in respect of the portion of such Cash Payment Award that is
vested as of the Effective Time based on the service period of such service
provider (including any vesting that occurs through acceleration or otherwise
in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such portion, a " _Vested Cash Payment Award_
")) as follows:

(A) the amount of payment in respect of each Vested Cash Payment Award is
based on the terms of the award originally contemplated to be granted to such
service provider (and for the avoidance of doubt, there will be no Cash
Payment Award in respect of any Synthetic Option the exercise price of which,
as of such Synthetic Options notional grant date, is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Merger Consideration);

(B) payment to the recipient in respect of each Vested Cash Payment Award is
conditioned on the recipient entering into an agreement with the Company that
acknowledges, among other things, that such Cash Payment Award is in lieu of
all previously promised but ungranted equity awards to the recipient, and
provides a waiver of any and all claims in favor of Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company) with respect to ungranted options, expired options,
and ungranted restricted stock unit awards of the Company (whether vested or
unvested), in form and substance mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Company; and

 



13 (C) subject to the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, each
Vested Cash Payment Award that is eligible for payment to the recipient shall
be converted into the right to receive from the Company the cash value of such
award less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law with respect to such
payment (the " _Vested Cash Payment Award Consideration_ "). The Company shall
pay the Vested Cash Payment Consideration as soon as administratively
practicable following the Effective Time but in no event (1) later than the
first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing if such payroll
date occurs at least three (3) days after the Closing Date and (2) later than
the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing if the
first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll date occurs less than three (3) days
after the Closing Date.

(ii) At the Effective Time, without any further action by the parties hereto
or the holders thereof, the portion of each Cash Payment Award that is set
forth on _Section 1.5(c)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and that is
not a Vested Cash Payment Award shall be treated as set forth on _Section
1.5(c)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(iii) At the Effective Time, without any further action by the parties hereto
or the holders thereof, the portion of each Cash Payment Award that is not a
Vested Cash Payment Award and that is not described on _Section 1.5(c)(ii_)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, as of the Effective Time, be
canceled for no consideration.

 

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all further actions
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, Company RSU
Awards and Cash Payment Awards in accordance with the treatment contemplated
by this _Section 1.5_ (including obtaining any required approval of the
Company Board or its compensation committee).

 

(d) Promptly upon the Effective Time (and in any event on the same Business
Day as the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Company or the Companys payroll system administrative
agent or a Company Subsidiarys payroll system administrative agent, or the
Companys or a Company Subsidiarys equity award administrator, as may be
applicable and in accordance with the Companys payroll practices including
its practices for service providers located outside of the United States, cash
in United States dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 1.5.

1.6 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

the applicability of such disclosure to a section or subsection of this
Agreement is reasonably apparent on its face), (ii) as disclosed in
the letter, dated as of the date hereof, from the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (subject to _Section

Except as disclosed in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from the Parent and Merger Sub to the Company (the " _Parent Disclosure

warrant to the Company as follows:

3.1  _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and
(to the extent applicable) in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite company power and
authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where
the failure to be in good standing or to have such power and authority would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
registered, qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such registration,
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy
of the Parent Organizational Documents, as currently in effect, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of such documents.

3.2 _Corporate Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite limited liability company
or corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by the board of directors of Parent and the board of
directors of Merger Sub. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company,
this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

(b) There is no vote of the holders of capital stock of Parent necessary to
approve this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger that has not been
obtained.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions do

action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Entity, other than
(i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger, (ii) the filing of the pre-merger
notification report under the HSR Act and the requirements of any foreign
Antitrust Laws set forth on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ , (iii) compliance with the

securities or blue sky laws and (v) the other consents and/or notices set

clauses (i) through (v), the " _Parent Approvals_ "), and other than any
consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the
failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Assuming that the Parent Approvals are received, satisfied, fulfilled
and/or complied with, as applicable, the execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions will not (i) conflict with, violate or breach
any provision of, the organizational or governing documents of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene or conflict with or violate any provision
of any Applicable Law or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
a benefit under any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default,
termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.3 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment of any Governmental Entity
outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by
any Governmental Entity involving, Parent or any of its Affiliates that would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.4 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any
contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled
to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote (or not vote) to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or
(ii) agrees to vote against any Superior Company Proposal.

3.5 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



36 3.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the executed commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto) from TC Lending, LLC and the other applicable
lenders contemplated thereby (the " _Debt Commitment Parties_ ") together with
any related fee letters (which copies of the fee letters may be redacted for
any fee amounts, market flex provisions and other customary provisions so long
as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the conditionality,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing), engagement
letters, exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other
agreements (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " and attached to
this Agreement as _Exhibit A_ ), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, the Debt Commitment Parties have committed to lend
the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub or another wholly owned Affiliate
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters for the purpose of funding the
Transactions (together with any substitute debt financing pursuant to
_Section 4.13(c)_, the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) the executed equity
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ " and attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_ , and together with
the Debt Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from the
Investors pursuant to which the Investors have committed to invest, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that
the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof.

(b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect, except as permitted by this
Agreement. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Investors and Merger Sub and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar Applicable Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and general equitable principles. Except as set forth in the
Financing Commitments, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments to which
Parent, Merger Sub, Investors or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party. As of the date hereof, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise
result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be
unavailable. As of the date hereof, and assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely
basis or that any part of the Financing will not be made available to Parent
at the Closing. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Parent and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, the
proceeds from the Equity Financing when funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents
and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_
and any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and the payment of all
associated costs and expenses of the Transactions (including any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub 

 



37  or the Company required in connection therewith). There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments.

3.7 _Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company the Guarantees of the Investors,
dated as of the date hereof. Each Guaranty is in full force and effect and is
a valid and binding obligation of the Investor party thereto, enforceable
against such Investor in accordance with its terms. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Investors under the Guarantees.

 

3.8 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the authorized
share capital of Merger Sub consists of one hundred (100) shares, $0.01 par
value per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof
and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities
or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and other Transactions.

 

3.9 _Beneficial Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, including
through any intermediary or pursuant to any option, swap or derivatives
contract or other arrangement) any direct or indirect interest in (i) any
shares of Common Stock, (ii) except pursuant to this Agreement, any rights to
acquire any Common Stock, or (iii) any other direct or indirect interest in
any such security or the right to profit from or vote such security including
any synthetic security, option, derivatives contract, swap or other
arrangement. None of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates, or any of their
"affiliates" or "associates," is, or at any time during the last three years
has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company (as such terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).

3.10 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Investors is entering into
the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is Solvent as of the date hereof and each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the
Transactions, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration and the payment of all other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, and
assuming that (i) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been prepared by them in good faith based upon
assumptions that were, and continue to be, reasonable and (ii) the
representations and warranties in _Article II_ are true and correct in all
material respects, be Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As
used in this _Section 3.10_, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to a
particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the property, at a fair
valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each
of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries has not incurred, or believed or reasonably
should have believed that it would 

 



38  incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature or
become due, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries has sufficient
capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this
_Section 3.10_, " _debt_ " means any liability on a claim, and " _claim_ "
means any (a) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (b) any
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives
rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.

 

3.11 _Management Agreements_. There are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements, obligations or understandings (in each case whether
written or oral) between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Company
(including relating to compensation and retention of the Companys
management), the Transactions or the operations of the Company after the
Effective Time.

 

3.12 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, as of the date hereof, they
and their Representatives (a) have received access to such books and records,
facilities, properties, premises, equipment, contracts and other assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries which they and their Representatives, as of the

any information concerning the Company provided by or on behalf of the Company
or otherwise, and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation
or warranty except for those expressly set forth in _ARTICLE II_ , (ii) no
Person has been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make
any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, and if made, such
representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as
having been authorized by such entity and (iii) any estimate, projection,
prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or any
other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Representatives, including any materials or information made
available in the electronic and physical data rooms in connection with
the Transactions, via confidential information memorandum, in connection with
presentations by the Companys management or otherwise, are not and shall not
be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless and to the
extent any such materials or information is the subject of any express
representation or warranty set forth in _ARTICLE II_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent review and
analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and in making its determination to proceed
with the Transactions, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely on its
own independent review and analysis and the covenants, representations and
warranties of the Company contained in _ARTICLE II_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.12 will limit any remedy the Company may

other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate any of the Transactions or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of any of the Transactions; (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the
Transactions.

 

4.3 _Control of the Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the

respective operations.

4.4 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to
_Section 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

(a) The Company shall use reasonable diligence to take all action necessary
under all Applicable Laws and the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to prepare a proxy statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders with the mailing
to occur promptly after the date hereof but in no event later than forty-five
(45) days after the date hereof (subject to such further extensions as may be
necessary to comply with Applicable Law). Subject to _Section 4.7_, the
Company Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement or
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion therein. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct any
material omissions therein. If at any time prior to receipt of the vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ "), there shall be discovered any error or
occur any event that should be corrected or set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and
disseminate its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the
Proxy Statement prior to its being mailed to the stockholders of the Company
and shall provide Parent and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement, and, in any case, shall

suggested thereto by Parent.

 



43 (b) In performing its obligations pursuant to Section 4.4(a) above, the
Company shall take all action necessary under all Applicable Laws and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws (1) to establish a record
date for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at the Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ") and (2) to call,
give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of the shares of Common Stock
to vote on the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited by the
Company in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in material
compliance with all Applicable Laws. The adoption of this Agreement and the
annual election of directors (as well as any adjournment or other procedural
proposals or matters incidental to any of the foregoing) shall be the only
matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of
the Company at the Stockholders Meeting without the prior consent of Parent.
The Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting (i) if the
Company determines in good faith that it is necessary or advisable under
Applicable Law in order to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient
time to evaluate any additional information or disclosure in connection with
the matters to be voted on thereat, so long as the Company consults with
Parent in connection with making such determination, (ii) if as of the time
for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting, (iii) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, (iv) to a date not later than five (5) Business Days following any
date on which the Company and Parent have agreed to improvements to the terms
of the Transactions proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 4.7(d)_, and (v)
otherwise with the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed so long as the purpose of such requested consent is not
inconsistent with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The
Company shall not otherwise (without Parents prior written consent) adjourn,
postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the
Stockholders Meeting, except to the extent required to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all shares of Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates on the applicable Record Date
to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders
Meeting.

4.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, in the
case of the Company,  _Section 4.7_), the parties hereto will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
Transactions and to cause the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE V_ to be
satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval

 



44  from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger,
(ii) the obtaining of all other necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties in connection with such partys own Contracts, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions (" _Merger Litigation_ "), in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including seeking by litigation or other Legal Proceeding to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out
fully the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall make and not withdraw its respective filings under the
HSR Act and make any other applications and filings as reasonably determined
by Company and Parent under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Entity, including (i) promptly informing the other party of such
inquiry, (ii) consulting in advance, and considering in good faith the other
partys views, before making any presentations or submissions to a
Governmental Entity, (iii) giving the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any substantive meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Entity, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity,
and (iv) supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Entity
with respect to this Agreement.

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent and Company shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain any government clearances or approvals required for closing any of the
Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest
and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents or prohibits
the consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction under any Antitrust
Law. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) negotiate, offer, commit to
or effect, by consent decrees, hold separate orders or otherwise,
restrictions on their respective activities, _provided_ , that such actions
need not be effective prior to the Closing. The parties hereto shall defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent
the Closing by the Outside Date.

 



45 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 4.5_, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be required to, and the Company shall not agree to (without
the consent of Parent, which may be withheld in Parents sole discretion),
negotiate, offer, commit to or effect, by consent decree, order, hold separate
orders or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired by it pursuant hereto or enter into any consent decree, order,
accept any undertaking or condition, or otherwise take or to commit to take
actions that would limit Parents, Merger Subs, the Companys or their
respective Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or ability to
retain, any of their businesses, product lines or assets, in each case in a
manner that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a material and adverse impact on the business of the Company or (after
the Closing) Parent. In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to
(nor will the Company, without Parents consent, which may be withheld at
Parents sole discretion) pay any material fee, penalty or other consideration
to any third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or
agreement.

4.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon reasonable notice, (1) the
Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
representatives, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors (" _Representatives_ ") of Parent and the
Debt Commitment Parties reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive in any
material respect to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties,
employees, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and (2) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to afford Parent and
the Debt Commitment Parties reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive in
any material respect to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the accountants of the
Company, and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested and is reasonably available to the
Company; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Merger Sub or any
Debt Commitment Party if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of
the Company, (i) violate Applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
if the Company does not disclose information in reliance on clause (i) or (ii)
of the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is
withholding such information and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way
that would not violate such Applicable Law or agreement or jeopardize
such privilege. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this
_Section 4.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company hereunder. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries
and the Companys officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate automatically
without any further action on the part of any Person as of the Effective Time,
including any provisions that purport to survive a termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



46 4.7 _Solicitation_.

 

(a) _No Shop Period_. Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 4.7_,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors shall

Company Subsidiary to, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable

or (iii) enter into, continue, conduct, engage or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-

direct its Representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time
at which the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company and
its Representatives may, in response to each (if any) Company Takeover
Proposal made or renewed after the date hereof that does not result from a
breach of this _Section 4.7(a)_, if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel) that
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Company Proposal, (1) provide access to or furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) conduct, engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of a revised Company
Takeover Proposal) with such Person and its Representatives regarding such or
any other Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) _Company Takeover Proposals_. The Company will promptly, and in any event
within one (1) Business Day, provide Parent with (i) an unredacted copy of
the Company Takeover Proposal made in writing (including any financing
commitments), (ii) a written summary of the material terms of any such Company
Takeover Proposal not made in writing (including any financing commitments)
and (iii) all material non-public information regarding the Company that has
not previously been provided to Parent that is provided to any Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Company Takeover Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) and upon the request of Parent shall apprise
Parent of the status of such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 4.7_.

 



47 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
Affiliate thereof) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transaction, any: (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of
securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction in which (A) such Person directly or indirectly acquires, or if
consummated in accordance with its terms would acquire, beneficial ownership
of securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, or (B)
the Company issues equity securities representing more than 20% of the
outstanding Common Stock; (ii) direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer,
or disposition of any assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that

earnings of the Company, or (B) 20% or more of the fair market value of the
consolidated assets of the Company; (iii) liquidation or dissolution of the
Company; or (iv) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions with
such Person if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated
revenues or earnings and Common Stock involved is 20% or more.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means a bona
fide written Company Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition
of Company Takeover Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and legal counsel) is more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the Merger (which the Company
Board may determine on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into account at the time
of determination all relevant circumstances, including the various legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the Company Takeover Proposal, all the
terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the
Person making the Company Takeover Proposal, and the anticipated timing,
conditions and the ability of the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal
to consummate the transactions contemplated by such Company Takeover Proposal
(based upon, among other things, expectation of obtaining required approvals
or any necessary financing)).

(c) _Change of Recommendation_. Neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) change, qualify, withdraw, withhold, or modify (or
propose publicly to change, qualify, withdraw, withhold, or modify) in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions, or the recommendation by the Company Board
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, (B) adopt, approve
or recommend (or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend) any
alternative Company Takeover Proposal or agree to take any such action, or
(C) fail to recommend against any alternative Company Takeover Proposal that
is subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (which failure to
recommend shall be made by means of a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9, if applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) of
such alternative Company Takeover Proposal) (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
or (ii) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or allow the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or 

 



48  enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement relating to, an alternative
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or resolve or agree to take any
such action.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
_Section 4.7(e)_, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Effective
Time (1) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an alternative
Company Takeover Proposal and concurrently cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, if the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor, that
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
or (2) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change following or in response to any
material event, fact or circumstance, or a material development or change in
any facts or circumstances (including any acceleration or deceleration of
existing changes to the extent of the acceleration or deceleration), the
existence, magnitude or consequences of which were not known and were not
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board at or prior to the date hereof
(and not relating to any Company Takeover Proposal, which shall be governed by
the foregoing clause (1)) (such material event, fact, circumstance,
development or change, an " _Intervening Event_ ") if the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, and taking
into account all such factors as the Company Board may deem appropriate, that
the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change and/or termination
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law.

 

(d) _Notice of Change of Recommendation_. No termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, and no Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event, as described in clause (2) of _Section
4.7(c)_, may be made until (i) the Company Board shall have first provided
prior written notice to Parent that, with respect to any such Superior
Company Proposal, it is prepared to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), or, with respect to
any such Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event,
it is prepared to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall
contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Company Proposal, including a copy of the definitive agreements relating
to the Superior Company Proposal in the form to be entered into, a copy of
any financing commitments (including and fee letters redacted to comply with
confidentiality provisions) related thereto and the identity of the Person or
group who made the Superior Company Proposal, or shall describe the
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, as applicable (it being
understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) and (ii) Parent
does not make, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, a
binding proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial
adviser), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Company Proposal
no longer to constitute a Superior Company Proposal or obviate the need for
such Adverse Recommendation Change. Such procedure shall apply to any other
Company Superior Proposal, including any material

 



49  amendment to such Company Superior Proposal, and the Company Board shall be
required to provide to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice, or notice of any
such amendment, and a new five (5) Business Day period, provided, in the case
of any such amendment, that such period shall be reduced to three (3) Business
Days. To the extent applicable, and subject to the limits of the preceding
sentence, if Parent has in good faith proposed to the Company improvements to
the terms of the Transactions during the five (5) or three (3) Business Day
period prior to the Companys terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(ii)_, the Company agrees that, during such five (5) or three (3)
Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives (so long as Parent and its
Representatives are negotiating in good faith) regarding any such
improvements to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent.

(e) _Other Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
_Section 4.7(_e _)_ shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the
Company Board under _Section 4.7(c)_, to the extent applicable to such
disclosure (it being understood that neither any "stop, look and listen"
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, nor any accurate disclosure of factual information
that is required to be made under Applicable Law or in satisfaction of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties, shall be deemed a modification of the
Company Boards approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement).

 

4.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees,
to do the following.

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former, and any person who prior
to the Effective Time becomes one of the, officers, directors, employees and
agents (including fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions with respect to the adoption of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions) and otherwise with respect to the
Transactions to the same extent such Persons are indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries and the
indemnification agreements in existence on the date hereof with any directors
and officers of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and set forth on the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the corresponding provisions in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries in existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after
the Effective Time, any agreement between any Indemnified Party, on the one

 



50  hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses
and shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with the Surviving Corporation
for, and shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with, the
foregoing obligations and all other obligations in this _Section 4.8_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for a non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period through at least six years after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions); _provided_ that the
Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and the Company shall give good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and
_provided_ that the cost payable for such "tail" insurance policy shall not
exceed 250% of the amount per annum the Company paid for coverage for 2015
(which amount is set forth in _Section 4.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) (such maximum amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ ") and if the
cost for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Premium, then the
Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Premium. After the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall take no action to intentionally
interfere with the coverage provided to any of the Companys current directors
or officers under such policies of insurance.

(d) If Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 4.8_ (including this _Section
4.8(d)_).

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 4.8_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under DGCL
or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this  _Section 4.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party without the
consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

4.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or any

 



51  of the Transactions, if the subject matter of such notice or communication
could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
including as to the completion of any of the Transactions, and (b) any notice
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with any material aspect of the Transactions, (c) any Legal
Proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or any of the Transactions that,
if pending on the Agreement Date, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement and any change that would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (d) any breach by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 5.2_
or _Section 5.3_, as applicable, if continuing on the Closing Date.

 

4.10 _Public Announcements_. Except for the Companys initial press release
announcing the Agreement which has been agreed to in advance by the parties
(and except as otherwise contemplated by _Section 4.7)_, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any
such press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other
parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), provided that (A) no such consent shall be necessary (x) to the
extent disclosure is required by Applicable Law or Order, (y) for the Company
to file a copy of this Agreement with the SEC pursuant to a Current Report on
Form 8-K, or (z) for the Company to make available through the Companys
publicly accessible website a copy of this Agreement and the Proxy Statement;
provided, that in any such case the disclosing party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult with the other party prior to such disclosure; and
(B) the Company need not consult with or obtain the consent of Parent in
connection with any press release or public statement issued in connection
with any Company Takeover Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change, in
either case, so long as such press release or public statement is made in
accordance with _Section 4.7_.

 

4.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date of termination of this Agreement: (a) the Company shall promptly
advise Parent in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company or
its directors relating to this Agreement or the Merger or any other Merger
Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any
such litigation; and (b) the Company shall consult with Parent regarding the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any stockholder litigation (to the
extent the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is
not undermined or otherwise adversely affected). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall control the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any such stockholder litigation; _provided_ , however, that
except as set forth on _Section 4.1(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to any stockholder litigation without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

4.12 _Employee Benefits_. For the period commencing at the Effective Time
and concluding on December 31, 2015 (the " _Benefit Period_ "), Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) provide to each service provider of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of 

 



52  immediately prior to the Effective Time who remains or becomes an employee
of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates immediately after the
Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with, during their period of
employment with the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates in the
Benefit Period, an annual rate of base salary or wages, as applicable, and the
cash incentive compensation target amount opportunity that are no less
favorable than the annual rate of base salary or wages, as applicable, and the
cash incentive compensation target amount opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing Employees with employee
benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding any equity-
based compensation) provided to such employees by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the extent disclosed in _Section 2.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company
Benefit Plans. Parent agrees that, during the Benefit Period, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Surviving Corporations employee benefit plans
established following the Closing Date (if any) and any other employee benefit
plans covering the Continuing Employees following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "), to recognize the service of each
Continuing Employee for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
the level of vacation or severance benefits (but not for benefit accrual
purposes under a defined benefit pension plan) under the Post-Closing Plans,
to the extent such service was recognized for the same purpose under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time and such
recognition does not result in the duplication of any benefits. For the
calendar year including the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall be
credited with amounts to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket
maximum or similar requirements under the Post-Closing Plans that provide
medical, dental and other welfare benefits (collectively, the " _Post-Closing
Welfare Plans_ ") to the extent of amounts that were previously credited for
such Continuing Employee for the same purposes under comparable Company
Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits
immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, any waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence
of good health contained in any Post-Closing Welfare Plans that is a group
health plan shall be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees (except
to the extent any such waiting period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or
requirement of show evidence of good health was already in effect with respect
to such employees and had not been satisfied under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which the participant participated or was otherwise eligible
to participate in immediately prior to the Effective Time). As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms (including any right to
amend or terminate), all Company Benefit Plans to the extent disclosed in
_Section 2.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall honor the terms of all works council, labor or collective
bargaining agreements by which the Company or its Subsidiaries are bound that
are in effect as of the Effective Time, each as set forth in _Section 2.11_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
4.12_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall (i) be treated as an amendment or other modification of (or limited the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate) any Company Benefit Plan, Post-Closing Plan, or any other employee
benefit plans or compensation arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
(ii) constitute a guarantee of employment for any employee of the Company or
any of its

 



53  Subsidiaries or confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, or (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and of their Affiliates to amend, modify, or terminate
any benefit plan or compensation plan, policy, or arrangement (or the terms,
including performance targets, thereof). The provisions of this _Section
4.12_ are for the sole benefit of Parent and the Company, and no Continuing
Employee shall have status as a third party beneficiary with respect to any
provision hereof.

4.13  _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain
the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments, including: (i) maintaining in effect the Financing
Commitments, (ii) entering into definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments, which agreements shall be in effect no later than the Closing,
(iii) satisfying, or causing their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives in the Financing Commitments (or definitive agreements entered
into with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters), (iv) complying with any
"flex" contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in the event such "flex"
provisions are exercised in accordance with the terms thereof and (v)
enforcing its rights under the Financing Commitments in the event of a breach
or anticipated breach by the Debt Commitment Parties or the Investors that
materially impedes or delays (or could reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay) the Closing.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitments without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing), other than such
reduction in an amount which would not cause the remaining amount of the
Financing to be insufficient to consummate the Transactions (including the
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_ and any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_, and the payment of
all associated costs and expenses of the Transactions (including any repayment
or refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required
in connection therewith)), impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions under the Financing Commitments
that could be reasonably likely to (i) prevent, materially delay or impair
the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions or
(ii) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt
Financing Commitment solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. Parent shall not release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letters, except for (i) assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of, and only in connection with, the
syndication of the Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters or
(ii) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing
commitments pursuant to  _Section 4.13(c)_.

 



54 (c) In the event that any portion of the Financing (x) becomes unavailable or
(y) could reasonably be expected to become unavailable in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (i) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company and (ii) in the case of subclause (x), Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into financing commitments (if applicable) and definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from alternative financial
institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon terms
and conditions (including pricing) not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent and Merger Sub than those in the Financing Commitments as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. In the event
Parent obtains financing commitments with respect to alternative financing,
(i) the term " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " as used herein shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in
question and the alternative financing commitments to the extent then in
effect, (ii) the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall mean the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), and (iii) the term " _Debt Commitment
Parties_ " as used herein shall also mean the entities providing such
alternative debt financing commitments. The definitive agreements entered
into pursuant to this _Section 4.13(c)_ or _Section 4.13(a)_ are referred to
in this Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_."

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing, nor the completion
of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or any alternative
financing, is a condition to the Closing.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Financing or any alternative financing and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than with respect to any material misstatement
or omission in information provided by Company and its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to Parent in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or in any other written disclosure provided by the Company to Parent for use
in connection with the Financing).

 

(f) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of each amendment, waiver or other modification of the Financing Commitments
and of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing commitment or
agreement promptly upon their execution; _provided_ , _however_ , that copies
of the fee letters may be redacted for any fee amounts, market flex
provisions and other customary provisions (so long as no redaction covers
terms that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing), (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any
material breach or threatened material breach by any party of any of the
Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing
Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Merger
Sub becomes aware or any termination or threatened termination thereof of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (iii) give the Company prompt notice
of each material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to the
Financing Commitments and (iv) otherwise keep the Company reasonably and
promptly informed of the status of its efforts to

 



55  arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing), including by providing
the Company, upon request, with drafts of the definitive agreements or
offering memoranda relating to the Financing a reasonable period of time
prior to their execution or use (subject to any confidentiality limitations or
Applicable Law, and subject to customary confidentiality undertakings).

 

4.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 4.13(a)_, prior to the Closing, the Company shall and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate in connection with the closing of the
Financing, _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including by, at the reasonable request of Parent or Merger Sub, using
commercially reasonable efforts with respect to:

 

(i) furnishing, or causing to be furnished to, Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt
Commitment Parties (1) the financial statements related to the Company and
its Subsidiaries attached to _Section 2.6_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (2) for each quarterly period completed prior to forty-six (46) days

and similar documents reasonably and customarily required in connection with
the Debt Financing (including providing customary authorization and
management representation letters and provided that any such bank information
memoranda and similar documents shall contain disclosure reflecting the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor under the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date and shall not require any financial
statements other than as required pursuant to clause (i) above);

 

(iv) assisting Parent in the preparation of pro forma financial statements and
financial information (of a type and form customarily included in a

the same can be given in good faith, a customary certificate of the chief

 



56  financial officer or person performing similar functions of the Company at
Closing solely on behalf of the Company and not in such persons individual
capacity with respect to solvency matters) (provided that the effectiveness
of such agreement and documents with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be conditioned upon, or shall become operative on or after,
the Effective Time);

 

(vi) assisting Parent to cause any syndication efforts to benefit from the
existing lending relationships of the Company;

 

(vii) providing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
customary documentation and other information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries requested by Parent or the Commitment Parties in connection with
the Debt Financing and required under applicable "know your customer"
sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations; and

 

(viii) providing such other pertinent and customary information (the only
required financial information shall be as required pursuant to the preceding
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) above), regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent to consummate the Debt
Financing;

 

 _provided_ , that the actions contemplated in the foregoing clauses do not
(A) involve any binding commitment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which commitment is not conditioned on the Closing and does not terminate
without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon the
termination of this Agreement, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited
or restricted under Applicable Law or is legally privileged; _provided_ that
the Company shall notify Parent if any such information is being withheld on
such basis, (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any

basis, (D) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or
approve any Financing or purchase agreement for the Financing prior to the
Effective Time, or (E) impose on the officers, directors, employees or agents

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement in
connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing) prior to the
Effective Time (other than executing customary authorization letters and
management representation letters pursuant to _Section 4.14(a)(v)_ above and
other than liabilities and obligations for), or pay any expenses prior to the
Effective Time that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set forth in
this  _Section 4.14_, (ii) no officer or Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver any certificate or

extent any such action results in, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, personal liability to such officer or Representative, (iii) the board of
directors of the Company shall not be required to approve any financing or
agreements related thereto prior to the Effective Time, (iv) all information,
documentation, statements, data

 



57  and reports provided by, or caused to be provided by, the Company, may be so
provided subject to the Restatement and the Restatement-Related Events, and in
no event shall the Company be required to provide pro forma financial
statements or adjustments or projections (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall be required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Parent and Merger Sub in preparing pro forma financial statements and
financial information as required pursuant to _Section 4.14(a)(iv)_ above),
and (v) nothing in this _Section 4.14_ shall require the cooperation of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the extent
it would cause any condition to Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise
cause a breach of this Agreement. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company pursuant to this  _Section 4.14_ shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent and the Debt Commitment Parties shall be permitted to disclose
such information prior to the termination of this Agreement, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings in connection with the syndication of
the Debt Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters to
prospective lenders or participants thereof. The Company hereby consents to
the use of all logos of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Debt Financing so long as such logos (i) are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
Company, its business and products or the Merger. Parent shall promptly, upon
request of the Company, reimburse the Company for any expenses and costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with the
Companys or its Affiliates or Representatives obligations or actions under
this _Section 4.14_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the
case of a knowing and intentional material breach by the Company of this
Section 4.14., no breach of this _Section 4.14_ by the Company or any of its
Representatives shall serve as a basis, in whole or in part, for the closing
condition in _Section 5.2(b)_ of this Agreement to fail to be satisfied.

4.15 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall (a) cause Merger Sub to perform each of its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, or incur or
guarantee any indebtedness or make any investments, other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

4.16 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
ensure that the dispositions and cancellations of equity securities of the
Company (including any derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by
any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

4.17  _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to the
Transactions, the Company and the members of the Board shall grant such
approvals and use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to eliminate the
effects of such Takeover Laws on the Transactions.

 



58 4.18 _Restatement and Related Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary:

(a) each of the parties hereto (A) acknowledges the pendency and ongoing
nature of the Restatement and the Restatement-Related Events and risks to the
Company and its business arising from such matters, and (B) agrees that the
intention of the parties is that the Parent Related Parties are entering into
this Agreement with the intention to assume the risk of the Restatement and
the Restatement-Related Events from and after the date of this Agreement, and
accordingly the parties agree that:

 

(i) the Transactions have been priced and negotiated based upon such
assumption of risk, and none of such matters, nor any consequences arising
from the Restatement or the Restatement-Related Events or any related actions
or inactions by the Company or any other Person, are or will be (x) a basis
for any claims or causes of action by any of the Parent Related Parties,
including a basis for renegotiation of the terms of this Agreement by any of
the Parent Related Parties; (y) conditions to the obligations of any of the
Parent Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, including
obligations to complete any of the Transactions or any actions required to
make it possible to complete the Transactions, or (z) a basis for any of the
Parent Related Parties not completing such actions or Transactions or
terminating this Agreement or otherwise for not consummating any of such
actions, including the Transactions;

(ii) that all representations and warranties made by the Company, and
all actions required to be taken (or omitted to be taken) by the Company,
pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to and qualified by the
Restatement and the Restatement-Related Events; and

 

(iii) subject to _Section 4.18(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company shall consult with Parent regarding the taking of any further
action in connection with completing the Restatement;

(b) in furtherance of, and without limiting the generality of, the foregoing,
each of the parties acknowledges that the Company is subject to an enforcement
order by the SEC providing that, pursuant to Section 12(J) of the Exchange
Act, the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act will be
suspended or revoked (the " _Deregistration_ ") on or after February 15, 2015
(the " _Restatement Deadline_ ") if by the Restatement Deadline the Company
has not completed and filed with the SEC the restatement of the financial
statements required to be filed by it pursuant to the Exchange Act, and
accordingly the parties hereto (w) acknowledge that they remain bound to
complete the Transactions in accordance with this Agreement regardless of
the inability of the Company to complete the filings with the SEC required to
be made prior to the Restatement Deadlines; (x) acknowledge that the rules of
the SEC under the Exchange Act applicable to the Company and the Common Stock
will largely be inapplicable to the Company following such Deregistration;
(y) agree that they shall take all actions reasonably necessary to complete
the Transactions (including the Merger) as promptly as practicable following

which shall be determined as of that specified date), (iii) _Sections
2.2(a),_ _(b)_ and the first sentence of _Section 2.2(d)_ (Capitalization)

amount required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger to increase
by greater than a net total amount of $500,000 (in determining such $500,000
increased cost amount, there shall be a credit or reduction against increased
costs resulting from inaccuracies in such representations and warranties for
(x) any changes in capitalization matters that occur between the Agreement
Date and the Closing Date that are favorable to the Parent such as the
lapsing of any outstanding

 



60  equity or contemplated synthetic equity award as a result of an employee who
elects to terminate service prior to the Closing Date and (y) any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties that are favorable to the Parent), and
(iv) _ARTICLE II_ (other than the representations and warranties listed in

without regard to any "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications contained in them, on and as of the Agreement Date and on and
as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of such date (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of
which shall be determined as of that specified date), except where the failure
of any such representation or warranty to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

(b) the Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects
with the covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with
or to perform under the Agreement prior to the Closing Date;

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received certificates executed on behalf
of the Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of
the Company, certifying that the conditions set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ ,
_5.2(b)_ and _5.2(d)_ have been satisfied;

 

(d) since the Agreement Date, there shall not have occurred a Company Material

as though made on and as of such date (except for representations and

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all material
respects with any covenant or obligation that Parent or Merger Sub is
required to comply with or to perform under the Agreement prior to the Closing
Date; and

by an officer of Parent, certifying that the conditions set forth in _Sections

61 5.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 5.1_ or _Section
5.2_ to be satisfied if Parent or Merger Sub breached or failed to perform any
of their respective covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
and such failure was the primary cause of, or resulted in, either (x) the
failure of the conditions to the obligations of Parent or the Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions to be satisfied prior to such time or (y) the
failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to such time. The
Company may not rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section

failure of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
Transactions to be satisfied prior to such time or (y) the failure of the
Effective Time to have occurred prior to such time.

ARTICLE VI

such termination or (y) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred
prior to such termination;

(ii) if the Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments and

to such Company Takeover Proposal), (D) the Company has materially breached
its obligations under _Section 4.7_, or (E) the Company or the Company Board

(ii) if any of the representations and warranties of the Company shall have
become inaccurate or the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (A) would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ and (B) is not curable or has not been cured before the
earlier of the Outside Date or twenty (20) days following the date the Company
receives written notice of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform; or

(d) by the Company (by written notice to Parent specifying the applicable
provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected):

(i) if any of the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub shall
have become inaccurate or Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed
to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (A) would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions and (B) is not curable or has not
been cured before the earlier of the Outside Date or twenty (20) days
following the date Parent receives written notice of such inaccuracy, breach
or failure to perform;

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to concurrently

has complied in all material respects with the requirements of _Section 4.7_
with respect to such Superior Company Proposal and (C) no termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ shall be effective unless
the Company prior to or concurrently with such termination pays the
Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to _Section _ _6.3(b)_ ; or

 

(iii) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ and _Section
5.2_ shall have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing or have not been
satisfied as a result of breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub),
(B) the Company confirms irrevocably in writing to Parent that, if there are
any unsatisfied conditions in _Section 5.3_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), the
Company is willing to waive any such unsatisfied conditions in _Section
5.3_, and (C) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger
within three (3) Business Days following the later of receipt of the writing
described in clause (B) and the date the Closing should have occurred in
accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_.

 



63 6.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith be terminated and have no further effect, the obligations of
the parties hereto hereunder shall terminate, and there shall be no liability
on the part of any party hereto with respect thereto, except that (x)
_Section 4.13(e)_, the last two sentences of _Section 4.14(b)_, this
_Section 6.2_, _Section 6.3_ and _ARTICLE VII_ (and the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and (y) subject to _Section 6.3_ and _Section 7.5_, nothing in this
Agreement shall not relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from
any liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

6.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.3_ or in _Section
4.13(e)_ or _Section 4.14(b)_, and subject to _Section 6.2_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses,
whether or not any of the Transactions are consummated.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(i)_
or by the Company pursuant to  _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay Parent a fee equal to the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day
funds (x) in the case of a termination described in clause (i), within three
(3) Business Days after such termination and (y) in the case of a termination
described in clause (ii), prior to or concurrently with such termination;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
Parent shall provide the Company with the applicable wire transfer account
information promptly upon request therefor in the event the Termination Fee is
payable.

 

(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(ii)_ (but only if the applicable breach was a consequence of an act or
omission undertaken with the actual knowledge that the taking of, or failure
to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a material
breach of this Agreement) or by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_, (ii) after the Agreement Date
and prior to the time at which a vote is taken on the adoption of this
Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting (or an adjournment or postponement
thereof), a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
(only with respect to a termination pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_ or
_6.1(b)(i)_ ) otherwise communicated to the Company Board and in each
case not withdrawn or abandoned in good faith, and (iii) within twelve (12)
months following the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a Company Takeover
Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds, concurrently with the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal, a
fee equal to the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds;
_provided_ that for purposes of this  _Section 6.3(c)_, all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%".

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Parents rights set forth in _Section 7.5_, (i) Parents receipt of payment
from the Company of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and the other Parent Related

 



64  Parties against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise
and (ii) upon payment of such amount (and any amounts payable to Parent
pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_), none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no
event will the Company Related Parties be liable for monetary damages in
excess of the amount of the Termination Fee (and any amounts payable to the
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_) except for any additional liability of
the Company in the event of a knowing and intentional material breach of
this Agreement by the Company, and (y) while Parent may pursue both a grant
of specific performance in accordance with _Section 7.5_ and the payment of
the Termination Fee under this _Section 6.3_, under no circumstances
shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and money damages, including all or any portion of the Termination
Fee.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
6.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to
this _Section 6.3_ or otherwise due in connection with the termination of
this Agreement and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub
commences an action that results in a final judgment against the Company for
such amount or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay the costs and
expenses (including court costs, attorneys fees and expenses) of Parent and
Merger Sub in connection therewith, together with interest on the amount of
such judgment, from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment, at the U.S. Dollar prime rate of interest as reported by The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date of such payment.

7.3 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of laws, provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the

 



66  State of Delaware, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal
court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, or if such federal court does not have
jurisdiction, any court of the State of Delaware having jurisdiction, in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any Legal Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Legal Proceeding may not
be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall be heard and determined
in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 7.2_
or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support, or permit any of
its Subsidiaries to bring or support, any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any other letter or agreement related to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, New York, whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions
of Section 7.4 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action.

7.4 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING), THE
TRANSACTIONS, OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

7.5 _Remedies; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary and
other legal damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach any such provisions. The parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent any
breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants or obligations under this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
proof of damages or otherwise, and that such rights of specific enforcement
are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without such rights,
neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this
Agreement. To the extent

 



67  any party hereto brings a proceeding to specifically enforce the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
7.5_, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the resolution of such proceeding or (ii) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such proceeding.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to a
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ , the Company
shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent any breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, including Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, and without
limitation of any of the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to enforce
its rights (by litigation or otherwise) as a third-party beneficiary of the
Equity Commitment Letter. Neither the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to this  _Section 7.5_ nor anything else in this _Section 7.5_
shall restrict or limit the Companys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Article VI_ or (before or after any termination)
to pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Guarantees (including monetary damages) that may be available
then or thereafter, and nothing in this _Section 7.5_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall require the Company to institute any proceedings for specific
performance prior to or as a condition to exercising any other right or remedy
(including the pursuit of damages). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any and all remedies herein conferred upon the Company are
cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law
or equity upon the Company, and the exercise by the Company of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(c) Each party hereto further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except those liabilities or
obligations of (i) Parent and Merger Sub to the extent arising out of this
Agreement and (ii) Investors to the extent provided in the Guarantees
and Equity Commitment Letter.

(e) Neither the Company nor or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall
have any rights, claims or causes of action against any of the Financing
Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, this Agreement, or the
Transactions, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Nothing in this Section 7.5(e) shall in any way modify, limit or qualify the
obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters to
each other thereunder.

 



68 7.6 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto; it being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign
the same counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in
PDF format of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in
counterparts or otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will
together constitute one and the same instrument and each counterpart will
constitute an original of this Agreement.

 

7.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , however that Parent or Merger
Sub may assign this Agreement to any of their wholly-owned Affiliates on
terms so as not to adversely affect the rights and remedies of the Company
under this Agreement (including _Section 7.5_ hereof) and,  _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign its rights hereunder for
collateral security purposes to any Financing Source providing Debt Financing
to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
the terms thereof, or to any assignee or assignees of any such Debt Commitment
Party lender or lenders and _provided_ , further, that no such assignment
permitted pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall relieve Parent of
its obligations hereunder.

7.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be
fully separable and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect and shall be interpreted as reasonably necessary to effect
the intent of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger, and, without
limiting the effectiveness of the foregoing, in the event of any illegal, void
or unenforceable provision the parties hereto shall promptly negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement if and to the extent necessary so as to
effect as closely as possible the intent of this Agreement to consummate the
Merger as originally contemplated hereby to the fullest extent possible.

 

7.9 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all Exhibits, and the Company Disclosure
Schedules, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) are
not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company

the approval of the respective Company Board and the board of directors of
Parent; _provided_ , that after any such adoption of this Agreement by the

except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties

delay in exercising any rights under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver
of such right, no single or partial exercise of any right will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right or of any other right, and no waiver
of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or
default of the same or any other provision hereof.

7.11 _Interpretation; Rules of Construction_.

(a) When a reference is made herein to Articles, Sections, subsections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article, Section or subsection of, or
an Exhibit hereto, unless otherwise indicated. Where a reference is made to an
Applicable Law, such reference is to such Applicable Law as amended, modified
or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor Applicable
Law; _provided_ , that for the purposes of the representations and warranties
set forth herein, with respect to any violation or alleged violation of any
law, the reference to such law means such law, regulation, statute,
or provision as in effect at the time of such violation or alleged violation.
The headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation hereof.

 



70 (b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless
the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any gender
include each other gender and neutral forms of such words, (ii) words using
the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder" and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (iv) references
to clauses without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are references
to clauses within the same Section or, if more specific, subsection, (v)
references to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of such
Person and (vi) references from or through any date shall mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. The symbol "$" refers to United States Dollars. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." All
references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated.
The phrases "provided to," "furnished to," "made available to," and phrases of
similar import when used herein with respect to Parent, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall mean that a copy of the information or material
referred to has been posted in the electronic data room set up by the Company
in connection with this Agreement, as of two (2) Business Days prior to the
date hereof through the date hereof. The phrase "ordinary course of business"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words

this Agreement shall be rounded to the 10th decimal place, except in respect
of payments, which shall be rounded to the nearest whole United States cent.

(d) The parties hereto have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Exhibit attached hereto and
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the application of any Applicable Law,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 

(e) Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, the establishment of any
monetary or other quantitative thresholds in any Section of this Agreement
shall not create the presumption of a standard of materiality with respect to
such Section or any other Section hereof.

7.12  _Company Disclosure Schedule; Restatement and Restatement-Related
Events_. The impact or effects of the Restatement or of any Restatement-
Related Event shall be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) each of the Companys representations and warranties and
covenants set forth in this Agreement. Any information contained in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the impact of any
Restatement Related Event shall be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) each of the Companys representations and
warranties (as well as for any covenants that are qualified by the Company

case of any information or disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
relevance of the information

 



71  or disclosure, as an exception to a representation or warranty (or a
disclosure for purposes thereof) would be reasonably apparent on the face of
such information or disclosure. There shall be no implication arising from
the numbering of any sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that the disclosures contained in such provision are limited solely
to constitute an exception to the corresponding portion of the Agreement
or that the failure to qualify a particular sentence or clause in this
Agreement by express reference to a section in the Company Disclosure Schedule
means that such sentence or clause is somehow not qualified by disclosures
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule whose application to such
