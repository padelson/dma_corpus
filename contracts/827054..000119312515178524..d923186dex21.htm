2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

 

(ii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value
per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Interim Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger
Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the
Interim Surviving Corporation.

 

(iii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and extinguished, and upon
the surrender of (A) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Certificates_ ") and (B) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") in the manner provided in  _Section 2.8_
(or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in _Section
2.10_), be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, as set forth below:

(1) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked
pursuant

 



21  to _Section 2.7(f)(vi)_ (each a " _Cash Electing Share_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, subject to
adjustment pursuant to  _Section 2.7(b)_).

(2) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not
revoked pursuant _Section 2.7(f)(vi)_ (each a " _Stock Electing Share_ ", and
together with the Cash Electing Shares, the " _Electing Shares_ ") shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.7(c).

(3) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which no Cash Election
or Stock Election is properly made (or if made, has been revoked) (each, a "
_Non-Electing Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration as determined in accordance with
_Section 2.7(b)_ below and subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.7(c).

 

(b) _Proration_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than
Section 2.7(c), a minimum number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
the Minimum Stock Percentage (as defined below) of the shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such number of shares, the " _Aggregate Stock Number_ ") shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. The " _Minimum Stock
Percentage_ " shall be equal to 42%; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the tax
opinion of Parents counsel referred to in  _Section 7.2(g)_ or the tax
opinion of the Companys counsel referred to in _Section 7.3(e)_ cannot be
rendered as a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy continuity
of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles
relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code (as reasonably
determined by such counsel) taking into account the value of a share of Parent
Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date
and on the Closing Date, then the Minimum Stock Percentage shall be increased
to the minimum extent necessary to enable such tax opinion or opinions to be
rendered (such reduction and increase to be finally calculated and
made immediately preceding the Effective Time).

(ii) If the aggregate number of Stock Electing Shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Stock Election Number_ ") is less than or equal to the Minimum Stock
Percentage of the Aggregate Stock Number (such difference between the Stock
Election Number and the Minimum Stock Percentage of the Aggregate Stock
Number, the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then (x) all Stock Electing Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (y) the
Cash Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be treated in the
following manner:

 



22 (1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of
Non-Electing Shares, then (A) all Cash Electing Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (B) the Non-Electing
Shares of each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number
of Non-Electing Shares that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(I) the number of Non-Electing Shares of such holder by (II) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is
the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such
holders Non-Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and

 

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Shares, then (I) all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration and (II) a number of Cash Electing Shares of
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (I) the number of Cash Electing Shares of such holder by (II)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number
exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares and the denominator of
which is the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares, with the remaining
number of such holders Cash Electing Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 

(iii) If the Stock Election Number is greater than the Minimum Stock
Percentage of the Aggregate Stock Number then all Non-Electing Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

(c) _Aggregate Stock Election Cap_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, including _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, if the aggregate Stock
Consideration would be greater than 35,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Aggregate Stock Election Cap_ ") then (i) all Non-Electing Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, (ii) all
Cash Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and (iii) all Stock Electing Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration
and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Stock Election
Cap and the denominator of which is the aggregate Stock Consideration without
giving effect to the Aggregate Stock Election Cap.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, or any record date for any such purpose shall be established, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



23 (e) _Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Merger, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (i) such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the
Parent Average Closing Price.

 

(f) _Election Procedures_.

 

(i) All elections in accordance with this _Section 2.7_ shall be made on a
form designed for that purpose and mutually acceptable to the Company and
Parent (a " _Form of Election_ ") which will be filed as an exhibit to the
Form S-4 and mailed to the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock
as of the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting or on such other
date as Parent and the Company mutually agree (the " _Form of Election Date_
"). The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders,
the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) who
wishes to make a Cash Election or a Stock Election or a combination of both
for any and all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. The
Company shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may be
reasonably requested by any Person who becomes a holder (or beneficial owner)
of shares of Company Common Stock between the Form of Election Date and the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Date.

(ii) For elections to be effective, (A) with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock represented by Certificates, a Form of Election and a Letter of
Transmittal must be properly completed, signed and actually received by the
Exchange Agent and accompanied by the Certificates representing all the shares
of Company Common Stock as to which such a Form of Election is being made,
duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the
books of the Company (or an affidavit of lost certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.10)_, or (B) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that are held in book-entry form, Parent shall establish procedures for the
delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company (any election that satisfies either (A) or (B), an " _Election_
").

 

(iii) An Election must be received by the Exchange Agent not later than 5:00
p.m. California time on (A) the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting or,
(B) if the Closing Date is more than four (4) Business Days following the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (either of (A) or (B), the " _Election Date_ ") in order to be
effective. Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder has
not, as of 5:00 p.m., California time, on the Election Date, properly
submitted a properly completed Form of Election to the Exchange Agent will be
deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. After a Cash Election or Stock Election is
validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, no further
registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock 

 



24  transfer books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock
Election is properly revoked. In addition, all Forms of Election shall
automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by
Parent and the Company that the Merger has been abandoned.

(iv) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Date at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If
the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall be
subsequently delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall
promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Date.

(v) Subject to the provisions of the agreement entered into with the Exchange
Agent, the Exchange Agent shall have the discretion to determine whether Forms
of Election have been properly completed, signed, and timely submitted or to
disregard defects in forms. Any such determination of Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error. Neither Parent
nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of
any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. Any shares
of Company Common Stock relating to which the record holder is deemed to have
not submitted a valid Election on or prior to the Election Date shall be
deemed to be Non-Electing Shares.

 

(vi) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be (A) changed by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., California time, on the
Election Date, accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of
Election or (B) revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted
the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., California time, on the Election Date. In addition,
Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. If a Cash
Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate, such Certificate shall promptly be
returned to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent.

(vii) The Exchange Agent shall make all the computations contemplated by this
_Section 2.7(b)_, including the determination of the number of Cash Electing
Shares, Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares and, after consultation
with Parent and the Company, all such computations will be conclusive and
binding on the former holders of shares of the Company Common Stock absent
manifest error. The Exchange Agent may, with the agreement of Parent and the
Company, make such reasonable rules as are consistent with this _Section 2.7_
for the implementation of the Elections provided for herein as shall be
necessary or desirable to effect fully such Elections.

 



25 (g) _Company Compensatory Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Compensatory Award then outstanding under any of the Company Plans
shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.11_.

 

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also
act as the agent for the Companys shareholders for the purpose of receiving
and holding their Certificates and Uncertificated Shares and shall obtain no
rights or interests in the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Exchange Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, (i) evidence of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ in book-entry
form sufficient to issue the aggregate Stock Consideration, (ii) by transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration and (iii) by transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount of cash sufficient to make the aggregate payments in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such amount referenced in
clauses (ii) and (iii) together with the evidence of book-entry shares of
Parent Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of shares of
Non-Electing Shares (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
containing customary provisions (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Each holder
of Electing Shares shall have previously completed and delivered to the
Exchange Agent a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section
2.7(f)(ii)_ above. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share,
upon (x) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (y)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. 

 



26  Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts (i) shall be remitted
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Company or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary 

 



27  settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_;
_ provided, however_ , as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Agent shall require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to furnish a bond in form satisfactory to the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed. The value of the bond of indemnity shall be calculated by the
Exchange Agent, based on the value of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates.

2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Company shall take all such lawful and necessary action on behalf of
the Company and Merger Sub.

 

2.12 _Tax Treatment_. The Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto intend
that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute
integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of
reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. Except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, no party hereto shall take any
action that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

ARTICLE III

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article III,_ as set forth in

in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date. The Company
is not in violation of its articles of incorporation or bylaws. The Company

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of

otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interest)
that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Company of such
Subsidiarys business as presently conducted.

(d) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock

clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Subsidiary
Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any
Subsidiary Securities. There are no Contracts of any kind which obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire

3.3 _Authorization_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject in the case of the Merger to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Approval, to consummate the transactions

the representations of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC set forth in

Requisite Shareholder Approval.

 



30  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Sub LLC, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to

Agreement, the Company Board unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement

each Third Party that has executed a confidentiality agreement since the date

consideration of acquiring the Company or any material portion thereof return

reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (A) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party and its Representatives
and/or (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives any information
(including non-public information) relating to the Company or any of its

any "standstill" or similar provision that would prohibit such Third Party
from making any Acquisition Proposal) and containing additional provisions
that expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this _Section
6.1_ (which confidentiality agreement shall be provided to Parent
for informational purposes immediately following the execution and delivery
thereof), _provided_ that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the
Company under California Law, (2) solely with respect to the initial contact
with respect to any Third Party, at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to
engaging or participating in any such discussions or negotiations with, or
furnishing any non-public information to, such Third Party, the Company shall

information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished
or made available by the Company to Parent or any of its Representatives).

the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any action taken by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be a
breach of the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 6.1_ if taken by the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the Company
for all purposes of and under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such action taken by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any member of the Company Board, the Company Boards
financial advisor or outside legal counsel or any Senior Member of Management)
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section 6.1_ by the Company,
unless such action was authorized, directed or knowingly permitted by any
member of the Company Board or any Senior Member of Management.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty-four (24) hours
of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of its receipt of any

including the terms and conditions of, and identity of the Person or group
making, such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

 



70 (e) The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed of the status and

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal immediately prior to providing
notice to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(i)(C)_, or (iii) the disclosure
by the Company of such determination in connection with providing notice to
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(i)(C_), shall be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, if and only if:

 



71 (i) (A) the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of _Section
6.1_ that constitutes Superior Proposal, (B) the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company under California Law, (C)

have (1) given Parent at least four (4) Business Days notice (the " _Notice
Period_ ") of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include
the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement and, to the
extent not included therein, all material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal) and (2) caused its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith any modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, in its discretion,
and (D) Parent shall not have made, within the Notice Period, a written
counteroffer or proposal capable of acceptance that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable, from a financial
point of view, to shareholders of the Company, in their capacity as such, as
such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material revision to
the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision in price, shall
require a new notice pursuant to clause (C) above and (y) there may be more
than one Notice Period); or

 

(ii) (A) a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and not relating in any way to (x) an
Acquisition Proposal or (y) any fluctuation in the market price or trading
volume of the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, in and of itself)
that was not known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (such material
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening
Event_ ") shall have occurred and be continuing, (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company under
California Law, (C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company shall have (1) given Parent at least four (4) Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall include a written explanation of the Company Boards basis and rationale
for proposing to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change) and (2) if
requested by Parent, negotiated with Parent in good faith during such four (4)
Business Day notice period any modifications to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, in its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not have made,
within the four (4) Business Day notice period, a written offer or proposal
capable of acceptance that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and its 

 



72  outside legal counsel, would obviate the need for the Company Board to
effect such Company Board Recommendation Change.

 

(d) The Company shall ensure that any Company Board Recommendation Change (A)
does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board and (B) does not have the effect of causing any Takeover Law to
be applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule

after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with Applicable Law (including the Company
Boards fiduciary duties); _provided_ that, with respect to any statement(s)
made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act,
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act or otherwise related to an Acquisition Proposal, it is
acknowledged and agreed that any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act or any similar communication to shareholders of the Company,
shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change if the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
communication or in connection with such action.

(f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and their respective Affiliates) from
the provisions on "business combinations" contained in any Takeover Law or
(ii) otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such
actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement by the
Company in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

6.3 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. Subject to Applicable Law, the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq and the Companys articles of incorporation and
bylaws, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the " _Company
Shareholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement (and in no event later than forty (40) days after the

shareholders) for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
in accordance with California Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if there
are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to conduct
business at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company may extend the

Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably
determines that such delay is required by Applicable Law, including to comply

to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is necessary
to solicit sufficient proxies to secure the Requisite Shareholder Approval.

shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
in accordance with California Law and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders
Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII,_ the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with this
_Section 6.3_, whether or not (i) the Company Board at any time subsequent to
the date hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or
otherwise shall determine that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that shareholders of the Company reject it or (ii) there occurs the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote
of the shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the Companys shareholders with
respect to the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting. The notice of such
Company Shareholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this
Agreement, a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation that
may become payable to the Companys named executive officers in connection
with the Merger, and a resolution to adjourn the Company Shareholders

matters shall be considered or voted upon at the Company Shareholders Meeting

shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and (ii) a proxy statement of the
Company for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the

"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing with the SEC. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause its respective representatives to, fully cooperate with the other
party hereto and its respective Representatives

 



74  in the preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and
shall furnish the other party hereto with all information concerning it and
its Affiliates as the other party hereto may deem reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto, and each of
Parent and the Company shall provide the other party hereto with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. As promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, the Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its shareholders.

Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 shall not, at the time the Form
S-4 is filed with the SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by either
party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders,
at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, or as of the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. In addition, the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to
Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the
Exchange Act (each, a " _Regulation M-A Filing_") shall not, at the time any
such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



75 (e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) the Company and Parent shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Form S-4, Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document
would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company. The Company and Parent shall each notify the other as promptly
as practicable after the receipt by such party of any written or oral comments
of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Form S-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply
the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the foregoing
filings.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent shall make any necessary filings with
respect to the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that such filings after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Closing
Date, then on the date of such filing) will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit (or will have omitted) to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. In addition, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take all
actions required under any applicable federal or state securities or "Blue
Sky" Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger.

 

(g) Each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to execute and
deliver customary tax representation letters to the Companys and Parents
counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such counsel, in
connection with the delivery of the tax opinions referred to in Section 7.2(g)
and Section 7.3(e).

 

(h) Expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, printing and mailing
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 any other filings with the
SEC and filing fees, if any, shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Company.

 

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and the Company shall use their
reasonable best

 



76  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth
in _Article VII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain all
necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts, Leases
or Company IP Agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger); (iii) obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities, the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any), and (iv) execute or deliver any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
6.5(a),_ as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act (and each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to file such Form within ten (10) Business
Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement), as well as
comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the Antitrust Laws of any
applicable foreign jurisdiction. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings,
(ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, (iii) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition
or merger control authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction, and (iv)
share equally all filing fees and expenses incurred in connection with filings
made in connection with this _Section 6.5(b)_ (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, all fees and expenses payable to any attorneys, accountants
or other advisors incurred in connection with this _Section 6.5(b)_, which
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses). Each party hereto shall
promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of
any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). If any
party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause
to be made, as soon as reasonably 

 



77  practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Subject to Applicable Law, no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence with any
Governmental Entity or its staff with respect to such Antitrust Laws shall be
made by the Company or Parent without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
6.5(a)_, in the event that any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing
for (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their
business or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the shares of
Company Common Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent
or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock (any of the foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

 

6.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and in a manner that does
not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records, Contracts, Permits,
and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided,
however_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Sub LLC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as
amended pursuant to _Section 6.9_)

 



78  shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section
6.6_; and provided further, that the Company shall not conduct or cause to be
conducted any sampling, testing or other invasive investigation of the air,
soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media; and _provided further_ , that the Company shall not be
required to, nor shall the Company be required to cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford access or disclose any information that would (a) violate any
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Third Party, (b)
jeopardize protections afforded the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine or (c) violate
any Applicable Law or Order. In the event that the Company does not provide
access to or disclose information to Parent in reliance on the final proviso
of the preceding sentence, it shall use reasonable best efforts to communicate
such information in a manner that does not result in the violation of any such
obligation, Law or Order or the jeopardy of such protections.

 

6.7 _Notification_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware of
any Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
or any Order, that if existing prior to the date of this Agreement would have
caused the representations and warranties in _Section 3.14_ to be untrue or
inaccurate; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Sub LLC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, (i) the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or
other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material
breach of or material default under any Lease or Material Contract or Company
IP Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
(ii) each party shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or
other communication received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any third
party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of any party to consummate the

 



79  transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to
_Section 6.9_) shall apply to any information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(b)_.

 

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement in; _provided, however_
, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent set forth herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to  _Section 6.9_) shall
apply to any information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_.

6.8 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing after becoming aware of any Legal Proceeding commenced after the
date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of
the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such Legal Proceeding.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation and
shall consider Parents views with respect to such shareholder litigation and
shall not settle any such shareholder litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

6.9  _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 26, 2015 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, effective as of the execution and delivery hereof,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so as to permit
Parent to make any counteroffer or proposal contemplated by _Section 6.2(c)_
or _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ (which deemed amendment shall survive any termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise).

6.10 _Public Disclosure_. Each of the Company and Parent shall not, without
the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or

 



80  conditioned), issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger), except (a) as may be required by Applicable Law or
any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other prior to any such release or public
statement and (b) with regard to a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.11 _Company Compensatory Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each award of
Company Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio
(with the resulting number, rounded down to the nearest whole share). Except
as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed RSUs,
such Assumed RSUs will be subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule
applicable thereto. Any Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof)
that is not an Assumed RSU (each, a " _Cancelled RSU_ ") shall, by virtue of
the Merger and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to
this Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Cancelled RSU, equal to the product of
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average Closing Price (the "
_Cancelled RSU Consideration_ "), except as may otherwise be required by
Section 409A of the Code, in which case such Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall be treated as an Assumed RSU. The holder of each Cancelled RSU shall
receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in no even later than the Companys first full payroll after
the Effective Time) from the Surviving Company, an amount in cash equal to
the Cancelled RSU Consideration.

(b) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or
vests as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(each, a " _Cancelled Option_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and at the
direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be
cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, with respect to each share underlying such Cancelled
Option, equal to the excess,

 



81  if any, of the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent
Average Closing Price, over the per share exercise price of such Cancelled
Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option
Consideration_ "). The holder of each Cancelled Option shall receive at the
Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
no even later than the Companys first full payroll after the Effective Time)
from the Surviving Company, an amount in cash equal to the Option
Consideration. If the exercise price per share of any such Cancelled Option is
equal to or greater than the Cash Consideration, such Company Option shall,
by direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment
of Option Consideration to the holder of a Cancelled Option shall be reduced
by any income or employment tax withholding required under the Code any
Applicable Law or as otherwise agreed by the parties at the time the Company
Option was granted.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each such
Assumed Option shall be subject to substantially the same terms
and conditions as applied to the related Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except
that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such unvested Assumed Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting
number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per share
exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which such Assumed
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). Each Assumed Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following
the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of
the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the
extent such Assumed Option qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the
Effective Time, and, further, that the assumption of Assumed Options pursuant
to this Section shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements
of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, and this _Section 6.11(b)_ will be
construed consistent with this intent.

(c) _Necessary Actions; Form S-8_. The Company shall, at Parents
direction (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), take all
actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
6.11_ under all Company Plans and Company Compensatory Awards or any other
plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required
notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and making any determinations
and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
following the Effective Time), if available

 



82  for use by Parent, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed or converted Company
Compensatory Awards under this _Section 6.11._

6.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides written notice to
the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated. The Company
shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review
and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
As soon as practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall
permit all Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in any 401(k)
plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall
permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account
balance when distributed from any terminated 401(k) plan maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding participant
loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except to the extent
accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified status of
the Parent 401(k) plan, or as may be prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

(b) The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause the
rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to all current
offering periods to terminate on or prior to five (5) days from the date of
this Agreement, and all accumulated payroll deductions allocated to each
participants account as of such date under the Company ESPP shall be
returned to such participant as soon as reasonably practicable following such
date (without interest) and in any event in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP, and (ii) to cause the Company ESPP to terminate effective as of
the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall take all necessary actions so that no new offering is commenced
or made under the Company ESPP on or following the date of this
Agreement. Prior to the date actions must be taken under this _Section
6.12(b)_, and subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent, the
Company shall take all actions necessary give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this  _Section 6.12(b)_.

(c) From and after the Effective Time through December 31, 2015, Parent will
provide, or will cause to be provided, to all Continuing Employees who remain
employed by

 



83  Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, cash compensation as favorable as that
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, with respect to Continuing Employees, Parent
shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, levels of benefits and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual) under each severance, vacation, fringe or other
welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, but in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes
eligible to participate, but solely to the extent permitted by Applicable Law
and to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plans, (i) cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
U.S. group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii)
give each of the Continuing Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out
of pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which
payment has been made. Unused vacation days accrued by Continuing Employees
located in the U.S. under the plans and policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and each Continuing Employee
shall be paid by the Company in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days
that Parent and the Company mutually determine are not permitted by Applicable
Law to be carried over.

 

(e) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation,
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case
no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time (excluding, for
purposes of clarity, any individual severance arrangement entered into by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries with an employee of and any such plan,
program or arrangement required to be maintained by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries by Applicable Law, as disclosed on _Section 6.12(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter). The Company shall provide Parent evidence
that such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent).

(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates to continue any specific benefit plan or
program, or to continue the employment of any specific person. No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any compensation or
benefits on the part of any Continuing Employee or other future, present or
former employee of Parent, the Company or their respective

 



84  Affiliates. _Sections 6.11_ and _6.12_ are intended to be for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in _Sections 6.11_ and
_6.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder or make any employee or other
service provider of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall operate
as an amendment to any benefit plan maintained by the Company or Parent or
their respective Affiliates. Further, Parent, the Company and their respective
Affiliates retain the right to amend or terminate their benefit plans at any
time and from time to time, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and
the terms of such plans.

6.13  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects
the obligations of the Company under its articles of incorporation and bylaws
and its Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) and all agreements for
indemnification (that have been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof),
exculpation of liability or advancement of expenses, in effect as of the
date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current directors, officers or employees or former directors and
officers or any person who becomes a director or officer prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ").

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the
Effective Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Company may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and
amounts no less favorable to such persons than the DandO Insurance, _provided
further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
6.13(b)_, Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount of the
Companys annual premium amounts as of the date hereof (such two hundred
percent (200%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the
Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 6.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter), _provided further_ that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail
Policy_ ") on the DandO

 



85  Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to exceed three hundred percent (300%)
of the Companys annual premium amounts as of the date hereof. In the event
that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail
Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that either the Company or
Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Company shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under the first
sentence of this _Section 6.13(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.13_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a Tail
Policy referred to in _Section 6.13(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such person. Each
of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
