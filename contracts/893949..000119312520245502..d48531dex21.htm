calculation of the Final Purchase Price by an amount of $100,000, but the
Accounting Firm determines that Seller has a valid claim for only $60,000,
then Buyer shall bear sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm and Seller shall bear the other forty percent (40%) of such
fees and expenses.

(c) Within two (2) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Report in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ (including by
failure to timely deliver a Notice of Disagreement):

 

(i) if the Additional Payment Amount is a positive number, then Buyer shall
pay an amount in cash equal to the Additional Payment Amount to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to an account of
Seller designated in writing by Seller to Buyer; or

 

(ii) if the Additional Payment Amount is a negative number, then Seller
shall pay an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of the Additional
Payment Amount to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
U.S. dollars to an account of Buyer designated in writing by Buyer to Seller.

 

For purposes hereof, " _Additional Payment Amount_ " means an amount equal to
the sum of (A) the Final Purchase Price _minus_  (B) the Closing Payment. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Additional Payment Amount may be a negative
number.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding Tax_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller or their agents shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from any amounts
payable or deliverable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld under applicable Law. The party making such deduction or withholding
(or whose agent is to make such withholding) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to first notify the recipient of the payment subject to such deduction
or withholding of its intent to deduct or withhold, together with an
explanation of the legal requirement for such deduction or withholding, and
Seller and Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in good faith
to reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding to the extent
reasonably permitted under applicable Law without imposing any adverse cost
on Seller or Buyer, as applicable. Any such withheld amounts that are timely
withheld and deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Party to whom such amounts would have otherwise been paid.

"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) of
any payment or benefit that constitutes an "excess parachute payment" (within

Section 409A of the Code, has at all times while subject to Section 409A of

43

    

 unemployment insurance; provided that, for purposes of clarity, the portion
of this representation related to WARN Act compliance relates solely to
conduct taken by the Acquired Group Companies, Seller, or its Affiliates with
respect to Acquired Group Company Employees prior to the Closing Date that,
standing alone, would implicate or violate the WARN Act, without accounting
for or making any representation with respect to any conduct of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Group
Companies) on or following the Closing Date that might, either standing alone
or when aggregated or otherwise combined with conduct taken by the Acquired
Group Companies, Seller, or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date,
implicate the WARN Act or result in any violation of the WARN Act (whether
retroactively or otherwise). There are, and for the past three (3) years have
been, no material employment-related Legal Proceedings pending, or to the
applicable Sellers Knowledge, threatened by, against (where brought by an

any such allegations that would be material to the Acquired Group Companies,
taken as a whole.

other customarily redacted items may be redacted, provided that such redacted
information does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain
any conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing), pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, each of the parties
thereto (other than Buyer) have severally committed to lend the amounts set
forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.20_, the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated hereby and related

 (" _Sponsor_ "), including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments

Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which Sponsor has committed to
indirectly invest in Buyer the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The
Financing Commitments have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived as of the date of this Agreement, and the commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated
or otherwise modified in any respect as of the date hereof; provided that the
existence or exercise of any "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Fee Letter, as in effect on the date hereof, shall not be deemed to
constitute a modification or amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Buyer, Sponsor
(solely in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter), and, to Buyers
Knowledge, the other parties thereto, enforceable against such party in
accordance with its terms subject to the effects of applicable bankruptcy,
clarification, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, sponsorship or
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to general
principles of equity, whether considered at law or in equity. There are
no conditions precedent or contingencies (including pursuant to any " _market
flex_ " provisions) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
pursuant to the Financing Commitments, other than as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, respectively.
Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (x) the
payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Article 2_ , (y) the
repayment of all outstanding debt (and all premiums and fees payable in

Closing and (z) the payment of all other amounts to be paid by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder, and associated costs and expenses of
the transactions contemplated hereunder required to be paid by Buyer or their
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or the Financing Commitments (such
amounts, collectively, the " _Required Amounts_ "). As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which would or would reasonably be expected to constitute
a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default) on the part of
Buyer or its Affiliates under the Financing Commitments or, to Buyers
Knowledge, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, any other party to the
Financing Commitments. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained
in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, Buyer does not have
any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing required to be satisfied by it on or prior
to the Closing Date. There are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts
or arrangements (other than customary engagement letters with respect to the
offering of debt securities referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter)
related to the funding of all or any portion of the Financing necessary to
fund the Required Amounts other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and delivered to the Seller prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. The Financing Commitments and the availability of
the Financing on the Closing Date are not subject to any conditions precedent
or other conditions other than as expressly set

 forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter,
respectively. The Buyer has fully paid or caused to be paid all commitment
fees or other fees required to be paid by it on or prior to the date hereof
in connection with the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
neither the obtaining of the Financing nor the obtaining of the Alternative
Debt Financing, is a condition to the Closing.

this Agreement, Buyer shall be solvent and shall (i) be able to pay its debts
as they become due, (ii) own property that has a fair saleable value greater
than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate
of the amount of all contingent liabilities) and (iii) have adequate capital
to carry on its businesses. Buyer acknowledges that, in connection with the

may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions
of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and
subject to state securities laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer

competition laws and COVID-19 Measures) applicable to Seller or any of the

violation or waiver shall occur, including by providing redacted copies or
entering into joint defense agreements or by obtaining the consent of the
applicable third parties to permit disclosure), (3) result in the disclosure
of competitively sensitive information, or (4) in light of COVID-19,
jeopardize the health or safety of any employee of the Acquired Group
Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in such instances, and without
limitation of the proviso following the foregoing _clause (2)(y)_ , the Seller
and the Acquired Group Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(at Buyers sole cost and expense to the extent of any reasonable and
documented third-party expenses associated with such cooperation) cooperate
with Buyer to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that

62

    

 reasonably likely to result in such Partys obligations to close pursuant to
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ becoming incapable of being
satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Partys failure to give notice
of any such occurrence as required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall
not be (i) deemed to be a breach of the covenant contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, but shall (if applicable) constitute a breach of the applicable
underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or (ii) taken into
account in determining whether the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article 7_ have been satisfied. Each Party shall promptly notify the other
parties of any Legal Proceeding that shall be instituted or threatened against

amend or modify any Contract in connection with obtaining any such Consent,
(ii) pay any consideration or give anything of value to any Person for the
purpose of obtaining any such Consent, or (iii) pay any costs and expenses of
any Person resulting from the process of obtaining such Consent (other than

shall be borne exclusively by Buyer, but shall be subject to Buyers prior
written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that certain Consents and waivers with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties
to Contracts to which an Acquired Group Company is party or by which it or its
assets are otherwise bound and that such Consents and waivers may not be
obtained prior to Closing and that, unless otherwise explicitly set forth
herein, receipt of any such Consent shall in no event be a condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the other

acquisition agreements with respect to the Identified Deals until after the
Closing Date), and (v) contest, defend and appeal any threatened or pending
Legal Proceeding or preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order, in

vacated, or reversed any stay, injunction, temporary restraining order or

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

Redwood Business), (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates be required to agree to

their respective Affiliates) shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statements or disclosure with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
Party, except to the extent such disclosure is required by applicable Law or
the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the Party seeking to make such
disclosure shall promptly notify the other Party thereof and the Parties shall
use reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement

to the extent that such books, records and other information are in the
possession of Seller and its Affiliates as of the Closing) and use reasonable
best efforts to (a) give Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to its
Representatives, including employees, books and records and other information

relating to periods prior to the Closing, for any reasonable purpose,
including as may be necessary for (i) the preparation of Tax returns and
financial statements and (ii) complying with any audit request, subpoena or
other investigative demand by any Governmental Authority or for any Legal
Proceeding (including

 



66

    

 any Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Article 9_ or any vRad Retained Claim),
subject in all cases to reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon
advice of counsel in respect of applicable Laws relating to the
confidentiality of information (including any Antitrust Laws) ( _provided_
that each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to the other
Party such access and information to the maximum extent so that no such
violation or waiver shall occur), and (b) maintain all such books and records
in the same or a similar accessible format as currently existing. In the event
either Party wishes to destroy such records after such five (5) year

expense to take possession of the records. The access provided pursuant to

and effect. For a period of at least six (6) years after the Closing Date,
(A) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Group Company to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in any Acquired Group Companys

connection with acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, on or after the Closing Date

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), it being the intent of
the Parties that all such DandO Indemnified Persons shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and that no change,
modification or amendment of such documents or arrangements may be made that
will adversely affect any such DandO Indemnified Persons rights thereto
without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person and (B) Buyer

(6) years), or notice that any applicable policy has been cancelled or not so
replaced. In the event an applicable policy has been cancelled, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to provide
such information or access to Seller Parents insurer (including copies of the
applicable policy that has not been renewed) as Buyer may reasonably request.

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any

such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys fifty percent (50%)
or more of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Buyer shall ensure that proper provision is made so that such
successors, assigns or transferees shall expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or otherwise, the rights and benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under

accruals, under any Buyer Plans in which any such Continuing Employee
participates to the same extent and for the same purpose recognized by the
Acquired Group Companies under the analogous Benefit Plans or Group Benefit

the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller and its Affiliates (other than any

has any liability. As of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall
cease participation in the health and welfare benefit plans of Seller and its
Affiliates that are not sponsored or maintained by Acquired Group Companies

participation in the health and welfare plans maintained by Buyer and its
Affiliates. Seller shall be responsible for providing benefits in respect of
claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries and dependents on or prior to the Closing Date, regardless of

(y)_ , " _Recovery Costs_ "). The Parties agree that any recoveries under the
Retained Policies pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ shall inure first to
the Seller and its Affiliates to reimburse any and all Recovery Costs, without
duplication of any amounts reimbursed pursuant to _clause (y)_ above. Seller

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any " _market

written consent of Seller, permit any amendment or modification to be made
to, any replacement of all or any portion of any facilities (or commitments
thereof) described in, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Debt Commitment Letter, if such amendment, modification, replacement
or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount except by
operation of the " _market flex_ " provisions) below the Required
Amounts, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands (or
amends or modifies in any manner adverse to the interests of the Seller) any
of the conditions to the receipt of any portion of the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or (iii) would reasonably be expected to
(A) delay or prevent the Closing or (B) adversely impact the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (as defined below), including any
right to seek specific performance of the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (the amendments, modifications,
replacements or waivers described in the foregoing  _clauses (i)_ through
_(iii)_ , the " _Prohibited Financing Modifications_ "). Subject to the
limitations set out in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20(a)_,

arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not

(b) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to their respective terms (except for
amendments not prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 5.20(a)_) until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii)

 



77

    

 negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions (including any " _market flex_ "
provisions applicable thereto) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter ("
_Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ ") or on other terms not less favorable
to Buyer, in the aggregate, than the terms and conditions (including any
"market flex" provisions applicable thereto) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (provided that Prohibited Financing Modifications shall be deemed less
favorable to Buyer), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of)
all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter applicable to Buyer
that are within its control and consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter and otherwise comply in all material respects with its obligations
thereunder, (iv) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter
in a timely and diligent manner and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter in the event of a breach or other failure to fund the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing Sources, including causing
the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing, upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, on the Closing Date.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall keep
Seller informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and give the Seller prompt
written notice: ((i) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement of which they
become aware; (ii) of the receipt of any oral or written notice or other oral
or written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any
actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or
any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing
Agreement; (iii) of any dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing (other
than customary negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing);
(iv) of the occurrence of an event or development that would reasonably be
expected to adversely impact or delay the ability of Buyer to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required Amounts on
the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and
(v) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Buyer shall
promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the Seller relating
to any circumstance referred to in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_
of the immediately preceding sentence. Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing, including providing, upon request by the Seller,
copies of all documents provided to or by the lenders or otherwise related to
the Debt Financing to the Seller.

(d) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, and such
portion is reasonably required to pay the Required Amounts, Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts following the occurrence of such event to,
as promptly as practicable, arrange alternative debt financing from the same
or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the Required

 



78

    

 Amounts (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and to obtain and provide the
Seller with true, correct and complete copies of the new financing commitment
that provides for such Alternative Debt Financing (the " _Alternative_ _Debt_
_Financing Commitment Letter_ "); provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
required to obtain financing which (in the reasonable judgment of Buyer)
includes terms and conditions materially less favorable (taking into account
any "market flex" provisions), taken as a whole, to Buyer, in each case
relative to those in the Debt Financing being replaced. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Buyer be deemed or construed to require, Buyer to pay any fees
or any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex"
provisions), or agree to any "market flex" term less favorable to Buyer than
such corresponding "market flex" term contained in or contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise). As applicable, references in this
Agreement (i) to Debt Financing shall include Alternative Debt Financing, and
(ii) to any Debt Commitment Letter shall include the Alternative Debt
Financing Commitment Letter. If the Debt Commitment Letter is replaced,
amended or modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative Debt
Financing, or if Buyer substitutes other debt financing for all or any portion
of the Debt Financing in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_, Buyer
shall comply with its obligations under this Agreement, including this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.20_, with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter as so
replaced, amended or modified to the same extent that Buyer was obligated to
comply prior to the date the Debt Commitment Letter was so replaced, amended
or modified. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any Alternative Debt Financing, is not a condition to Closing.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts,
shall cause the Acquired Group Companies to use reasonable best efforts, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their personnel and
representatives, to provide, at Buyers sole cost and expense, all reasonable
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that is customary in connection
with the arrangement and implementation of the Debt Financing to be incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) prepare and provide Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as

(including its operations, financial projections and prospects) as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and customary to assist in preparation of the
Offering Documents;

(ii) assist with the preparation of Offering Documents;

(iii) have the Target Company designate members of senior management of the

financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and
customary closing certificates as may be required by the Debt Financing and
other customary documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or the Debt
Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of all conditions precedent
to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent within the control of the Seller;

 

(vii) prepare and deliver at the Closing stock certificates evidencing the
securities of each Acquired Group Company, to the extent certificated, free

Physician Practices, Health Care Laws) duly endorsed in blank or accompanied
by stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank and
otherwise in form and substance proper for transfer and reasonably acceptable
to Buyer;

 

(viii) request from the Target Companys existing lenders such customary
documents in connection with releases as requested by Buyer in connection
with the Debt Financing and collateral arrangements, including customary lien
releases and instruments of discharge;

Days prior to the Closing Date with all documentation and other information
required by Governmental Authorities with respect to the Debt Financing under
applicable " _know your customer_ " and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law on October 26, 2001) and the requirements of
31 C.F.R. § 1010.230, in each case to the extent requested in writing at least
eight Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

(x) cooperate with Buyer, and take all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Buyer to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing; and

 

(xi) use reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining third party
consents in connection with the Debt Financing;

_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or the other
operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates;

 



80

    

  _provided_ , _further_ , that none of Seller, the Acquired Group Companies
or any of their Affiliates shall be required to:

 

(A) bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, incur any
other liability or obligation, make any other payment or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing, and in the case of the
Acquired Group Companies, prior to the Closing;

 

(B) take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or
violate any Laws or result in, prior to the Closing, the contravention of, or
that would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Closing, a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract to which each
Acquired Group Company is a party and is not entered into in contemplation
hereof;

(C) (x) pass resolutions or consents (except those which are subject to
the occurrence of the Closing passed by directors or officers continuing in

or incur any liability that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would
be effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing, in each case in
connection the Debt Financing or the cooperation contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.20_;

 

(D) disclose or provide any information in connection with the Debt
Financing, the disclosure of which, in the reasonable judgment of the Seller
upon advice of outside counsel, is subject to attorney-client privilege or
could result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets or the violation of any
confidentiality obligation; provided, that, subject to not violating
attorney-client privilege, the Seller shall notify Buyer of the withholding
thereof (to the extent not prohibited thereby) and use reasonable best efforts
to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information; 

(E) take any action that would cause the Seller or Acquired Group Companies
to breach any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any condition to Closing to be not satisfied, and

 

(F) take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause any
director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Seller or the Acquired
Group Companies to incur personal liability.

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by or on
behalf of Seller, the Acquired Group Companies, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.20_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer may disclose such information to
potential Debt Financing Sources and to rating agencies during the syndication
and marketing of

 



81

    

 the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential financing sources or rating agencies. Buyer shall promptly indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives from and against, and shall promptly, upon written request by
Seller, pay and reimburse Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives for, any and all (1) costs and expenses incurred in

therewith and (2) claims asserted in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith except in the
event such claim arose out of or result from the willful misconduct or, gross
negligence of Seller, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives. The foregoing indemnification shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of
the Debt Financing nor the obtaining of any Alternative Debt Financing, is a
condition to the Closing.

 

(h) Seller hereby consents to the reasonable use by Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources of each of the Acquired Group Companies logos and of the
logos of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing.

hereby agrees (and agrees to cause each Acquired Group Company), to file any
and all consents, elections or other documents and to take any other actions
necessary or appropriate reasonably requested by Seller to allow Seller and
its Affiliates to exercise their rights and responsibilities under the prior
sentence. Buyer shall not amend or revoke any Seller Combined Returns for any

in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be required to provide any
Person with any Seller Combined Return (or amendment thereof) or copy of any

Agreement, (i) in no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be required to
provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax Return of (A) Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Group Companies) or (B) a

its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Group Companies).

(c) Unless Seller Parent and Seller jointly deliver to Buyer, no later than
forty-five (45) days prior to the deadline for making an election under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) referred to below, a
certificate to Buyer stating none of the Target Securities is a loss share as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(f)(7) and that the uniform
loss rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36 do not apply to the
purchase and sale of the Target Securities pursuant to this Agreement
(together with relevant supporting calculations and detail), Seller Parent and
Seller shall duly and timely elect under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A), and shall provide a copy thereof to Buyer, for members
of the consolidated group for United States federal income tax purposes of
which Seller Parent is the common parent corporation to reduce its stock
basis in the Target Company in

 



86

    

 connection with such purchase and sale, in whatever manner and amount is
necessary so that the attribute reduction amount (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(3)) for the Target Company is zero.

 

Section 6.2 _Apportionment_. For purposes of this Agreement, in order to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the Parties
hereto shall, to the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, treat
the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Acquired
Group Companies for all Tax purposes. For purposes of this computation, (i)
the income of each member of a U.S. federal consolidated income group which
includes both an Acquired Group Company on the one hand and Seller or any of
its Affiliates on the other hand shall be apportioned to the period up to and
including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date pursuant to
an actual closing the books of the Acquired Group Company as of the end of the
Closing Date pursuant to the principles of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76 and corresponding provisions under applicable Law _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any transactions of an Acquired Group Company occurring by or
at the direction of Buyer on the Closing Date but after the Closing other
than in the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement
shall be reported by all parties in accordance with the next day rule of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), and (ii) similar
principles shall apply to any other consolidated, combined or unitary group
which includes both an Acquired Group Company on the one hand and Seller or
any of its Affiliates on the other hand. In any case where applicable Law does
not permit the Acquired Group Companies to treat the Closing Date as the last
day of the taxable year or period, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable
to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be (x) in the case of Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis (such as
personal property taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (y) in the case of Taxes not
described in (x) (e.g., income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, gross
receipt taxes, etc.), the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or
period ended on (and included) the Closing Date based on an interim closing of
the books. For purposes of _clause (y)_ of the preceding sentence, any
exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual
basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date on a pro rata basis, determined by multiplying the
entire amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be
allocated under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall be computed by reference to
the level of such items on the Closing Date.

Section 6.3 _Reimbursement and Refunds_. Any Tax refunds (and
interest thereon) that are received by Buyer or its Affiliates (including for
these purposes the Acquired Group Companies) to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including for these purposes the Acquired Group Companies) become
entitled, that are attributable to Pre Closing Taxes. Any such refund of
Taxes or credits against Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Tax Periods in
accordance with the principles of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

 



87

    

 For the avoidance of doubt, if, in lieu of receiving any refund described in
the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, Buyer or its Affiliates
(including for these purposes any Acquired Group Company) uses any amount
credited against Tax to reduce or offset a Tax liability (including estimated
Tax payments) with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly
pay or cause to be paid to the Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax
liability. Buyer shall pay over to the Seller any cash refund described in the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (net of any costs or expenses
(including Taxes, but excluding the costs incurred to prepare any Tax Return
of Buyer or its Affiliates, including any Acquired Group Company, for any
Post-Closing Tax Period) incurred by Buyer to obtain or in receiving such
refund) within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. This paragraph shall not
be construed to require Seller or Buyer to make available any Tax Returns (or
any other information relating to Taxes) to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, or
to file any amended Tax Return or other claim for a refund of Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

Section 6.4 _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties and their Affiliates agree to
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records)
and assistance relating to the Acquired Group Companies, as is reasonably
requested for the filing of any Tax Returns, and for the preparation of, and
for the prosecution or defense of any Tax audit or Third-Party Claim (other
than any Third-Party Claim between Buyer and its Affiliate on the one hand
and Seller and its Affiliate on the other hand) related to Taxes, including
executing and delivering such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_; provided
that the Seller shall not be required under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ or any
other provision in this Agreement to provide to Buyer (x) any Tax Return of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Group Companies)
or any Tax Return of a consolidated, unitary or combined group of which the
Seller or such Affiliates are part or (y) any information that is privileged
if the disclosure of such information is reasonably expected to result in the
loss of such privilege. Without limiting any other requirements under this
Agreement, Buyer shall cause each relevant Acquired Group Company to timely
provide to Seller all information reasonably requested by Seller to prepare
the combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Returns to be filed by Seller or any
of its Affiliates (the " _Tax Package_ "). To the extent reasonably necessary
to facilitate Sellers use of the Tax Package, Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to prepare the Tax Package in a manner materially consistent with the
direction provided by Seller for preparation of such Tax Package and shall
provide Seller, upon prior written notice, with reasonable access to
the relevant Acquired Group Company Employees. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall deliver (or cause an Acquired Group Company to deliver)
to Seller the Tax Package for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date no
later than the earlier of (x) forty-five (45) days before the date a
combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return will be filed by Seller or its
Affiliates reflecting the information contained in such Tax Package and (y)
the six month anniversary of the Closing Date. Any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Group Companies) in preparing the Tax Package shall be promptly reimbursed by
Seller upon written notice detailing the amount and nature of such costs and
expenses. Buyer shall also reasonably cooperate with Seller to provide to
Seller such information (or estimates in lieu of information not reasonably
available) as may be required to determine estimated Tax payments, current
and deferred Tax liabilities, Tax reserve items, and any additional current or
prior information required by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Any information
obtained under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall be kept confidential, except
(i) as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of

 



88

    

 Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding or defending any Tax claim, or (ii) with the consent of the
Parties, as the case may be. The Parties agree to (a) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Acquired Group
Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified
by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax
Authority and (b) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests, shall allow the requesting party to take
possession of such books and records (other than any information that Seller
and Buyer, as applicable, reasonably believe to be privileged).

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, value-
added, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation, registration and other similar taxes,
together with any interest or penalties thereon, resulting directly from or
imposed in connection with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated
hereby (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand. The Party primarily or customarily
responsible under the applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns (or causing
such Tax Returns to be filed) will file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges, and the other Party and its Affiliates will (x) reasonably cooperate
in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns and other documentation
(including, if required by applicable Law, joining in (or causing its
Affiliates to join in) in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation) and (y) promptly pay to the filing Party an amount equal
to its share of any Transfer Taxes (determined as described above). Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with each other in order to minimize applicable
Transfer Taxes in a manner that is mutually agreeable and in compliance with
applicable Law.

Section 6.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause all Tax sharing
agreements, arrangements, policies and guidelines, formal or informal, express
or implied, that may exist between (x) the Acquired Group Companies, on the
one hand, and (y) Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, and all rights
and obligations thereunder, to terminate as of the Closing Date, so that the
Acquired Group Companies shall have no rights or liabilities thereunder.

TERMINATION 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Closing, this
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned as follows (and the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_)
shall give written notice of such termination to the other Parties setting
forth the basis on which it is terminating this Agreement):

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer or by the Seller, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2021 (as may be extended
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_, the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that if on the then-applicable Termination Date (i) the conditions
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in _Section_ __
_ 7.1(a)_ or, to the extent such Law or Order arises under the Antitrust
Laws,  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, shall not have been satisfied and (ii) each

91

    

 Termination Date shall automatically be extended up to two (2) times for a
period of three (3) months each, first to June 8, 2021 and then to September
8, 2021;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any such
Party if such Partys (or in the case of Seller, any Affiliates) willful and
intentional breach of any of its material obligations under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur before the
Termination Date (it being understood that Buyers failure to close solely as
a result of the unavailability of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt
Financing to be funded at the Closing shall not limit Buyers termination
right pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ so long as Buyer is
not otherwise in breach of this Agreement);

(c) by Buyer or Seller, if (i) there shall be any Law enacted, promulgated
or issued by any Governmental Authority that makes consummation of the Closing
illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Order permanently enjoining the transactions contemplated by

_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

causes such Order;

 

(d) by Buyer, if (i) there shall have been a material breach by Seller (or
any Acquired Group Company) of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein that would result in the failure of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ to be
satisfied, (ii) Buyer is not then in breach of any material provision of this
Agreement, which breach causes or would reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ not
to be satisfied, and (iii) such breach by Seller cannot be cured, or, if able
to be cured, (A) shall not have been cured on or prior to the earlier of (1)
the Termination Date and (2) forty-five (45) Business Days after receipt
by Seller of written notice of such breach from Buyer, and (B) in the case of
the foregoing _clause_ _(2)_ , cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date;

 

(e) by Seller, if (i) there shall have been a material breach by Buyer of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that
would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ to be satisfied, (ii) Seller (or any
Acquired Group Company) is not then in breach of any material provision of
this Agreement, which breach causes or would reasonably be expected to cause
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and (iii) such breach by Buyer cannot be cured,
or, if able to be cured, (A) shall not have been cured on or prior to the
earlier of (1) the Termination Date and (2) forty-five (45) Business Days
after receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach from Seller, and (B)
in the case of the foregoing _clause_ _(2)_ , cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date; or

 

(f) by Seller, if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but which would be satisfied if the Closing Date
were the date of such termination) and continued to be satisfied during the
three (3) Business Day period described below, (ii) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed to Buyer in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing and all of the conditions to the Sellers obligations to
consummate the Closing have been satisfied or irrevocably waived and

 



92

    

 (iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing by the later of the third
Business Day following (A) the date of the notice described in _clause (ii)_
and (B) the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and the Seller stood ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing throughout such period.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with this _Article 8_ :

(a) this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (except for this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, the Confidentiality Agreement, the final sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.20(f)_ and _Article 10_ (other
than  _Section_ __ _ 10.11_) each of which shall survive such termination
and remain valid and binding obligations of the Parties in accordance with
their terms); and

 

(b) there shall be no liability of any kind on the part of Buyer or Seller
or any of Buyers or Sellers former, current or future Affiliates,
Representatives, officers, directors, direct or indirect general or limited
partners, equityholders, stockholders, controlling persons, managers or
members; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_,
termination pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall not relieve either Party from
such liability (i) pursuant to the sections specified in _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)_ that survive termination or (ii) for any Willful Breach of this
Agreement arising prior to such termination or for Fraud; _provided_ ,
however, that except in the case of a Willful Breach or Fraud by Buyer
(subject to the last two sentences of  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_), in no event
will Buyer or Buyers former, current or future Affiliates, Representatives,
officers, directors, direct or indirect general or limited partners,
equityholders, stockholders, controlling persons, managers or members have
any liability for monetary damages if and to the extent Buyer makes payment to
Seller of an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Reverse Termination Fee, if
any, due and owing to Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, (y) the
Enforcement Costs, if any, due and owing to the Seller pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, plus (z) the indemnification or reimbursement obligations
specifically set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.20(f)_.

Section 8.3 _Reverse Termination Fee_. In the event that this Agreement
is validly terminated by (A) Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, (B) Buyer or Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_, or (C) Buyer or Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ (to the
extent such Law or Order arises under the Antitrust Laws) and, in the case of
_clauses (B)_ or _(C)_ , on the date of such termination all of the
conditions to closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived, other than (1) in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, to the extent such Law or Order arises under the
Antitrust Laws and (2) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing (which in the case of _clause_ _(2)_ would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination) (each of
the foregoing a " _Reverse Termination Fee Trigger_ "), then Buyer shall
promptly pay or cause to be paid (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the date of such termination) an aggregate cash amount
equal to $40,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars; provided that Seller
shall not be entitled to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to the
foregoing  _clauses (B)_ or _(C)_ in the event Seller at the time of such
termination has not complied with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.6_
in all material respects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that this Agreement is validly terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(f)_ due to Buyers failure to consummate the Closing and the failure of
the Sponsor to the fund the Equity Financing was the proximate cause
of Buyers failure to consummate the

 



93

    

 Closing, the Reverse Termination Fee shall be an aggregate cash amount equal
to $45,000,000. Each of Buyer acknowledges that the agreement to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, as and when payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such
amount in the circumstances in which such amount is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Buyer shall also pay any documented out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by any Seller and its Affiliates
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) up to an amount equal to
$1,500,000 (the " _Enforcement Costs_ ") in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against
Buyer. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_
shall accrue interest at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in The Wall Street Journal and shall be calculated on a daily
basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but
excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a 360-day year.
The Parties agree and understand that in no event shall Buyer be required to
pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion and under no
circumstances shall the Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and any portion of the
Reverse Termination Fee or other monetary damages. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of a Willful Breach
or Fraud by Buyer (subject to the last two sentences of this _Section_ __ _
8.3_), if Seller receives the Reverse Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, such payment, together with any interest, costs,
fees or expenses due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and any amounts
payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.20(f)_, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer and its Affiliates or any Debt
Financing Source and none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Debt
Financing Source shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to a Reverse Termination Fee
Trigger except in the case of a Willful Breach or Fraud by Buyer (subject to
the last two sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_), Sellers right to
receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (and any Enforcement Costs, if
applicable) in the circumstances in which it is payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, in any case, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any and all losses suffered or incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement (and the actual or purported termination
hereof) and the Ancillary Agreements, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing, the failure of the Closing to occur or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment thereof), or any matter
forming the basis for such termination. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to a Reverse Termination Fee Trigger, except in
the case of a Willful Breach or Fraud by Buyer (subject to the last two
sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_), neither Buyer nor any its Affiliates
shall have any liability to Seller or its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Group Companies), and Seller and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Group
Companies) shall not have (and hereby agree not to initiate, pursue, or
otherwise participate in (whether directly or indirectly)) any rights or
actions (whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)) against
Buyer or its Affiliates, in each case, with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the
failure of the Closing to occur or any other transactions contemplated
hereunder or thereunder (or the abandonment thereof) or any matter

 



94

    

 forming the basis for such termination, other than (i) the obligation of
Buyer to pay, or cause to be paid, the Reverse Termination Fee (and any
Enforcement Costs, if applicable) in the event that the Reverse Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and (ii) any amounts
payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.20(f)_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Seller be
entitled to receive both the Reverse Termination Fee and any Enforcement
Costs, on the one hand, and an award of monetary damages, on the other hand,
and prior to commencing any Legal Proceeding to enforce its rights under this
Agreement in connection with a termination pursuant to a Reverse Termination
Fee Trigger, Seller shall be required to elect, and thereafter shall have its
recovery limited for all purposes hereunder, to seek either the
Reverse Termination Fee and any Enforcement Costs, on the one hand, or an
award of monetary damages, on the other hand (and never either or both).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Buyer be deemed to be in Willful Breach to the extent the unavailability of
the Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing to be funded at the
Closing shall have resulted in Buyers breach of this Agreement so long as
Buyer is not otherwise in breach of this Agreement.

prior to the Indemnification Expiration Date shall not thereafter be barred by
the occurrence of the Indemnification Expiration Date, and such claims shall
survive until finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representations and warranties of
Buyer set forth in _Article 4_ or in any Ancillary Agreement;

(b) any Buyer Indemnified Taxes; or

 

(c) any Pre-Closing Onsite Med Mal Claims.

 

Section 9.4 _Limitations and Other Matters Relating to_ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 9_ , except
in the case of Seller or its Affiliates Fraud, (i) Seller shall not have any
liability to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ for Losses
unless and until such Losses borne by the Buyer Indemnitees exceed $3,225,000,
in which case Seller shall be responsible for all such additional Losses up
to a cap of $3,225,000 (i.e., Seller shall be responsible for all such Losses
from $3,225,000 up to $6,450,000 of such total Losses) and (ii) Seller shall
not have any liability to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2(g)_ (other than in respect of item 1 on _Exhibit E_ ) for Losses unless
and until such Losses borne by the Buyer Indemnitees exceed, in the case of
each of items 2, 3 and 4 on  _Exhibit E_ , $1,000,000 per such item and in
the case of items 2, 3 and 4 in the aggregate, in no event shall Seller be
responsible for such Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(g)_ in an amount
in excess of $5,000,000.

 



96

    

(b) The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this _Article 9_ shall
be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds (including the RandW
Insurance Policy proceeds) and any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment (including net cash Tax benefits), actually received by the
Indemnified Party following such Indemnified Partys commercially reasonable
efforts to recover, in respect of such Losses or any of the events,
conditions, facts or circumstances resulting in or relating to such Losses ("
_Third-Party Payments_ "), net of the out-of-pocket cost or expense (including
Taxes) to recover or as a result of the receipt of such payment and to the
extent exceeding any deductible, de minimis or other amount not recoverable
from the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If an Indemnified Party receives any
Third-Party Payment with respect to any Losses for which it has
previously been indemnified (directly or indirectly) by an Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days after receiving such Payment) pay to the Indemnifying Party the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount the Indemnified Party actually received
from the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses over (ii) the amount the
Indemnified Party would have received from the Indemnifying Party in respect
of such Losses pursuant to this Agreement had such Third-Party Payment been
received prior to the Indemnified Party being indemnified hereunder.

(c) For the purposes of the prior paragraph, an Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to have "actually realized" a Tax benefit in respect of a Loss to the
extent that, and at such time as, either (i) the amount of Taxes (other than
estimated Taxes) paid by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
(including, in the case of Buyer, the Acquired Group Companies) during the
taxable year the Loss is realized and the following taxable year is reduced
below the amount of Taxes that such Persons would have been required to pay
but for the Loss, or (ii) the Loss is carried back to a prior Tax period and
results in receipt of a cash Tax refund that would otherwise be for the
benefit of Buyer (taking into account the provision of this Agreement).

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and minimize
any Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ and
promptly upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to constitute or give rise to such Losses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether any representation or warranty has been
breached and the amount of Losses arising therefrom, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement and the schedules and exhibits hereto shall be read
without regard and without giving effect to the terms "material," "in all
material respects," "Material Adverse Effect," "except where the failure to so
comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect" or
similar words or phrases contained in such representation or warranty (as if
such words or phrases were deleted from such representation and warranty),
except as they are used in _Section_ __ _ 3.7(b)_ and the definition of "
_Material Contract_ ".

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall
Buyer or Seller be required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or
reimburse any Indemnified Party for Losses under this _Article 9_ to the
extent such Losses were taken into account in the determination of the Final
Adjustment Report pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 



97

    

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to reimbursement or other recover under this
_Article 9_ for any amount to the extent any Buyer Indemnitee has already been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

(a) All claims for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall be
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.5_. A Person entitled to indemnification (a " _Claim_ ") pursuant to this
_Article 9_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give the Indemnifying Party
written notice of any such Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which notice shall
include a description in reasonable detail of (i) the basis for, and nature
of, such Claim, including the facts constituting the basis for such Claim,
and (ii) the estimated amount of the Losses that have been or may be sustained
by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Claim. Any Claim Notice shall
be given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party, (A) in the case
of a Claim in connection with any Legal Proceeding made or brought by any
Person (other than Buyer or Seller (or their respective Affiliates) in
connection with this Agreement) against such Indemnified Party relating to
the Acquired Group Companies, their assets or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), promptly, but in any event not
later than fifteen (15) Business Days, following receipt of notice of the
assertion or commencement of such Legal Proceeding, and (B) in the case of a
Claim other than a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), promptly, but in
any event not later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware of the facts constituting the basis for __ such Direct Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure to give such prompt written notice
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will
cooperate in good faith to resolve any Direct Claim for a period of twenty
(20) Business Days before commencing any Legal Proceeding in connection with
such Claim. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Indemnifying Party_ " means
Buyer (in the case of a claim for indemnification by any Seller Indemnitee) or
the Seller (in the case of a claim for indemnification by any Buyer
Indemnitee).

(b) With respect to any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim at
the Indemnifying Partys expense with counsel of its choosing, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense (provided
however that Buyer shall have no right to assume control of a Third-Party
Claim that involves a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return which
includes Seller or any of its Affiliates). The Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is not controlling such defense
shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it. To the extent
reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
consult with the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume in writing

 



98

    

 control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim (or if such Third-Party
Claim involves a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return which includes
Seller or any of its Affiliates, and the Indemnifying Party is Buyer) or if
the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume control of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may control the defense of such
Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choosing (subject however to the
requirement that the Indemnified Party must utilize commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue and preserve available insurance coverage), and the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the __ reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of such defense to the Indemnified Party. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including by retaining and providing to
the Party controlling such defense records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim and making available employees on a
mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is controlling such defense shall
keep the other Party reasonably advised of the status of such Legal
Proceeding and the defense thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except as
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_), (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not
agree to any settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delated), unless such settlement would (A) include a
complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities or obligations with respect thereto, (B) only call for a
cash payment to the Indemnified Party, the full amount of which is
indemnified hereunder or by insurance and does not impose any liability or
obligation (including any equitable remedies) on the Indemnified Party and (C)
not involve a finding or admission of any wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party, and (ii) an Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing (but
subject to _Article 6_ ), if (i) defendants in any action include any
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by its counsel that there may be legal defenses available to
such Indemnified Party inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such action or the defense thereof,
(iii) the third party seeks an injunction or any equitable remedy that would
be binding upon the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) the
Third-Party Claim seeks to impose criminal liability on the Indemnified Party,
or (v) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to diligently prosecute or
defend such Third-Party Claim (provided that the Indemnified Party notifies
the Indemnifying Party of such failure, and the Indemnifying Party fails to
cure such failure within fifteen (15) Business Days); then, in each such case,
if the Indemnified Party, in its sole discretion so elects, it shall be
entitled to employ separate counsel and to control the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party related to the
defense of such Third-Party Claim shall be indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, _Sections_
_9.5(b)_ and _9.5(c)_ shall not apply to vRad Retained Claims.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Closing, Seller shall have the sole power to direct and control each of the
vRad Retained Claims and any matter that involves a claim by any Person,

 



99

    

 known or unknown, involving a vRad Retained Claim. With respect to any Claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, Seller shall, without
the requirement to provide notice (written or otherwise) to Buyer
Indemnitees, assume control of the defense of such vRad Retained Claim at
Sellers expense with counsel of its choosing; provided, that Seller shall
provide notice and keep the Buyer Indemnitees reasonably informed in respect
of any vRad Retained Claim that is reasonably expected to involve over
$1,000,000 in Losses. The Buyer Indemnitees shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller, at Sellers sole cost and expense, in connection with the defense of
any vRad Retained Claim, including by retaining, and providing to Seller and
its Representatives access to, such available defense records and information
that are relevant to such vRad Retained Claim and making available to Seller
and its Representatives employees, contractors, Affiliates, books and records
and other properties of the Buyer Indemnitees, in each case in such a manner
so as (i) not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of
Buyer, its Subsidiaries and the Acquired Group Companies, (ii) violate or
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, privilege or
other immunity or protection, (iii) violate (x) any Law or Order or (y)
Contract or obligations of confidentiality. The Buyer Indemnitees and the
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with any vRad Retained
Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney client or work
product privileges. Seller shall also provide the Buyer Indemnitees with
quarterly loss run reports in respect of any vRad Retained Claims, subject to
the foregoing limitations on the production of privileged and confidential
material.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, _Sections
9.5(b)_ and _9.5(c)_ shall not apply to any Pre-Closing Onsite Med Mal
Claims, and Buyer shall have the sole power to direct and control each of the
Pre-Closing Onsite Med Mal Claims.

 

Section 9.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this  _Article 9_ or _Article 6_ shall be
deemed adjustments to the purchase price for the Target Securities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_ _; No Duplication; No Set-off_. 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
(other than claims arising from Fraud) (i) this _Article 9_ and _Article 6_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) neither Buyer
nor Seller shall be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) to any Indemnified Party for a breach of
this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the purchase of the Target Securities pursuant
hereto, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article 9_ and _Article 6_ , __ and (iii) each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims,
causes of action, suits, demands and Legal Proceedings (A) for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or (B) otherwise relating to or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, that it may have against
the other Party and any of such Partys Affiliates or Representatives arising
under or

 



100

    

 based upon any applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 9_ and _Article 6_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7(a)_ shall limit the
rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies by,
any Party pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate to interfere with the
operation of)  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.11_.

(b) Any Losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such Losses. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except
as may be expressly set forth herein or therein, it shall have no right under
this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to become due and owing) to the
other Party, whether under this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, or
otherwise, against any other amount owed (or to become due and owing) to it
by the other Party.

Section 10.4 _Amendment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by
an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto and
executed by each of the Seller and Buyer.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_, _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, _Section_ __ _
10.7_, _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ and  _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ (or any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent that an amendment of such provision

in a manner that is adverse in any respect to a Debt Financing Source without
the prior written consent of the Commitment Parties (as defined in the Debt

Section 10.5 _Waivers_. Buyer or Seller may, at any time, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other

any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. No waiver by any

 



102

    

 Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly

waiving. No waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement shall operate
or be construed as a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach, whether of
a similar or different character, unless expressly set forth in such written
waiver. No waivers to the provisions of which the Debt Financing Sources are
expressly made third party beneficiaries pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.7_
shall be permitted in a manner that is adverse to any such Debt Financing
Source without the prior written consent of the Commitment Parties (as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter). Neither any course of conduct or
failure or delay of any Party in exercising or enforcing any right, remedy or
power hereunder shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, remedy or
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power.

Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any situation or in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision hereof
or the offending term or provision in any other situation or any other
jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either
Party; _provided_ , that the Parties intend that the remedies and limitations
thereon contained in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ be construed as an integral
provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not
be severable in any manner that increases Buyers liability or obligations
hereunder. Upon any determination pursuant to the foregoing sentence that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible, in a
mutually acceptable manner, in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except to the extent provided
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, _Article 9_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ (the
provisions of which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons referenced
therein as third-party beneficiaries of such provisions), this Agreement

respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.4_,  _Section_ __ _
10.5_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ and _Section_ __ _
10.16_ (and the definitions related thereto) shall be enforceable by each
Debt Financing Source (and each is an intended third party beneficiary
thereof).

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties
and any purported assignment or delegation in contravention of this _Section_
__ _ 10.8_ shall be null and void and of no force and effect; provided that
Buyer may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations pursuant to
this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt

 



103

    

 Financing. Subject to the preceding sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 10.8_,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall
be enforceable by the Parties and its respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all matters, claims,
controversies, disputes, suits, actions or proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including all
rights of the Parties (whether sounding in contract, tort, common or statutory
law, equity or otherwise) in connection therewith, shall be interpreted,
construed and governed by and in accordance with, and enforced pursuant to,
the internal Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties hereby (i) agrees and irrevocably consents to
submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware, and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of

Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether in contract, tort, common
or statutory law, equity or otherwise) anywhere other than the Chosen Courts
and (v) agrees that a final and non-appealable judgment in any such Legal
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence (A) shall not limit the
jurisdiction of the Accounting Firm as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
and (B) shall include any Legal Proceeding brought for the purpose of
enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of the Accounting Firm. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Legal Proceeding brought in any Chosen Court in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 10.10(a)_. Each of the Parties agrees that the service of any
process, summons, notice or document in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding in the manner provided in  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, will be valid and sufficient
service thereof. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it will not bring
or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third party claim
or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in Contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America, in each case, sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, and any appellate court from
any thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY (I) ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT
MAY ARISE UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND
(II) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATING OR
INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT
FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING). EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (B) CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, (C) UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND (D) MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY.

Section 10.11 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including _Section_ __
_ 10.11(d)_ below), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
Party will be deemed cumulative and will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy provided by Law or in equity.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage and harm would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its terms and that, although monetary damages may be available for such a
breach, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly,
each of the Parties agrees that Buyer or the Seller shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches of any provision of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. A Party seeking
an order or injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof shall not be required to provide,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any such order or injunction, and each Party hereby
waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or other security. In the event that any Legal Proceeding
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, each
Party agrees that it shall not allege, and each Party hereby waives the
defense, that there is an adequate remedy available at law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that Seller shall be
entitled to seek and obtain specific performance of Buyers obligation to
consummate the Closing if, but only if and for so long as, (i) the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied assuming a
Closing would occur at such

 



105

    

 time) or have been waived by Buyer, (ii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed to
Buyer in writing that, all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ have been satisfied and if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing is funded, Seller is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded
in accordance with its terms and conditions at the Closing or will be funded
at the Closing if Buyer funds the remaining portion of the Closing Payment at
the Closing ( _provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to consummate the
Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact funded at the Closing) and (iv)
Buyer fails to consummate the Closing by the later of (A) two (2) Business
Days following the date of the notice described in _clause (ii)_ and (B) the
date the Closing is required to have occurred in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.3_.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of Sellers
right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit Sellers right
to terminate this Agreement and be paid the Reverse Termination Fee as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_; provided, that in no event shall Buyer be
obligated to both (x) specifically perform the consummation of the Closing
and (y) pay (A) the Reverse Termination Fee and any Enforcement Costs or (B)
any amount of monetary damages.

(c) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in the Seller Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure Schedules is intended
to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure
Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items
or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or
matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement with the benefit of competent legal representation, and the
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties to express their mutual intent. In the event that an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions hereof.

 

(e) References to any document or information having been "delivered" or
"made available" by Seller to Buyer shall include Seller or its
Representatives having posted any such document or information to the Data
Room or otherwise having delivered a copy of such document or information to
Buyer (electronically or otherwise) prior to 5:00 p.m. ET on September 9,
2020 (subject to any redactions of information contained therein or
restrictions on access to particularly competitively sensitive information as
reasonably deemed necessary or appropriate by Seller).

 

(f) The Seller Disclosure Schedules and Buyer Disclosure Schedules shall be
arranged in sections that correspond to the Sections of this Agreement to
which such sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Buyer Disclosure
Schedules, as applicable, relate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the disclosure
of any information in any section of such schedules shall also constitute
disclosure for purposes of all other Sections of this Agreement with respect
to which such disclosure, as it relates to such other Section of this
Agreement, is applicable or reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure (without need to examine any underlying document).

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_ _and Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement
and any Ancillary Agreements may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement or document. A
signed copy of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements transmitted by
facsimile, email or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to
have the same legal effect as delivery of an original executed copy of this
Agreement for all purposes.

Section 10.14 _Releases_.

 

(a) As of the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, as of
immediately following the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) (each, a "
_Releasing Buyer Person_ "), hereby releases and forever discharges Seller and
each of its respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, former, current or
future direct or indirect stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons
in each case, solely in their capacities as a direct or indirect equityholder
of the Acquired Companies (each, a " _Released Seller Person_ ") from all
debts, demands, causes of action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any
and all claims, defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities
whatsoever, of every name and nature, both at law and in equity, known or
unknown, accrued or unaccrued, that have been or could have been asserted
against any Released Seller Person, that any Releasing Buyer Person has or
ever had, that arises out of or in any way relates to events, circumstances or
actions occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in
respect of matters relating to their direct or indirect equity ownership of
the Acquired Group Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that this _Section_ __ _ 10.14(a)_ does not apply to
and shall not constitute a release of any rights or obligations to the extent
arising under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or claims of
Fraud.

 

(b) As of the Closing, the Seller, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries
(excluding, as of immediately following the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
(each, a _Releasing Seller Person_ ") hereby releases and forever discharges
Buyer, the Acquired Group Companies and each of their respective Affiliates,
successors, assigns, former, current or future direct or indirect
stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, portfolio companies,
members, general or limited partners or other Representatives in each case,
solely in their capacities as such (each, a " _Released Buyer Person_ ") from
all debts, demands, causes of action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any
and all claims, defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities
whatsoever, of every name and nature, both at law and in equity, known or
unknown, accrued or unaccrued, that have been or could have been asserted
against any Released Buyer Person, that Seller has or ever had, that arises
out of or in any way relates to events, circumstances or actions occurring,
existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of matters
relating to the Acquired Group Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section_ __ _ 10.14(b)_ does not
apply to and shall not constitute a release of any rights or obligations to
the extent arising under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or
claims of Fraud.

 

Section 10.15 _Provision Regarding Legal Representation_. Recognizing that
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP (" _Cleary Gottlieb_ ") and DLA Piper
LLP (US) (" _DLA Piper_ " and together with Cleary Gottlieb, " _Seller_ __ _s
Counsel_ ") has acted as legal counsel to Seller Parent, Seller, the Acquired
Companies and their Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Sellers Counsel
intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and its respective Affiliates (which
will no longer include the Acquired Group Companies) after the Closing, Buyer
hereby waives (on its own behalf) and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group

 



108

    

 Companies) to waive, any conflicts arising under such representation that
may prevent Sellers Counsel from representing Seller or any of its respective
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer and
the Acquired Companies or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, the Acquired Group
Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Sellers
Counsel, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Acquired Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Acquired Group Companies shall not have access to any such communications or
to the files of Sellers Counsel relating to such engagement from and after
the Closing, and no actions taken by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to retain, remove or otherwise protect such communications
will be deemed a breach or violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) Seller and its
respective Affiliates (and not the Acquired Group Companies) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement in
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no Acquired Group Company shall be a holder thereof,
(b) to the extent that files of Sellers Counsel in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its respective
Affiliates (and not the Acquired Group Companies) shall hold such property
rights and (c) Sellers Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the
Acquired Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Sellers Counsel and the Acquired Group Companies or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ waives or transfers any
attorney-client privilege to the extent relating to Sellers Counsel
representation of the Acquired Group Companies with respect to any of their
on-going or routine matters relating to their operations, business, assets or
liabilities (other than in preparation for or otherwise related to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and such
attorney-client and other privileges shall continue to be the privilege of the
Acquired Group Companies. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute
arises between Buyer or any Acquired Group Companies or an Affiliate, on the
one hand, and a third party other than a Party to this Agreement, on the other
hand, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by
Cleary Gottlieb and DLA Piper to such third party and in any such dispute,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the applicable Acquired Company.

 

Section 10.16 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources_. No Debt Financing
Source shall have any liability or obligation to Seller and its Affiliates
and any of the Sellers or any of such Affiliates respective current, former
or future officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or partners with respect to
this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in
Contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other
theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
to: (A) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an 

 



109

    

 inducement to, this Agreement), (C) any breach or violation of this
Agreement and (D) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder to be
consummated, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged by Seller that no
personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any Debt Financing Source, as such, arising under,
out of, in connection with or related to the items in the immediately
preceding _clauses (A)_ through _(D)_. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section_ __ _ 10.16_ does not limit or affect any rights or remedies that
Buyer may have against the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter.
