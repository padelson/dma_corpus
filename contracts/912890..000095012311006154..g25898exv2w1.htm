legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or formed and has all requisite corporate or other power,
as the case may be, and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it make such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,

stockholder of Purchaser), and no other corporate action on the part of Parent and Purchaser is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this
Agreement and the consummation by them of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed

Company and its Subsidiaries who continues as an employee of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a &#147;<U>Continuing Employee</U>&#148;),
for a period extending until the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employee&#146;s
employment with such entities or the last day of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
(the &#147;<U>Benefits Continuation Period</U>&#148;) (i)&nbsp;a base wage or salary at a rate not less than the
rate of such base wage or salary in effect at the Effective Time and (ii)&nbsp;401(k) benefits,
severance benefit eligibility, medical benefits and other welfare benefit plans, programs and

provided under the Company Plans as in effect at the Effective Time; (B)&nbsp;are substantially
comparable to those provided to management employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries; or (C)
constitute any combination of the foregoing. With respect to each Continuing Employee whose annual
bonus for the fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 2011 has been accrued and unpaid prior to the Effective
Time and who is eligible to receive an annual bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Company Plan, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to such Continuing
Employee such bonus in such amount as approved by the Company and which bonus shall be payable in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such Company Plan and shall be paid at such time as is
consistent with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries and without duplication of
awards otherwise paid including pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;5.1(a)(v)</U>. The provisions of this
<U>Section&nbsp;5.13</U> shall not be construed or interpreted to restrict in any way the Surviving
Corporation&#146;s or Parent&#146;s ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan (including to
change the entities who administer such Company Plans, or the manner in which such Company Plans
are administered) to the extent not inconsistent with such foregoing restrictions or any other plan
made available to the Continuing Employees or to terminate any person&#146;s employment at any time or
for any reason.

and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or
successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is eligible to participate in immediately following the Effective Time to the
extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Company Plan in which such
employee participated, (ii)&nbsp;provide each such employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the
analogous Company Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements and (iii)&nbsp;to the extent

(but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit, retiree welfare or any other plan) to the

Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective

amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under the Paid-Time Off Program, set forth
on <U>Section&nbsp;5.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule</U>, as of the Effective Time; provided,
