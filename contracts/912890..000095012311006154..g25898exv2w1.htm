 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 27, 2011 (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among Verizon Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Verizon Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and Terremark Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Section 8.11_. 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company have unanimously determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders; 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company have unanimously, and the Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously by those directors present and voting, approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, Purchaser shall commence a tender offer to purchase all of the shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") for $19.00 per Share (such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such cash tender offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS, Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain Shares as provided in _Section 2.7_ ) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ "); and 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into this Agreement, that certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Supporting Stockholders_ ") enter into Tender and Support Agreements, each dated as of the date hereof (the " _Support Agreements_ "), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among other things, each Supporting Stockholder has agreed to (i) tender all Shares it beneficially owns in the Offer, (ii) vote to adopt this Agreement and (iii) take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in the Support Agreements. 

       ##### 

  

     

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Offer_  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Unless this Agreement shall have previously been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_, and provided that the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section 1.2_, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but no earlier than the tenth (10th) Business Day and no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the initial public announcement of the execution of this Agreement (which initial public announcement shall occur no later than the first (1st) Business Day following execution and delivery of this Agreement). 

   

 (b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent and Purchaser) of the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the Company that (i) decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amends, modifies or waives the Minimum Condition, (vi) modifies or amends any of the Offer Conditions in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or (vii) except as provided in _Section 1.1(c)_, extends the Initial Offer Expiration Date. 

   

 (c) _Expiration and Extensions of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ that, if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition is not then satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law, waived, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for consecutive periods of at least five (5) Business Days but no more than ten (10) Business Days, each as determined 

      ##### 

  

    

by Parent, or for such longer period(s) as Parent and the Company may
otherwise agree, up until the Walk-Away Date to permit such Offer
Condition(s) to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if all of the
Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition and those Offer
Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the
Offer have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law, waived, Purchaser shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to terminate the Offer ten (10) days after the date on which all
of the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition and those Offer
Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the
Offer have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law, waived (but not earlier than ninety (90) days after the
date hereof). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing contained in this _Section
1.1(c)_, Purchaser shall be required to extend the Offer on one or more
occasions for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or of Nasdaq applicable to the Offer; _provided_
, _however_ , that such extension shall be subject to the right to terminate
the Offer in accordance with _Section 1.1(f)_ , and the parties respective
rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , and nothing
contained herein shall require Purchaser to extend the period during which
the Offer remains open to any date after the Walk-Away Date. The "Initial
Offer Expiration Date" as it may be extended is referred to as the "
_Expiration Date._ " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 1.1(c)_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section
7.1_ , then Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day after such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. 

   

 (d) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If, as of the Offer Closing, all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Laws, waived by Purchaser) but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken together with Shares, if any, then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, constitutes less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding, without the consent of the Company, Purchaser shall have the right to provide for a " _subsequent offering period_ " (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act). 

   

 (e) _Payment_. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or permitted waiver of all the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Expiration Date and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-10 and Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. On or prior to the date that Purchaser becomes obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. The payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to and 

      ##### 

  

    

subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Offer Closing_ ". 

   

 (f) _Continuing Pursuit of the Merger_. If at any then-scheduled Expiration Date occurring after the later of April 4, 2011 and the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law, waived (other than Offer Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Expiration Date), then Purchaser may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith shall pursue the Merger as contemplated in _Section 5.4_ (it being understood that the provisions of this _Section 1.1(f)_ shall not limit the rights of Parent and Purchaser under _Section 1.1(c)_ to terminate the Offer without pursuing the Merger). 

   

 (g) _Termination of the Offer_. The termination of the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_ or _Section 1.1(f)_ is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination_ ". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 1.1_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, then Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day after such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof in accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable Law.

Board of Directors. 

   

 (b) _Independent Directors_. Following the Offer Closing, without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, at all times prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall be composed of not less than three (3) Independent Directors each of whom shall be a Qualified Person, and (i) if the number of Independent Directors shall ever be fewer than three (3) for any reason (or if immediately following Offer Closing there are not at least three (3) then-existing directors of the Company who are Qualified Persons and willing to serve as Independent Directors), then the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate any Qualified Person to fill each such vacancy and each such designated Qualified Person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or (ii) if no Independent Directors remain for any reason, the other directors shall be required to designate three (3) Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

Parents designees under _Section 1.3_. The provisions of _Section 1.3_ are

 Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) _Top-Up Option_. Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_ and _Section 1.4(c)_, the Company grants to Purchaser an irrevocable and non-transferable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), to purchase from the Company such number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one (1) share of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the outstanding Shares after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

      ##### 

  

    

Upon Purchasers request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to
certify in writing to Purchaser the number of Shares outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Purchaser, in whole and not in part, only once, at any time during the ten (10) Business Day period next following the Offer Closing (and if there shall have been commenced a subsequent offering period as contemplated by _Section 1.1(d)_, after the expiration of such subsequent offering period);  _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) any provision of applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority shall prohibit such exercise, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority in connection with such exercise or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, if such action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or notification has not theretofore been obtained or made or (iii) the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.1(c)_ and _Section 6.1(d)_ are not satisfied as of the time of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares then-subject to the Top-Up Option by the Offer Price. Such purchase price shall be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at Parents or Purchasers election, by either (1) paying in cash an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares which shall be allocated to the Companys stated (or "paid-in") capital account and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ ") having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price which balance shall be allocated to the Companys "additional capital" account or (2) executing and delivering a Promissory Note for the full purchase price. The Promissory Note (A) shall be due on the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (B) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, (C) shall be full recourse to Parent and Purchaser, (D) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (E) shall have no other material terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may elect to pay (or cause to be paid) all or a portion of the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased by Purchaser in cash and in connection therewith, the Company shall apply such cash proceeds (without the deduction of any other fee or expense) toward an Optional Redemption of the 12% Notes in the manner directed by Parent. 

   

 (c) _Top-Up Notice; Top-Up Option Closing_. In the event Purchaser elects, subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.4_ to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth (i) its election to so exercise and purchase the Top-Up Option Shares then-subject to the Top-Up Option, and (ii) the place (if other than as set forth in _Section 2.2_) and time at which the simultaneous exercise and purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares by 

      ##### 

  

    

Purchaser is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Purchaser that in addition to the provisions
of _Section 1.4(b)_, it shall be a condition to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option that, simultaneously with such exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, simultaneously consummate the Merger in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 5.4(e)_. At the
simultaneous exercise and purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up
Closing_ "), Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares and consummation of the Merger, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The
parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause (A) the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, (B) the issuance and closing of the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (C) the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 5.4(e)_
to occur simultaneously. 

   

 (d) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Purchaser will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an " _accredited investor_ ", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 (e) _No Impact on Appraisal Rights_. Any impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by  _Section 2.9_. 

   

 Section 1.5 _Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement_. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party hereto becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties thereof and each of the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, filing with the SEC and (as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws) dissemination to the Companys stockholders of such amendment or supplement.

 Section 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) The Company Certificate of Incorporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in the Merger to be in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Company Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in the Merger to be in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto and,

thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.7 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of Purchaser or the Company: 

  

 (a) Each share of capital stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) Each Share (other than (i) Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_ and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes and without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 (d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the effect of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to the Shares occurring or having a record date on or after 

    ##### 

  

 

the date of this Agreement and prior to the payment of the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ that this _Section 2.7(d)_ shall not affect or
supersede the provisions of _Section 5.1_. 

   

 Section 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of holders of Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent, pending its disbursement to such holders, shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in one or more Permitted Investments. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the amount required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), whose shares were converted pursuant to  _Section 2.7_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an " _agent s message_" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall have established 

      ##### 

  

    

to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 2.8_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_, without interest. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.8(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

   

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following nine (9) months after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled, at Parents option, to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of all Liens of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Options, Restricted Shares or Company Warrants pursuant to the Offer or Merger such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (including any income Tax Law or other Tax Law).

From and after the Effective Time, any such Company Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof for any shares of Company Common Stock or capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, but shall entitle such holder only to the payment of the Warrant Consideration upon exercise of such Company Warrant. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall take all necessary action under the Company Warrants (including, to the extent necessary, obtaining consent of the holders of the Company Warrants) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.11_ and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Warrant until any necessary consents are obtained.

 (e) _Change of Recommendation_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company Board shall not be permitted to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _7.1(c)(ii)_ unless theretofore (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent

terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, and in the case
of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change not being made in respect of a
Superior Proposal, specifying the reasons therefor (a " _Notice of
Intended Recommendation Change_ ") and (y): 

  

 (i) if such Company Adverse Recommendation Change is not being made in respect of a Superior Proposal, during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would enable the Company Board to determine in good faith, After Consultation, that it is no longer necessary for the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or 

  

 (ii) if such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination is being made in respect of a Superior Proposal: 

  

 (1) the Notice of Intended Recommendation Change shall further specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal (it being hereby understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any amendment to any price term thereof), shall require a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change and again require compliance with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(e)_, except that the advance written notice period and corresponding references in clause (x) of this _Section 5.2(e)_ to three (3) Business Days shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days for any such new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change); and 

  

 (2) after providing the Notice of Intended Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent and Purchaser have notified the Company of their intention to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day period in the case of a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change) to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby; and 

  

 (iii) in the case of each of the immediately preceding clause (i) or clause (ii) of this  _Section 5.2(e)_, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith, After Consultation, any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any increase in the Offer Price and Merger Consideration) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day of such three (3) Business Day period (or the first (1st) Business Day of such two (2) Business Day period for any such new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change) and shall have determined (A) in the case of a Superior Proposal, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to 

   ##### 

  

    

constitute a Superior Proposal if such amendments were to be given effect or
(B) in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change not being made in
respect of a Superior Proposal, no amendment to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement has been so offered by Parent which, if given effect, would
enable the Company Board to determine in good faith, After Consultation,
that it is no longer necessary for the Company Board to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

 (f) _Standstills; Confidentiality Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company Board shall be permitted to grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement in effect on the date hereof with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company solely to the extent necessary to permit the Person subject to such standstill agreement to make and engage in discussions with respect to and negotiate a Takeover Proposal that is conditioned on entering into mutually satisfactory definitive documentation with the Company and which prohibits without the Companys consent (but in all cases subject to the limitations in  _Section 5.1_) any open market purchases of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities of the Company, any Takeover Proposal not approved by the Company Board or other action, including a proxy contest, not approved by the Company Board. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver of any standstill by the Company.

 (c) If following the Offer Closing or Offer Termination this Agreement has not been validly terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, then the Company shall have the right at any time after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date to (and Parent and Purchaser shall have the right, at any time after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, to request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of such written request, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt), (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_"), and (ii) mail to the holders of Shares as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting a Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects to take such action or is required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ "). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be held later than thirty-five (35) days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders and any adjournments of such meetings shall require the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be 

   ##### 

  

    

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other than in the case in which
the Company is required to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC or its
staff has instructed the Company is necessary under applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by the holders of Shares prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may require the Company to adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders Meeting on one occasion only (for a period of not more than
thirty (30) days but, in no event, to a date subsequent to the second (2nd)
Business Day next preceding the Walk-Away Date), unless prior to such
adjournment the Company shall have received from holders of Shares as of the
record date for the Stockholders Meeting an aggregate number of proxies
representing Shares voted for the adoption of this Agreement and
the Transactions (including the Merger) which proxies have not been
withdrawn, such that the condition in _Section 6.1(a)_ would be satisfied at
the Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for
the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent (which such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law
or the Company Charter Documents. Unless the Company Board shall have made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the holders of Shares for the
adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
all applicable Laws (including all applicable rules of Nasdaq). Unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_
(including the provisions of  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_), the Company shall
submit this Agreement to holders of Shares at the Stockholders Meeting even
if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (not made in respect of a Superior Proposal) or proposed or announced
any intention to do so. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7)
Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting as to the
aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) shall
be the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors is known by the Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer Closing, the expiration of any " _subsequent offering period_ " as contemplated by _Section 1.1(d)_ and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Affiliates shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class and series of outstanding capital stock of the Company, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Purchaser of all Shares held by Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 (f) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall affirmatively vote at the Stockholders Meeting or otherwise all Shares acquired in the Offer (if any), or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date, for the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Purchaser beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders of Purchaser, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(g)_, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with, or applicable rules of, a national securities exchange, Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such issuance or publication). 

  

 Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Standstill_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws (and the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document proposed to be filed or submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such filing) and a copy of any communication (including " _comment letters_ ") received by the Company from the SEC or Nasdaq concerning compliance with securities Laws or the 

   ##### 

  

 

rules of Nasdaq and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. The information provided will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2010, between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No investigation, or
information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ will modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Company. Parent and Purchaser hereby
agree, from and after the date hereof until the Offer Closing, not to offer
or arrange to purchase or acquire, or purchase or acquire, any Shares or any
rights thereto or interests therein (whether or not any such interests are
evidenced or settled by the physical delivery of certificates or other
documents evidencing the same), except pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect to be untrue and (B) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any material respect, and (iv) any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurred, the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to the negotiation, execution, announcement, performance and consummation of all Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all actions of each Indemnitee leading thereto and in furtherance thereof on behalf of the Company and holders of Shares), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, (A) each Indemnitee will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from
the Indemnitee of a request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by the DGCL or the Company Charter Documents, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Surviving Corporation as authorized by the DGCL, (B) without limiting the
foregoing, the Indemnitees may retain one (1) independent legal counsel of
national standing ( _provided_ that such engagement would not create a
conflict of interest under applicable rules of ethics) reasonably satisfactory
to Parent to represent all Indemnitees, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnitees as promptly as statements therefor are received, (C) the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnitee hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents and (D) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
assume the defense of any such matter. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation determines such Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 5.8_, the Indemnitee shall have the right,
as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be
reconsidered and determined by special, independent legal counsel selected by
the Indemnitee and approved by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for the
Company or the Surviving Corporation within the three (3) years preceding
such selection to be paid by the Company or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if it is determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification by the Company (and
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) under this _Section
5.8_, such Indemnitee shall be obligated to repay the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, the expenses incurred for such special,
independent legal counsel. For purposes of this Agreement, each individual
who is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Company Charter Documents,
the DGCL or those indemnification agreements listed in _Section 5.8(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ at or at any time prior to the Effective
Time shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnitee_ ". 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or governing documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnitees for periods prior to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter Documents and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or similar organizational and governing documents 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Company Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, the covenants contained in this _Section
5.8_. 

  

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and extend all existing officers and directors liability insurance of the Company (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising in whole or in part from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may substitute (or cause the Surviving Corporation to substitute) therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the Indemnitees than the existing DandO Insurance (so long as such policies are provided by the Companys current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than A.M. Best rating of A); and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period through no fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and maintain substantially similar DandO Insurance (with such replacement policies to be provided by the Companys current insurance carrier or by a carrier with a rating no lower than A.M. Best rating of A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this _Section 5.8(c)_ in excess of 200% of the most recent aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), the true and correct amount of which is set forth in _Section 5.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ ; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by this _Section 5.8(c)_ for such aggregate premium, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate premiums not in excess of the Maximum Amount. At the Companys option, it may elect to obtain prepaid " _tail_ " or " _runoff_ " policies prior to the Effective Time covering a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to acts and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that the premium therefor does not exceed the Maximum Amount. In the event the Company purchases a " _tail_ " or " _runoff_ " policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such tail or runoff policy in full force and effect in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the first sentence of this Section _5.8(c)_ for so long as any such tail or runoff policy remains in full force and effect. 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnitee may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization or governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. Subsequent amendment of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall not diminish or impair the rights of any Indemnitee. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.8_. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger. The Indemnitees (and their respective successors and heirs) are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_, and this _Section 5.8_ shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnitees (including their respective successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Indemnitees (including their respective successors and heirs) affected thereby. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall jointly participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions in accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement. The Company may not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any securityholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 5.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated. Other than any Taxes imposed upon a holder of Shares, Options, Restricted Shares or Company Warrants, the Company shall pay all Taxes incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions (including (a) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (b) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other or similar Taxes or fees). 

  

 Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Indebtedness_. At any time upon or after the Offer Closing and upon or prior to the Effective Time, or prior to the Offer Closing (provided any such action becomes effective only upon or after the Offer Closing), in Parents sole discretion and at Parents sole cost and expense, (i) Parent may commence one or more cash tender 

   ##### 

  

 

offers (each, a " _Debt Offer_ ") to purchase any or all of the Companys 9.5%
Senior Secured Second Lien Notes (the " _9.5% Notes_ "), the Companys 12%
Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the " _12% Notes_ ") or the Companys 6.625%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 (the " _Convertible Notes_ " and, together
with the 9.5% Notes and the 12% Notes, the " _Notes_ "), (ii) Parent may, or,
at Parents request, the Company shall, solicit the consents of holders of
one or more series of the Notes (each, a " _Consent Solicitation_ ") to
certain amendments, as specified by Parent, to the covenants contained in the
9.5% Indenture, the 12% Indenture or the Convertible Notes Indenture, (iii)
at Parents request, the Company shall take all steps necessary under the
satisfaction and discharge provisions of the 9.5% Indenture or the
12% Indenture to discharge such indenture in accordance with its terms,
including the issuance of a notice of redemption for the 9.5% Notes or 12%
Notes as applicable and the deposit of required funds with the trustee (each,
a " _Satisfaction and Discharge_ "), (iv) at Parents request, the Company
shall effect a redemption of such principal amount of the 9.5% Notes or 12%
Notes, as specified by Parent, in accordance with their terms (each, a "
_Optional Redemption_ ") or (v) at Parents request, in addition to the
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Top-Up
Option, to the extent authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock
are available for such issuance, the Company shall issue equity securities to
Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries on terms and conditions as may
reasonably be agreed (which may include the issuance of shares of Company
Common Stock at a price per share equal to the Offer Price) and use the
cash proceeds (without the deduction of any other fee or expense) of such
equity issuance toward an Optional Redemption of the 12% Notes pursuant to
the provisions of the 12% Indenture as instructed by Parent (an " _Equity
Issuance_ "). Any Debt Offer, Consent Solicitation, Satisfaction
and Discharge, Optional Redemption or Equity Issuance shall be made in
accordance with applicable Laws and each applicable Indenture and, if being
conducted by the Company at the request of Parent, shall be made in
accordance with the written terms and conditions provided from time to time
by Parent to the Company. If any Debt Offer, Satisfaction and Discharge or
Optional Redemption is effected by the Company at the request of the Parent
under this _Section 5.12_ and the Company does not have sufficient funds on
hand to consummate such Debt Offer, Satisfaction and Discharge or Optional
Redemption, Parent shall provide the requisite amount of funds to the
Company on terms and conditions as may reasonably be agreed (including
through the issuance of equity or debt securities to Parent or a Subsidiary
of Parent) upon and in compliance with the applicable Indentures and all
applicable Laws. The Company shall not, without Parents prior consent,
waive any condition to a Debt Offer, Consent Solicitation, Satisfaction and
Discharge, Optional Redemption or Equity Issuance described in the written
terms and conditions provided by Parent to the Company from time to time. The
Company shall not enter into any arrangements in connection with a Debt Offer
(including any engagement or similar agreements with any dealer
manager, information agent, depository or other agent) without the prior
written consent of Parent. If any Consent Solicitation is made in connection
with any Debt Offer conducted by Parent, the Company shall take such steps as
Parent may reasonably request in order to effect the amendments requested by
the Consent Solicitation, including the entry into any supplemental indenture
and the provision of any required certificate or opinion. With 

      ##### 

  

    

respect to any Debt Offer, Consent Solicitation, Satisfaction and Discharge,
Optional Redemption or Equity Issuance, the Company agrees to provide all
documentation (including any required certificates or customary legal
opinions) to the trustee required by the terms of the applicable
Indentures. 

   

 Section 5.13 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues as an employee of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), for a period extending until the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employees employment with such entities or the last day of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ ") (i) a base wage or salary at a rate not less than the rate of such base wage or salary in effect at the Effective Time and (ii) 401(k) benefits, severance benefit eligibility, medical benefits and other welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements that, as determined in Parents discretion, (A) are substantially comparable to those provided under the Company Plans as in effect at the Effective Time; (B) are substantially comparable to those provided to management employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries; or (C) constitute any combination of the foregoing. With respect to each Continuing Employee whose annual bonus for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 has been accrued and unpaid prior to the Effective Time and who is eligible to receive an annual bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Plan, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to such Continuing Employee such bonus in such amount as approved by the Company and which bonus shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Company Plan and shall be paid at such time as is consistent with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries and without duplication of awards otherwise paid including pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)(v)_. The provisions of this  _Section 5.13_ shall not be construed or interpreted to restrict in any way the Surviving Corporations or Parents ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan (including to change the entities who administer such Company Plans, or the manner in which such Company Plans are administered) to the extent not inconsistent with such foregoing restrictions or any other plan made available to the Continuing Employees or to terminate any persons employment at any time or for any reason. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is eligible to participate in immediately following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Company Plan in which such employee participated, (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements and (iii) to the extent 

   ##### 

  

    

that any Continuing Employee is allowed to participate in any employee benefit
plan of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of
such Continuing Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but
not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit, retiree welfare or any
other plan) to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company and
its Subsidiaries under any similar Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or other
relevant Subsidiaries to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of
vacation time that such employees had accrued under the Paid-Time Off Program,
set forth on _Section 5.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, as of the
Effective Time; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, this covenant
shall not obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiaries to
continue such Paid-Time Off Program beyond the last day of the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (i) shall, in consultation with its outside counsel, use its reasonable best efforts to amend all Company Plans that are "nonqualified deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) to the extent necessary to bring such plans into compliance with Section 409A of the Code and related guidance and (ii) shall disclose to all affected participants the tax and economic consequences of Section 409A of the Code, including any amendments that are required to be made pursuant to (i) above and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents to such amendments by the affected participants. The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such actions and communications in connection with this _Section 5.13(c)_ and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to such comments suggested by Parent. 

  

 (d) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.13_, the Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any written notices or other communication materials (including any postings to any website) to its employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to such employees or former employees for purposes of Parent providing notices or other communication materials regarding Parent compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this _Section 5.13_; _provided_ that such notices or other communication materials are approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (i) provide any and all notices to, (ii) make any and all filings or registrations with, and (iii) obtain any and all consents or approvals of, any labor organization, works council or any similar entity, council or organization, 

   ##### 

  

    

required to be made or obtained in connection with this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.13_ shall create any third-party beneficiary right in any Person, or any right to employment or continued employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to amend or modify any compensation or benefit plan, policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Rule 14d-10_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or will be entered into after the date of this Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Tax Matters_. As expeditiously as possible following the date hereof, the Company shall complete a study to determine whether the Company is, or within the five (5) years preceding the date hereof was, a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. If it is determined that the Company is not, and within such period was not, a United States real property holding corporation, the Company shall promptly issue a statement described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(1) to such effect to Parent. 

  

ARTICLE VI 

   

 _Conditions to the Merger_  

  

 Section 6.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions: 

  

 (a) _Stockholder Approval_. If required by applicable Law, Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained; _provided_ that this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval is due to Parents failure to vote all Shares it beneficially owns for the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Antitrust_. The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger and, unless the Offer Termination shall have occurred, the Offer under the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) shall have expired or early termination thereof shall have been granted;

and 

  

 (d) _Purchase of Shares_. Unless the Offer Termination shall have occurred, Purchaser shall have purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer, _provided_ that this condition shall be deemed satisfied with respect to Parent and Purchaser if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer in breach of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Solely if the Offer Termination shall have occurred or the Offer Closing shall not have occurred, the obligations of Parent and Purchaser to effect the Merger are further subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

(i) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.3(a)_ (Authority), _Section 3.3(d)_ (Required Vote),  _Section 3.6(a)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events), _Section 3.23_ (Indebtedness),  _Section 3.24_ (Opinion of Financial Advisor), _Section 3.25_ (Brokers and Other Advisors) and _Section 3.26_ (Anti-Takeover Provisions) shall be true and correct in all respects, in each case both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization) shall be true and correct in all respects, other than immaterial deviations, both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time; and (iii) all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein shall be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except, in the case of this clause (iii), where the failure of such representations and warranties to not be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to " _materiality_ " or " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " set forth therein) does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer thereof to such effect. 

  

 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Company_. The Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects with its obligations, agreements or covenants required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer thereof to such effect.

   ##### 

  

    

Adverse Effect, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
thereof to such effect. 

  

 Section 6.3 _Conditions to Obligation of the Company to Effect the Merger_.

 (a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to " _materiality_ ", " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer thereof to such effect. 

  

 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Parent and Purchaser shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

None of the Company, Parent or Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 6.1_, _6.2_  or _6.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, as required by and subject to _Section 5.3_. 

  

ARTICLE VII 

   

 _Termination_  

  

 Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

 (ii) if the Offer shall have been terminated by Purchaser as permitted by _Section 1.1(c)_ or shall have expired pursuant to its terms (and not have been extended or required to have been extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_) without any Shares being purchased therein, _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement resulted in the failure of Purchaser to purchase Shares in the Offer; 

  

 (iii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to any party if (A) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (B) the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Merger to be so consummated by the Walk-Away Date; or

 (c) by the Company:

 (ii) if the Company enters into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.2_ immediately following or simultaneously with such termination pursuant to this _Section_  

   #####

other requirements of _Section 5.2_; provided that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

 (iii) if there shall be any breach or inaccuracy in any of Parents or Purchasers representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement or Parent or Purchaser has failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ and (B) (1) is not capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date or (2) is not cured within thirty (30) days following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ if (x) the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, (y) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (z) the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained. 

  

 (d) by Parent: 

  

 (i) if, due to a circumstance or occurrence that if occurring after the commencement of the Offer would make it impossible to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of Annex A, Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the date provided therefor in _Section 1.1(a)_; _provided_ , that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or Purchaser is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have been made, or (A) following the public disclosure or announcement of a Takeover Proposal (other than a tender offer or exchange offer contemplated in clause (B)) the Company Board shall have failed to reconfirm publicly the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after the Company receives Parents written request therefor or (B) a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Shares is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) and, not later than the tenth (10th) day next following such commencement, the Company shall not have publicly announced its recommendation that holders of Shares reject such tender offer or exchange offer (it being hereby understood and agreed that for purposes of this clause (B) of this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ , the Companys public disclosure or announcement of a position pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act with respect to such tender offer or exchange offer shall be deemed a failure by the Company to publicly disclose or announce the rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _7.1(d)(ii)_ if (x) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (y) the Company
Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained; or 

  

 (iii) if there shall be any breach or inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement or the Company has failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise (x) if the Offer Termination shall have occurred, to the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ or (y) if the Offer Termination shall not have occurred, to the failure of any Offer Condition set forth in clauses (c)(ii) or (d) of Annex A, and (B) (1) is not capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date or (2) is not cured within thirty (30) days following Parents delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach;  _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ if (a) Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or (b) the Offer Closing shall have occurred. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than _Sections 5.9_, _5.10_ , this  _7.2_ and _7.3_ , _Article VIII_ and the first sentence of _Section 3.25_, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (i) the Company shall have liability to the extent provided in _Section 7.3_, and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for any damages for a knowing and intentional material breach of a representation or warranty or a knowing and intentional material breach of any obligation hereunder made or allowed to occur or fraud. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the failure of Parent and Purchaser to consummate Offer or the Merger on the dates required by  _Article I_ or _Article II_, as applicable, after the applicable conditions set forth in this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Closing or the Closing, as the case may be, and which are capable of being satisfied on the date of the Offer Closing or the Closing Date, as applicable, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is the date of the Offer Closing or the Closing Date, as applicable) have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a knowing and intentional material breach by Parent and Purchaser. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Termination Fee and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) In the event that: 

  

 (i) (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ (Company Breach) or (B)(1) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company and publicly disclosed or shall have been made directly to its stockholders and not withdrawn or any Person shall have publicly announced and not withdrawn an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and 

   ##### 

  

    

thereafter and (2) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ (Offer Expires), _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_
(Walk-Away Date) or  _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ (Company Stockholder Approval),
then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all documented Expenses (it being
understood that the payment of such Expenses is not an exclusive remedy, but
is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Parent to
the extent permitted by this Agreement (whether at law or equity)); 

  

 (ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company and publicly disclosed or shall have been made directly to its stockholders and not withdrawn or any Person shall have publicly announced and not withdrawn an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ (Offer Expires), _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ (Walk-Away Date) or  _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ (Company Stockholder Approval) or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ (Company Breach) and (C) the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or consummates any Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement is terminated; _provided_ , that solely for this _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_, all references to 20% in the definition of " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to 50.1%; 

  

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ (Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Etc.); or 

  

 (iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ (Superior Proposal); 

 

then in any such event under clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this _Section
7.3(a)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee. 

   

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following the consummation of any transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(iii)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ (and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to  _Section 7.3(a)(iv)_ shall be made to Parent simultaneously with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of) termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ ; and, in circumstances in which Expenses are payable, such payment shall be made to Parent not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of an itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all Expenses of Parent and Purchaser (which itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by such party until the sixtieth (60th) day after such party delivers such notice of demand for payment). All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. If both Expenses and the Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

 

this _Section 7.3_, the Termination Fee shall be reduced by the amount of
such Expenses actually paid. 

   

 (c) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Expenses required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such Termination Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Termination Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from time to time during such period, as such banks prime lending rate plus 4%. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such Termination Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parents costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such Termination Fee or Expenses, as the case may be. The Company acknowledges that the fee, Expenses and the other provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. 

  

 (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred, and in the event that Parent shall receive full payment pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, and not a penalty, for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to pay more than one (1) Termination Fee.

 _Miscellaneous_

The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, as the case may be, except that the 

   ##### 

  

 

agreements set forth in _Article II_, _Sections 5.8_, _5.10_ and
_Section 5.13_ and any other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates
performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time
indefinitely and those set forth in _Sections 5.9_ , _5.10_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_
and this _Article VIII_ shall survive termination indefinitely. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in

 Section 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors (which in the case of the Company after the Offer Closing shall include the Independent Director Approval contemplated by _Section 1.3_); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys conditions; _provided_ , _that_ , in the case of the Company following the Offer Closing, the Independent Director Approval contemplated by _Section 1.3_ is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign its rights and interests hereunder to Parent or to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent if such assignment would not cause a delay in the consummation of any of the Transactions, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and void. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Counterparts; Scanned Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective 

   ##### 

  

 

when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Facsimile or other electronically scanned and
transmitted signatures shall be deemed originals for all purposes of this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Representations; Disclosure_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement, together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Support Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (ii) except for the provisions of  _Section 5.8_, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, the provisions of _Article II_ relating solely to the payment of the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and Warrant Consideration shall be enforceable by holders of Shares, Restricted Shares, Options and Company Warrants, as applicable, solely to receive such payment. 

  

 (b) Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties contained in  _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement, neither the Company, Parent or Purchaser makes any other representations or warranties and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties made by itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other partys Representatives of any document or other information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary makes or has made any representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any Company Subsidiary heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, or (ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, including the information in the VDR, with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (i) the corresponding section of this Agreement and (ii) the other sections of this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Company SEC Documents shall qualify the representations and warranties in
_Article III_ only to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it qualifies or applies to such representation or
warranty. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material, constitutes or has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the
ordinary course of business. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law rules thereof that would result in the application of the Law of any other jurisdiction. 

  

 (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be exclusively heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. 

  

 (c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 _Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees and other Corporate
Agents_  

 

 SECTION 1. _Action, Etc., Other Than By or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of a subsidiary of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (all such persons being referred to hereinafter as an "Agent"), against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

  

 SECTION 2. _Action, Etc., By or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was an Agent against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, unless and only

    ##### 

  

     

to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall
deem proper. 

  

 SECTION 3. _Determination of Right of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances because the Agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V, which determination is made (a) by the Board of Directors, by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.

  

 SECTION 4. _Indemnification Against Expenses of Succesful Party_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article V, to the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Agent shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys fees actually and reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection therewith.

  

 SECTION 5. _Advances of Expenses_. Except as limited by Section 6 of this Article V, expenses incurred by an Agent in defending any civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if the Agent shall undertake to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article V. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the Board of Directors or counsel at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

  

 SECTION 6. _Right of Agent to Indemnification upon Application; Procedure upon Application_. Any indemnification or advance under this Article V shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety (90) days, upon the written request of the Agent, unless a determination shall be made in the manner set forth in the second sentence of Section 5 of this Article V hereof that such Agent acted in a manner set forth therein so as to justify the Corporations not indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. The

    ##### 

  

     

right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article V shall be
enforceable by the Agent in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Board
of Directors or independent legal counsel denies the claim, in whole or in
part, or if no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days. The
Agents expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing
his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding
shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 7. _Other Rights and Remedies_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Agent seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. All rights to indemnification under this Article V shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Corporation and the Agent who serves in such capacity at any time while these Bylaws and other relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.

  

 SECTION 8. _Insurance_. Upon resolution passed by the Board of Directors, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

  

 SECTION 9. _Constituent Corporations_. For the purposes of this Article V, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, all constituent corporations (including all constituents of constituents) absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, which, if the separate existence of such constituent corporation had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its Agents, so that any Agent of such constituent corporation shall stand in the same position under the provisions of the Article V with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as that Agent would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

  

 SECTION 10. _Other Enterprises, Fines, and Serving at Corporation s Request_. For purposes of this Article V, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed

    ##### 

  

     

to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article V. 

  

 SECTION 11. _Savings Clause_. If this Article V or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent as to expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article V that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

  

 (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the

    ##### 

  

     

resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and
which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
required, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in this State, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by this chapter, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 

  

 (c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any and all signatures on any such certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

record of the shares represented thereby, with the number of such shares and
the date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 2. _Transfers of Stock_.

The Corporation may, but shall not be required to, issue certificates for fractions of a share where necessary to effect authorized transactions, or the Corporation may pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or it may issue scrip in registered or bearer form over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the Corporation or of its agent, exchangeable as therein provided for full shares, but such scrip shall not entitle the holder to any rights of a stockholder except as therein provided.

 SECTION 4. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.
