 **WHEREAS,** in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent,
Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, all of the outstanding
shares of (i) common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(together with the associated preferred share purchase rights under the
Company Rights Agreement (as defined herein), the " _Common Shares_ "), at a

as the " _Common Offer Price_ "), and (ii) Series D Non-Cumulative Delivery
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Series D

or the Series D Offer Price, as applicable, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub
will cease to exist and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of

the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  



  

 **WHEREAS,** concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as
inducement of Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the
Major Shareholders is entering into a tender and support agreement (each, a "
_Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other

  



        
   

  



  

things, each Major Shareholder has agreed to tender all Company Shares it
beneficially owns into the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in the Support Agreements;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as
inducement of the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Viterra Inc., **** a corporation incorporated under the laws of Province of
Saskatchewan and the indirect beneficial owner of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Parent (" _Guarantor_ "), is issuing a guarantee
(the " _Guarantee_ ") of all of Parents obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS,** the Company Board has unanimously approved the execution and
delivery of the Support Agreements; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS,** each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer
and the Merger.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree as follows:

### (a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to _Article 8_ , not prior to March 23, 2010 and not
later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 24, 2010, Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase (i) all of the
Common Shares at a price per share equal to the Common Offer Price
(as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ , if applicable) and (ii) all of
the Series D Shares at a price per share equal to the Series D Offer Price
(as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ , if applicable).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Merger Sub to
accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares tendered (and the
obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for
any Company Shares tendered) in the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the
condition that, prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer (as
it may be extended from time to time pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_ ), there be
validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of Common Shares that, together
with the Common Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any), and
without giving effect to any Common Shares held in treasury, represents more
than 50% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number as of immediately prior to
the Merger Subs acceptance for payment of the Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), and (ii) the other conditions set forth
on _Exhibit B_.  The conditions to the Offer set forth on _Exhibit B_ are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or
Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their
sole discretion; _provided_ that the Minimum Condition may be amended or
waived by Parent or Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Company. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase
the Common Offer Price or the Series D Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that
unless previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub may make any change to the terms or conditions of the Offer that
(A) decreases the Common Offer Price or the Series D Offer Price (other than
any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_ ), (B) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (C) reduces the number of Common
Shares or Series D Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth on _Exhibit B_ , (E)
amends the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Exhibit B_ so as to broaden
the scope of such conditions to the Offer, or (F) reduces the time period
during which the Offer shall remain open or extends the Offer in any manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.1(d)_ ,
or otherwise amends any other term or condition of the Offer in a manner
adverse to holders of Company Shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Adjustments to the Offer Prices_. The Common Offer Price and the
Series D Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Shares or Series D
Shares, if applicable), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change
with respect to the Common Shares or the Series D Shares, as applicable,
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance
for payment (the time of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") of, and
payment for, the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time, on the 30th Business
Day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (the initial " _Expiration Date_ " and
any expiration time and date established pursuant to an authorized extension
of the Offer, as so extended, also an " _Expiration Date_ "). Without the
prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date except (i) as required by applicable Law
including any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff, (ii) if, prior to the initial Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition
or any of the other conditions to the Offer set forth on _Exhibit B_ have not
been satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub shall extend the Expiration
Date for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days (for this purpose calculated
in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) or (iii) if,
prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date (as the Expiration Date may be
extended from time to time including an extension pursuant to clause (ii) of
this _Section 1.1(d)_ ) the Minimum Condition or any other condition to the
Offer has not been satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub may, in their
sole discretion, extend the Expiration Date for one or more periods not in
excess of twenty (20) Business Days each (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and which period
shall not include the fifteen (15) Business Day period referred to in clause
(ii) above, but in no event beyond the Outside Date, the length of each such
period to be determined by Merger Sub in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if necessary to obtain a sufficient number of Common Shares
(without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up Option) to reach the Short-Form
Threshold, Parent and Merger Sub may elect, without the consent of the
Company, to provide a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions

  



        
   

  



  

### thereof) for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act following the acceptance of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Payment for Company Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein and the Offer (including the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Exhibit B_ ), Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Company
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly
as practicable after the Expiration Date (as it may be extended in accordance
with _Section 1.1(d)_ ) and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c)
under the Exchange Act. The Common Offer Price and the Series D Offer Price
payable as consideration for each Common Share or Series D Share, as
applicable, that is validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
or that is tendered during any subsequent offering period contemplated by
_Section 1.1(d)_ shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to
reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes
payable by such holder. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a
timely basis, the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Merger
Sub accepts or is obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. On the date the Offer is commenced
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO

Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Common Shares owned by Parent
and Merger Sub and any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately
prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one
share more than 90% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number immediately
after the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be
exercised at any time following the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon
the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i)
no Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction shall have issued or granted
any Order prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of
the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, and (ii) the issuance

Company), which shall be no later than two Business Days after the Acceptance
Time, at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn Street,
Chicago, Illinois, unless another time, date or place is agreed upon by the
parties hereto.  The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option

determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the
Common Offer Price. Such purchase price shall be paid by Merger Sub, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by executing and delivering

  



        
   

  



  

### to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the amount of such purchase price, or (iii) some combination of cash and
a promissory note. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate
of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from time to
time during such period as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ , shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery to the
Company of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or
penalty. The Company shall, at Merger Subs request, cause to be issued to
Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Option Shares will
not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance
upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that

local Tax Law, and the person making such deduction or withholding shall make
any required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any
such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and

the Series D Offer Price, as applicable, payable in respect therefor pursuant
to this _Article 2_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

by, the United States government and that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the former holders of Company Shares

Superior Proposal if the following conditions are met:

  



  

###### (1) in the case of any action described in either clauses (A) or (B)

Proposal during the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period of three days shall
be provided hereunder), (y) during the applicable Notice Period, if requested
by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent, and considered in
good faith the terms of any modifications to this Agreement proposed by
Parent, to amend this Agreement in such a manner that such Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (z) at the end of the
applicable Notice Period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn
and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent). For the avoidance
of doubt, no Notice of Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company
Recommendation Change; and

  

###### 

  

###### (3) in the case of clause (B) above, the Company (x) has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.1_ and (y)

Companys stockholders if the Company Board has reasonably determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure is

, that in no event shall this _Section 6.1(e)_ affect the obligations of
the Company specified in _Section 6.1(a)_, _(c)_ or _(d)_ ;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Recommendation, either in such communication or within five
Business Days after a request to do so from Parent.

  

### 

  

### (f) No Company Recommendation Change shall in any event change, or be
deemed to otherwise eliminate, the approval of the Company Board of this

Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition,
without a meeting of the holders of Common Shares, in accordance with Section
10-19.1-100 of the North Dakota Act.

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.3. _Proxy Statement_**.

  



  

### (a) If approval of the holders of Common Shares is required by applicable
Law in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section
10-19.1-100 of the North Dakota Act, as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and
file with the SEC, a proxy statement, letter to stockholders, notice of
meeting and form of proxy that will be provided to the holders of Company
Shares in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in
connection therewith (collectively, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "); _provided_ that, the foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC and shall make all reasonable changes to the Proxy Statement as
Parent shall request. Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent
and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the holders of Common Shares as
promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC.  The
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to, when filed with the SEC, comply
as to

  



        
   

  



  

### form in all material respects with all applicable federal
securities Laws. On the date the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to the holders of Common Shares and at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the parties hereto will cause the
Proxy Statement not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty is made by any party hereto
with respect to information supplied by any other party or any of such
partys Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence
with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement shall be made
by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon and making all reasonable changes requested by Parent.
The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the
Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by
the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith, and
shall provide copies of all written comments and summaries of any other
material communications that the Company or its counsel receives from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
consult in good faith with Parent prior to responding to any such comments
and shall make all reasonable changes as Parent shall request. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties,
as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the holders of Common Shares. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement,
as so amended or supplemented, to comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of all applicable federal
securities Laws.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject to the terms of _Section 6.1_, the Company shall include the
Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to the Offer) in the
Proxy Statement.

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.4. _Access to Information_**. During the Interim Period, upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law relating to privacy or the
exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, financial advisors, counsel and other representatives,
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may reasonably
request. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 6.4_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of any of the Acquired Companies
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of any of
the Acquired Companies. During such period, the Company shall furnish or make
available promptly to Parent (except as otherwise publicly available) (a)
a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to

  



        
   

  



  

the requirements of applicable federal securities Laws and (b) all
additional financing, operating and other data and information concerning the
Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective business, properties, assets
and personnel, as Parent may reasonably request. Parent will hold any such
information which is non-public in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to
the Offer or the Merger.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (i) access to such documents or information would risk waiver of
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information, (ii) access to a
Contract to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract (provided that the
Company or such Acquired Company, as the case may be, has used its reasonable
best efforts to find an alternative way to provide the access or information
contemplated by this _Section 6.4_), or (iii) access to such documents or
information would violate applicable Antitrust Laws.

  



  

 **Section 6.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.**

  



  

### (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) as promptly as practicable,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Offer set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 7_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain all
necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Material
Contracts in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), (iii)
obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals,
Orders and authorizations from Governmental Bodies, seek the expiration or
early termination of all applicable waiting periods under applicable Law, and
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Bodies;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent or Merger Sub to (and the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent) become subject to, or consent or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
undertaking, agreement or Order of a Governmental Body to sell, to divest, to
hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change, assets or businesses of the Company, Parent, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of
_Section 6.5(a)_, each of Parent and the Company shall file, as soon as may
be reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") a Notification and Report Form relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger) as required by the HSR

  



        
   

  



  

### Act, and, as soon as may be reasonably practical following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, any comparable pre-merger notification
filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Body that is
required by any other applicable Antitrust Law. Each of Parent and the Company
shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of
such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required
in order to effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction.
Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as
the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer
and the Merger).  If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable
best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. No party shall independently participate in any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any
Governmental Body in respect to any such filings, investigation or other
request without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body, the
opportunity to attend or participate.

  

### 

  

### (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that
any state anti-takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer
and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger).

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.6. _Public Disclosure_**. Except as may be required by
applicable Law or stock market regulations, and in such instance only after
prior consultation with the other parties hereto to the extent practicable
under the circumstances, until the Acceptance Time, neither Parent nor the
Company shall, and neither Parent nor the Company shall permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any
public statement concerning, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of
Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject
to this _Section 6.6_, the parties shall agree on the text of a joint press
release by which Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will announce
the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 6.7. _Certain Litigation_**. During the Interim Period, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of any Legal
Proceedings commenced or threatened in writing against it or any of its
directors, officers, or Affiliates, including by any stockholder of the
Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company), relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) and shall keep all

  



        
   

  



  

other parties hereto reasonably informed regarding any such Legal
Proceedings. Any party hereto defending any such Legal Proceedings shall give
the other parties hereto the opportunity to consult with it regarding the
defense or settlement of any such Legal Proceedings and shall consider such
other parties views with respect to such Legal Proceedings. The Company
agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle in exchange for the
payment of funds any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this
Agreement against it or any of its directors, officers, or Affiliates by any
stockholder of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be required to provide
any notice or information to any other party hereto, the provision of which
it has determined in good faith may adversely affect such partys, or
any other Persons, attorney client or other privilege with respect to
such information.

  



  

 **Section 6.8. _Indemnification_**.

  



  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of any of the
Acquired Companies (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or
expenses (including reimbursement for attorneys fees and other fees and
expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any Legal Proceeding
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any Legal Proceeding commenced within six years
following the Effective Time and arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist under the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Companies, the North Dakota Act (or comparable Law
applicable to any of the Acquired Companies) and any indemnification
agreements that any of the Acquired Companies is a party to, as long as a
copy of any such agreement was provided to Parent on or prior to the date
hereof (such agreements, the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation for periods prior to
and including the Effective Time that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained
in the Organizational Documents of the Company as of the date hereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in Parents sole discretion, either
(i) maintain in effect a directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of
which has been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) with
coverage in amount and scope, and containing terms and conditions, that are
at least as favorable to such Persons as the Companys existing coverage (the
" _D andO Insurance_"), or (ii) obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time

  



        
   

  



  

### for the Persons who are currently covered by the Companys existing DandO
Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that __ in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the cost for any such coverage
is in excess of such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to maintain the maximum amount of coverage that is available for
such amount. Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
such annual premium currently paid by the Company.

  

### 

  

### (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

  

### 

  

### (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Party (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Insurance and their heirs and representatives) without the prior
written consent of such adversely affected Indemnified Party or other Person
who is a beneficiary of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_
or under the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and representatives) and
is affected thereby. Each of the Indemnified Parties or other Persons who
are beneficiaries under the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_ or
the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.8_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The provisions
of this _Section 6.8_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise
available to the current officers and directors of the Acquired Companies
under the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, the North
Dakota Act (or comparable Law applicable to any of the Acquired Companies)
and the Indemnification Agreements and shall operate for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.9. _Employee Matters_**.

  



  

### (a) As of immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Acquired Companies to continue the employment of any Person who was an
employee of the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") on such terms and conditions as may be determined
by Parent in its sole discretion. Further, Parent shall, for a period of at
least six months following the Closing Date, provide (or cause to be
provided) to the Continuing Employees, compensation and benefit plans
providing compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) compensation and benefits, as well as other terms and
conditions of employment, provided to Continuing Employees who are members of
a collective bargaining unit shall satisfy the requirements of the applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement and (ii) Parent shall provide (or cause to be
provided) to any Continuing Employee severance benefits, if any, that are the
same

  



        
   

  



  

### as provided for a similarly situated employee in the same
jurisdiction under Parents severance policies in effect at the time of
termination of such Continuing Employee. Parent shall treat and cause its
applicable benefit plans to treat the service of the Continuing Employees
with the Acquired Companies prior to the Effective Time as service
rendered to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting, including applicability of minimum waiting periods
for participation and for purposes of benefit accrual other than in the case
of any defined benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Parent or its
Affiliates (but including with respect to vacation accruals and any severance
pay plans). Parent shall provide that, for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs, no Continuing Employee, or any of his or her eligible
dependents, who, at the Effective Time, are participating in an Acquired
Companys group health plan shall be excluded from Parents group health
plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period
restriction or pre-existing condition limitation as long as such Continuing
Employee enrolls in Parents group health plan within the time period
specified by the applicable plans. For the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs, Parent shall credit each Continuing Employee with any co-
payments and deductibles paid respectively by them under the Company
Benefit Plans toward satisfaction of any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under Parents group health plan.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing contained in
this _Section 6.9_ shall require or imply that the employment of any
employees of the Acquired Companies, including but not limited to the
Continuing Employees, will continue for any particular period of time
following the Effective Time. Except as set forth in this Section 6.9,
nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent from altering, amending, or
terminating any of its (or following the Closing Date, any Acquired
Companys) employee benefit plans, compensation programs, perquisites or
other arrangements. This _Section 6.9_ is not intended, and shall not be
deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any Person or to
otherwise create any third-party beneficiary rights hereunder, or to be
interpreted as an amendment to any plan of any Acquired Company or of Parent
or any of its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

### (c) For avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.9_ is not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to restrict or limit the rights of any of the Acquired
Companies to terminate the employment of any employee, before or after the
Effective Time.

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_**. Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, as applicable, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to
cause any condition set forth on _Exhibit B_ or _Article 7_ hereof to not
be satisfied, (b) the receipt of any material notice or other material
communication from any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any regulatory notice, report or result
of inspection from any Governmental Body received by the Company that would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company; or (d) any
Company Material Adverse Effect or any Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to
consummate the Offer or the Merger.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 6.11. _Tax Matters_**.

  



  

### (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, consistent with past
practice, each Acquired Company shall (i) duly and timely file all material
Tax Returns and other documents required to be filed by it with any
Governmental Body, subject to extensions permitted by Law and properly
granted by the appropriate Governmental Body; _provided_ that the Company
notifies Parent that an Acquired Company is availing itself of
such extensions, and (ii) pay all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each party hereto shall reasonably cooperate with the other in the
preparation, execution, and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications, or other documents regarding any transfer, gains, sales, use,
value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any recording, registration and
other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger). All
transfer taxes imposed on an Acquired Company as a result of the indirect
sale and transfer of any Company Real Property as a result of the Offer and
Merger, shall be paid by Parent. From the date hereof through the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to provide the other with
any Tax information reasonably requested by such party.

  

### 

  

 **Section 6.12. _Parent Disclaimer of Other Representations, Warranties or
Guarantees_**. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that, other than the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Company does not, and shall not be deemed to have made, and hereby disclaims,
any representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, including as
to any financial forecast, revenue projection or financial model or other
prospective information made available by the Acquired Companies or the
Company Representatives to Parent or its representatives or other information
with respect to the Acquired Companies or their assets, products, properties
or business. It is understood and agreed that Parent is solely responsible
for developing for itself, together with its representatives, any such
financial forecasts, revenue projections and financial models and assessing
any prospective events concerning the Acquired Companies in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger).

  



  

 **Section 6.13. _Confidentiality_**. The parties acknowledge that the
Guarantor and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality
agreement dated as of May 20, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties thereto or as expressly modified hereby.

  



  

 **Section 6.14. _Rule 16b-3 Matters_.** Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board, or a committee thereof, shall take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of equity securities
in the Company pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempted
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

 **Section 6.15. _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_.** Prior to the Acceptance Time
and to the extent permitted by Law, the Company Board, or a committee
thereof, shall take all such steps as may

  



        
   

  



  

be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered
into by any of the Acquired Companies on or after the date hereof with any
Covered Stockholder pursuant to which compensation is paid to such Covered
Stockholder to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

 **Section 6.16. _Title Commitments; Surveys; Title Insurance Policies_.**

  



  

### (a) Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, the
Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Parent, or cooperate with Parent in obtaining for Parent, title commitments
for owners policies of title insurance (each, a " _Title Commitment_ ")
prepared by a national title insurance company reasonably acceptable to the
Acquired Companies and Parent (" _Title Company_ "), with respect to each of
the Owned Real Properties. Within forty-five days after the date of
this Agreement, the Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Parent, or cooperate with Parent in obtaining for
Parent, certified ALTA surveys prepared by surveyors reasonably acceptable to
the Acquired Companies and Parent (each, a " _Survey_ "), with respect to
each of the Owned Real Properties. The Acquired Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, at or prior to the Acceptance
Time, any affidavits, documents and instruments as may be reasonably
necessary, advisable, customary or required by the Title Company to issue the
title insurance policies, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, including, without limitation, any and all real estate
transfer declarations (if any), ALTA owners affidavits, GAP Undertakings,

Title Company or Parent (the " _Title Company Documents_ ") and final dated-
down Title Commitments (for the issuance of final title policies).

  

### 

  

### (b) The Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Parent, or cooperate with Parent in obtaining for Parent, (or the
Title Company, for the Title Company Documents):  (a) a final owners title
insurance policy for each parcel of Owned Real Property complying with
_Section 6.16(a)_, based on the Title Commitments issued pursuant to
_Section 6.16(a)_ reflecting that the respective Company or Company
Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall be vested with good, marketable and fee
simple title to such Owned Real Property, subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances; (b) a final Survey for each parcel of Owned Real Property
contained in Section 3.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule complying with
_Section 6.16(a)_ certified to Parent and lender of Parent; and (c) Title
Company Documents.

#### (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement under _Section

_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ ( _provided_ Parent would also have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ at the time of such
termination by the Company) or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_
and (B) prior to such termination (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to the public or to the Company Board or shall have been
made directly to the stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have
publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn (or if publicly withdrawn, not

 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

  

# ** **

  

 **Section 9.1. _Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended at any
time prior to the Effective Time by the parties hereto, whether before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Common Shares; _provided,
however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval (if any),
if any such amendment shall by applicable Law require further approval or by
any of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment
shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate stockholders of the
Company.  This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

  



  

 **Section 9.2. _Remedies Cumulative; Waiver_**. The rights and remedies of
the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any
failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given.

  



  

 **Section 9.3. _No Survival; Representations and Warranties_**. None of
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive

The representations, warranties and covenants of the parties hereto set forth
in this Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, except as expressly provided in _Section 6.8_, and (a)
may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating
risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate, (b)
have been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, each of which contains certain disclosures that
are not reflected in the text of this Agreement, and (c) may apply standards
of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material
by stockholders of, or other investors in, the Company.

  



  

 **Section 9.4. _Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated
by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and of the
Confidentiality Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and of the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 9.5. _Execution of Agreement; Counterparts; Electronic

same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties; it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

### 

  

### (b) The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, or by a combination of such means, shall constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in
lieu of an original Agreement for all purposes.

 **Section 9.6. _GOVERNING LAW_**. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND WHOLLY PERFORMED WITHIN SUCH STATE,

FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE COMPANY BOARD AND THE INTERNAL CORPORATE AFFAIRS OF
THE COMPANY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA.

  



  

 **Section 9.7. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_**.

may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested in the federal courts, any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and (d) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the

provided for notices in _Section 9.12_. Nothing in this Agreement shall

 **Section 9.9. _Disclosure Schedules_**. All capitalized terms not defined
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, the representations and warranties of each party hereto in
this Agreement are made and given, and the covenants are agreed to, subject
to the disclosures and exceptions set forth in the applicable Disclosure
Schedule. The Disclosure Schedules are arranged for purposes of convenience
in separately titled sections corresponding to the Sections of this
Agreement, and the section numbers contained therein correspond to the
numbered Sections in this Agreement; _provided_ that any information
disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed and incorporated
with respect to all Sections of this Agreement where the relevance of
such disclosure to such Sections is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. The listing of any matter in a Disclosure Schedule shall
expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the disclosing party,
or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be
disclosed under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in
the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of
any Contract or legal requirement shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
In no event shall the listing of any matter in a Disclosure Schedule be
deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the disclosing partys
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement. All
attachments to the Disclosure Schedules are incorporated by reference into
the applicable Disclosure Schedule. The information contained in the
Disclosure Schedules is in all events subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

hereunder may be assigned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,

party without such consent shall be void and of no effect. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.10_, Merger Sub may assign all
of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to another wholly owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of
the Company as long as such assignment would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or delay in any respect the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger; provided that any such assignment
shall not affect the Guarantee or relieve Merger Sub of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the right to
specifically enforce all such obligations under  _Section 9.14_.

shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Company

Offer and the Merger), shall not have expired or been terminated, (B) the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, or (C) any of the following
conditions shall have occurred and continue to exist:

  



  

(1) any Order restraining or enjoining or otherwise materially delaying or
preventing the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all of
the Company Shares or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer shall
have been issued by a Governmental Body or any Law shall have been enacted
that prohibits, restrains or makes illegal the acceptance for payment of, or
the payment for, some or all of the Company Shares;

  



  

(2) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 3.3(a)_ and _3.3(b)_ shall not be true and correct in all
respects (other than failures to be true and correct that are _de minimis_ in
severity, both individually and in the aggregate) at and as of the date of
the Agreement and immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer on the
applicable Expiration Date as if made at and as of such time (other than such
representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of
another specified time, which shall be true and correct as of such time), (B)
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections
_3.2(a)_ ,  _Section 3.5_, _Section 3.20_, or _Section 3.23_, without
giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifications, shall not be true and correct in all material respects at and
as of the date of the Agreement and immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer on the applicable Expiration Date as if made at and as of such time
(other than such representations and warranties that by their terms address
matters only as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct in
all material respects only as of such time) or (C) all of the remaining
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
without giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications shall not be true and correct at and as of the date of
the Agreement and immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer on the
applicable Expiration Date as if made at and as of such time (other than such
representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of
another specified time, which shall be true and correct only as of such time)
except, with respect to this clause (C), where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



        
   

  



  

(3) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or obligations to be performed or complied with

Material Adverse Effect;
