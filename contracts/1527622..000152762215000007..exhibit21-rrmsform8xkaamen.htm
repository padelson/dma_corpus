The Contributing Parties have substantial experience in analyzing and
investing in entities like the Partnership and are capable of evaluating the

Parties are acquiring the Unit Consideration solely for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or state
securities Laws. The Contributing Parties acknowledge that the Unit
Consideration will not be registered under the Securities Act or any
applicable state securities Laws, and that such Unit Consideration may not be
transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom, as
applicable, and pursuant to state securities Laws. The Contributing Parties
acknowledge that any certificate representing the Additional LP Units
comprising the Unit Consideration shall bear a legend in substantially the
following form:

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF ROSE ROCK
MIDSTREAM, L.P. THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED
OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN
APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE

TERMINATE THE EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF ROSE ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P. UNDER

PARTNER OF ROSE ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P., MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON
THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH
RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ROSE
ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P. BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE

 BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF
ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED
TO TRADING.

arising out of or incident to the determination, assessment or collection of
such Taxes ("Tax Losses"), (i) imposed on or incurred by GMH, GMP LLC,
Wattenberg Holding or their respective assets by reason of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign Law
which is attributable to GMH, GMP LLC, Wattenberg Holding or the Contributing
Parties having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group
for the period prior to and including the Closing Date, (ii) any Tax Losses
(other than Tax Losses described in clause (i) above) imposed on or incurred
by or with respect to GMH, GMP LLC, Wattenberg Holding or their respective
assets with respect to the period prior to and including the Closing Date, but
only to the extent such Taxes are attributable to the Subject Interest or
(iii) attributable to a breach by the Contributing Parties of any covenant
with respect to Taxes in this Agreement. The Parties agree that any
indemnification or payment obligation under this Section 7.1(a) of the
Contributing Parties relating to Tax Losses attributable to GMH, GMP LLC,

proportionate share of such Tax Losses equal to the Ownership Percentage.

amount of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by GMH, GMP LLC or Wattenberg

Date which is allocable to the period prior to and including the Closing Date,
the determination shall be made, in the case of property or ad valorem Taxes
or franchise Taxes (which are measured by, or based solely upon capital, debt

other Taxes, by assuming that such pre-Closing Date period constitutes a
separate taxable period applicable to GMH, GMP LLC or Wattenberg Holding and
by taking into account the actual taxable events occurring during such period
(except that exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable

 period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date that are calculated
on an annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned to the period prior to and including the Closing Date ratably
on a per diem basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to GMH, GMP LLC or Wattenberg
Holding shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income,
operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured,
regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is
obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

any Taxes that any of the Contributing Parties is responsible for hereunder,
or if the Contributing Parties or their Affiliates receive a refund of any
Taxes that any of the Partnership Parties is responsible for hereunder, the
party receiving such refund shall, within ninety (90) days after receipt of
such refund, remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes
hereunder. The Parties shall cooperate in order to take all necessary steps to
claim any such refund.

prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit ("Tax Items") required to be included
therein, shall cause such Tax Return to be filed timely with the appropriate
Taxing Authority, and shall be responsible for the timely remittance of
payment (and deposit of any refund) of Taxes due with respect to the period
covered by such Tax Return. The Parties shall bear liability for payment of
Tax to the extent of their ownership percentage in each respective entity
during the period to which the Tax relates.

(b) All Tax Returns filed for any taxable period with respect to the
Transferred Assets shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting
practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question (unless such past
practices are no longer permissible under the applicable Law), and to the
extent any items are not covered by past practices (or in the event such past
practices are no longer permissible under the applicable Law), in accordance
with reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by the filing party with
respect to such Tax Return under this Agreement with the consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the non-filing party.

 7.3 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under this Article VII, shall be treated as increases or decreases to the
Cash Consideration for Tax purposes.

7.4 Transfer Taxes.

The Contributing Parties shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees arising out of or in connection
with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (the "Transfer
Taxes"). Such Transfer Taxes shall be borne 100% by the Contributing Parties.
If required by applicable Law, the Partnership Parties shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

7.5 Survival.

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and obligations of
the Parties with respect to any Tax matter covered by this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall not terminate until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods of
extension and tolling) applicable to such Tax matter.

 7.6 Conflict.

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article VII and any
other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Article VII shall
control.

7.7 Tax Characterization of Transaction.

Immediately prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall borrow approximately
$163,412,000 under the Revolving Credit Agreement to fund the Cash
Consideration (the "Partnership Debt"). The Parties intend that the
Contributing Parties will be treated as receiving a distribution from the
Partnership at Closing: (a) first out of the proceeds of the Partnership Debt
as a "debt-financed transfer" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.707-5(b)(1) to the extent of the Contributing Parties' allocable
share of the indebtedness incurred under the Partnership Debt under Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.707-5(a)(2) and 1.752-3(a)(3); (b) to the extent the
amount distributed to the Contributing Parties exceeds the Contributing
Parties' allocable share of the indebtedness incurred under the Partnership
Debt as described in clause (a), as a reimbursement of the Contributing
Parties' preformation expenditures with respect to the Subject Interest within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d), to the extent
applicable; and (c) to the extent the amount distributed exceeds the amounts
described in clauses (a) and (b), in a transaction subject to treatment under
Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder as in
part a sale, and in part a contribution, of the Subject Interest to the
Partnership to the extent that Treasury Regulations Sections 1.707-4(d) and
1.707-5(b)(1) are inapplicable. Unless otherwise required by a final
determination of the Internal Revenue Service, the Parties agree to act at all
times in a manner consistent with this intended treatment of the Cash
Consideration and the Partnership Debt, including disclosing the distribution
of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the requirements of Section
1.707-3(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION

8.1 Events of Termination.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

(b) by either the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or Contributing
Parties, on the other hand, in writing after the sixtieth (60th) day following
the date hereof, if the Closing has not occurred by such date, provided that
as of such date the terminating Party or its Affiliates are not otherwise in
material default or breach under this Agreement, or have not failed or refused
to close without justification hereunder;

(c) by either the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or the Contributing
Parties, on the other hand, in writing without prejudice to other rights and
remedies which the terminating Party or its Affiliates may have (provided the
terminating Party or its Affiliates are not otherwise

 in material default or breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or refused
to close without justification hereunder), if (i) the other Party has
materially failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained herein
required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) there is one
or more inaccuracies, violations or breaches of the representations or
warranties of the other Party contained herein and such inaccuracies,
violations and breaches would constitute a Material Adverse Effect or a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect, as applicable; provided, however, that in
the case of clause (i) or (ii), the defaulting Party shall have a period of
ten (10) days following written notice from the non-defaulting Party to cure
any breach of this Agreement, if such breach is curable;

(d) by either the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or the Contributing
Parties, on the other hand, in writing, without liability, if there shall be
any non-appealable order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Authority binding on any of the Parties, which prohibits or restrains them
from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that the
Parties shall have used their commercially reasonable efforts to have any such
order, writ, injunction or decree lifted) and the same shall not have been
lifted within thirty (30) days after entry by any such Governmental Authority;

(e) by the Contributing Parties if any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 have become incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived in writing
by the Contributing Parties; or

(f) by the Partnership Parties if any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.1 have become incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived in writing
by the Partnership Parties.

 8.2 Effect of Termination.

If a Party terminates this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1 above, such
termination shall be without liability and none of the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain effective or enforceable, except for those contained in
this Section 8.2 and Article X. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party of any liability for any willful and
material inaccuracy, violation or breach of any representation or warranty of
such Party or any willful and material breach of any covenant or agreement of
such Party under this Agreement or be deemed a waiver of any available remedy
(including specific performance, if available) for any such breach.

ARTICLE IX

9.1 Indemnification of the Partnership Parties.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Contributing
Parties, from and after the Closing Date, shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold the Partnership Parties, their subsidiaries and
their respective securityholders, directors, officers and employees (and the
officers, directors and employees of the General Partner but otherwise
excluding any of the Contributing Parties and their Affiliates) (the
"Partnership Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by any Partnership Indemnified Party as a result
of or arising out of (a) any inaccuracy, violation or breach of a
representation or warranty of the Contributing Parties in this Agreement or
any Contributing Parties Ancillary Document, (b) any breach of any agreement
or covenant on the part of the Contributing Parties made under Section 5.1 or
(c) any breach of any other agreement or covenant on the part of the
Contributing Parties made under this Agreement or any Contributing Parties
Ancillary Document or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

9.2 Indemnification of the Contributing Parties.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date, the Partnership Parties shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and hold the Contributing Parties and their Affiliates and their
respective securityholders, directors, officers and employees (the
"Contributing Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by the Contributing Indemnified Parties as a
result of or arising out of (a) any inaccuracy, violation or breach of a
representation or warranty of the Partnership Parties in this Agreement or any
Partnership Ancillary Document, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant on
the part of the Partnership Parties made under Section 5.1 or (c) any breach
of any other agreement or covenant on the part of the Partnership Parties made
under this Agreement or any Partnership Ancillary Document or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 9.3 Tax Indemnification.

With the exception of any inaccuracy, violation or breach of the
representations and warranties of the Contributing Parties contained in
Sections 3.3(a)(v) and 3.10, nothing in this Article IX shall apply to
liability with respect to Taxes, the liability with respect to which shall be
as set forth in Article VII.

9.4 Survival.

(a) All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
Party hereto or any Knowledge any such Party may have, provided that the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV and in
any certificate delivered in connection herewith with respect to any of those
representations and warranties, and the covenants and agreements made under
Section 5.1, shall terminate and expire at 12:01 a.m., Tulsa, Oklahoma time,
on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, except (i) the
representations and warranties of the Contributing Parties set forth in
Sections 3.3(a)(v) and 3.10 shall survive until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods of
extension and tolling), (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Contributing Parties set forth in Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.2, 3.4 and 3.17
shall survive forever and (iii) the representations and warranties of the
Partnership Parties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6 shall survive
forever. After a representation and warranty or agreement or covenant has
terminated and expired, no indemnification shall or may be sought pursuant to
Section 9.1(a), Section 9.1(b), Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) by any Person
who would have been entitled pursuant to this Article IX to indemnification on
the basis of such representation and warranty or agreement or covenant prior
to its termination and expiration, provided that in the case of each
representation and warranty or covenant or agreement that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this Section 9.4, no claim presented in writing for
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX on the basis of such
representation and warranty or agreement or covenant prior to its termination
and expiration shall be affected in any way by that termination and
expiration. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4, the covenants
and agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms (or, in the
absence of a stated term, in perpetuity).

(b) The indemnification obligations under this Article IX or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall apply regardless of whether any suit or action results solely
or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence or strict
liability of the indemnified party.

9.5 Demands.

(a) Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery
of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, including receipt

 by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such claims for indemnity involving
third party claims being collectively referred to herein as the "Indemnity
Claim"), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to
indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice
thereof in writing to the indemnifying party (a "Claim Notice"), together with
a detailed statement of such information respecting any of the foregoing as it
shall have and all supporting evidence, including any Damages already incurred
and its detailed estimate of any Damages to be incurred in the future. Such
notice shall include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.

(b) If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient time
to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against an Indemnity
Claim and to make a timely response thereto, the indemnifying party's
indemnity obligation relating to such Indemnity Claim shall be limited to the
extent that such failure has actually prejudiced or damaged the indemnifying
party with respect to that Indemnity Claim.

(c) With respect to any claim for indemnification not involving an Indemnity
Claim, the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have agreed to indemnify the
indemnified party pursuant to this Article IX with respect to the claims set
forth in any Claim Notice if and to the extent the indemnifying party does not
provide the indemnified party notice of its disagreement with respect to the
contents of a Claim Notice within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt
thereof.

 9.6 Right to Contest and Defend.

(a) The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to
contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim
for which it is called upon to indemnify by the indemnified party under the
provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice of the intention to so
contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party
within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of
notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any
such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be
conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party
shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings
and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and
expense.

(b) The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action
to be taken with respect thereto; provided, however, that the indemnifying
party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any
obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks
or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive relief. If the
indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto
by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of an
Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which
releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Indemnity
Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party as
reasonably determined by the indemnified party.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party
in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages.

9.7 Cooperation.

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party

 elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the
Person asserting the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
Person, and the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for
any expenses incurred by it in so cooperating without regard to any
limitations set forth in Section 9.10. At no cost or expense to the
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified
party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.

 9.8 Right to Participate.

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons.

9.9 Payment of Damages.

The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, within
ten (10) days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or Damages
are incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating any
amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this
Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds received and
any indemnification reimbursement proceeds received from third parties.

9.10 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) To the extent that the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b), the
Contributing Parties shall not be liable for such Damages until the aggregate
amount of all such Damages exceeds 1.0% of the dollar value of the Aggregate
Consideration as of the Closing Date (the "Threshold Amount"), and then,
subject to the following sentence, the Contributing Parties shall be liable
for all such Damages, whether incurred before or after the Threshold Amount
was exceeded. In no event shall the Contributing Parties' aggregate liability
to the Partnership Indemnified Parties under Section 9.1(a) exceed 15.0% of
the dollar value of the Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing Date (the
"Ceiling Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Threshold Amount
shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a)(v), 3.4 and 3.17
(collectively, the "Contributing Parties Fundamental Representations") and
(ii) the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or
breaches of any of the Contributing Parties Fundamental Representations,
provided the Contributing Parties' aggregate liability for a breach of the
Contributing Parties Fundamental Representations shall not exceed an amount
equal to the dollar value of the Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing
Date.

(b) To the extent the Contributing Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b), the
Partnership Parties shall not be liable for such Damages until the aggregate
amount of all such Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then, subject to
the following sentence, the Contributing Parties shall be liable for all such
Damages, whether incurred before or after the Threshold Amount was exceeded.
In no event shall the Partnership Parties' aggregate liability to the
Contributing Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2(a) exceed the Ceiling
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the

 Threshold Amount shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6
(the "Partnership Fundamental Representations") and (ii) the Ceiling Amount
shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of any of the
Partnership Fundamental Representations, provided the Partnership Parties'
aggregate liability for a breach of the Partnership Fundamental
Representations shall not exceed an amount equal to the dollar value of the
Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing Date.

(c) The Parties agree that any indemnification or payment obligation of the
Contributing Parties under Section 9.1(a) (to the extent relating to any
inaccuracy, violation or breach of a representation or warranty in Sections
3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.4(b) or 3.4(c) or in Sections 3.5 through 3.16) relating to
Damages suffered or incurred by the Partnership Indemnified Parties,
attributable to GMH or Wattenberg Holding or their respective assets,
businesses or operations, shall be limited to Damages actually suffered or
incurred by the Partnership Indemnified Parties.

 9.11 Sole Remedy.

Should the Closing occur, no Party shall have any liability under this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby except as is provided in Article VII or this Article IX
(other than claims or causes of action arising from actual fraud).

ARTICLE X

 10.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
substantive Laws of the State of Delaware without reference to the Delaware
conflicts of law principles. The Parties hereto irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Oklahoma and the federal courts of
the United States of America located in Tulsa County, Oklahoma over any
dispute between the Parties arising out of this Agreement or the transactions

Parties hereto irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute
arising out of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby being
brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance
of such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

10.4 Public Statements.

The Parties shall consult with each other and no Party shall issue any public
announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other Parties, unless the Party
desiring to make such announcement or statement, after seeking such consent
from the other Parties, obtains advice from legal counsel that a public
announcement or statement is required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rules or regulations.

 10.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers.

(a) This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each Party to this Agreement agrees
that no other Party to this Agreement (including through its agents and
representatives) has made any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
to or with such Party relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than those expressly set forth herein and in the
Ancillary Documents.

(b) No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by each Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor
shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

10.6 Conflicting Provisions.

This Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents, read as a whole, set forth
the Parties' rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, and as between them, specific provisions prevail over
general provisions. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, this Agreement shall control.

10.7 Binding Effect; Assignment; Parties in Interest.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, by any Party hereto
without the prior written consent of each other Party. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 10.7, any Party may (without seeking the consent of
the other Parties) transfer or otherwise alienate any of its rights, title,
interest or obligations under this Agreement in connection with (a) a transfer
to an Affiliate which remains an Affiliate, (b) the granting of a pledge,
mortgage, hypothecation, Lien or other security interest, (c) the foreclosure
(judicial or non-judicial) or other settlement or rearrangement pursuant to or
in connection with any transfer made pursuant to (b) above, (d) a transfer in
connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Party, if applicable, or (e) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other
form of statutory reorganization with another Person if such Party is the sole
surviving Person. Except as otherwise provided in Article VII and Article IX
with respect to the Contributing Indemnified Parties and the Partnership
Indemnified Parties, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations
hereunder.

 10.8 Severability.

If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared illegal or
unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation,
by decree of a court of last resort or any other Law, the Partnership Parties
and the Contributing Parties shall promptly meet and negotiate in good faith
substitute provisions for those rendered or declared illegal or unenforceable,
but all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.

10.9 Interpretation.

It is expressly agreed by the Parties that neither this Agreement nor any of
the Ancillary Documents shall be construed against any Party, and no
consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted
this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any provision hereof or thereof or
who supplied the form of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents.
Each Party agrees that this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and
correctly reflects its understanding of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, therefore, waives the application of any Law or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

10.10 Headings and Disclosure Schedules.

(a) The headings of the several Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) The Disclosure Schedules and the Exhibits referred to herein are attached
hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, and unless the context
expressly requires otherwise, the Disclosure Schedules and such Exhibits are
incorporated in the definition of "Agreement."

(c) Any matter disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to any section
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed by such disclosing
Parties for purposes of each other representation and warranty of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on
its face. The listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item in
the Disclosure Schedules shall be adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein if the nature and relevance of such
exception is reasonably apparent on its face from the listing (or inclusion of
a copy) of such document. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

 10.11 Multiple Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

10.12 Action by Partnership Parties.

With respect to any action, notice, consent, approval or waiver that is
required to be taken or given or that may be taken or given by the Partnership
Parties prior to the Closing Date, such action, notice, consent, approval or
waiver shall be taken or given (a) if material, by the Conflicts Committee on
behalf of the Partnership Parties, and (b) if immaterial, by the Partnership
Parties directly..
