WHEREAS, certain officers and employees of the Company have entered into
employment agreements, effective upon consummation of the Merger (the

Agreement; and



WHEREAS, certain shareholders of the Company have entered into non-

the issuance of the certificate of merger not to be made, until after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 5,
notwithstanding the expiration of the 70 day waiting period set forth in such
Section 323 of the Companies Law and/or any filings made and approvals
obtained in connection with the Merger. 



Section 1.3. _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at a time and on a date (the "Closing Date") to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third business day
after satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
Article 5, at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 1881 Page Mill Road,
Palo Alto, California 94304, but in no event before the delivery of the
Shareholder Approval Notices and the expiration of the 70 day period referred
to in Section 1.2, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto.



Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the Companies Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall vest in
the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.



Section 1.5. _Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association_. The
Articles of Association of the Surviving Company shall be amended as necessary
to read the same as the Articles of Association of Acquisition in effect at
the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable law. The
Memorandum of Association of the Company shall be the Memorandum of
Association of the Surviving Company until amended in accordance with
applicable law.



Section 1.6. _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time
shall be appointed as the initial directors of the Surviving Company, each to
hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving
Company until such directors successor is duly elected or appointed and
qualified.



Section 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of Acquisition at the Effective Time
shall be appointed as the initial officers of the Surviving Company, each to
hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving
Company until such officers successor is duly elected or appointed and
qualified.



Section 1.8.  _Conversion of Shares_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each ordinary share, NIS 0.01 par value per share,
of the Company (each a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares
held in the Companys treasury or by any of the Companys Subsidiaries and
(ii) Shares held by  



 

2  Parent, Acquisition or any other subsidiary of Parent) shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $12.00 in cash
without interest (the "Merger Consideration").



(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding ordinary share, NIS 0.01 par value
per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one ordinary share,
NIS 0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Company.



(c) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share held by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
no Merger Consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto.



(d) Each Share subject to repurchase by the Company, or that is otherwise
subject to a risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a
"Restricted Company Share") shall be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.8(a) into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to permanent retention
(i.e., forfeiture by the holder thereof) by Parent on the same terms as
governed such Restricted Company Share prior to the Merger (such Merger
Consideration, until the restrictions thereon lapse, is referred to as
"Restricted Cash"); _provided, however,_ that upon permanent retention of any
Restricted Cash, Parent will pay to the former holder of the applicable
Restricted Company Share an amount equal to the repurchase price of the
Restricted Company Shares in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
if any. Parent will distribute to former holders of Restricted Company Shares
any amount of Restricted Cash with respect to which the restrictions lapse
after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms that governed the
Restricted Company Share. 



Section 1.9. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time Parent shall deliver to its transfer
agent, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected
by Parent and Acquisition and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in
accordance with this Article 1 an amount of cash equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding as of the
Effective Time, other than the Shares referred to in Section 1.8(c) (such cash
is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be exchanged for
outstanding Shares.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") and
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and  



 

3  the Company may reasonably specify prior to Closing) and (ii) customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence sufficient to show that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.9, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 1.9.



(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as may
be required pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a
suitable bond or indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate.



(d) Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.



(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former shareholders of the Company upon the one year anniversary the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration.



(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
so directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon the termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 1.9(e).



(g) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



Section 1.10. _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_ _._



(a) At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Sub-Plan
Options, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each "Company Stock  



 

4  Option" and, collectively, "Company Stock Options") issued pursuant to the
Companys Amended and Restated Verisity Ltd. 2000 U.S. Share Incentive Plan,
Verisity Ltd. 1999 Israeli Share Option Plan, Verisity Ltd. 1999 Share
Incentive Plan, the Verisity Ltd. 1997 Israel Share and Stock Option Incentive
Plan (but not including the Sub-Plan for the Issuance of Options to the
Companys Employees), 1996 U.S. Stock Option Plan (as amended on October 28,
1999), Verisity Ltd. 2000 Israeli Share Option Plan and Amended and Restated
Axis Systems Inc. 1997 Stock Plan or other agreement or arrangement, whether
vested or unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section
1.10. All plans or agreements described above pursuant to which any Company
Stock Option has been issued or may be issued are referred to collectively as
the "Company Plans". Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to any changes
made in accordance with Section 4.22, each outstanding Company Stock Option
outstanding under the Sub-Plan for the Issuance of Options to the Companys
Employees under the Verisity Ltd. 1997 Israel Share and Stock Option Incentive
Plan (the "Sub-Plan" and such Company Stock Options, the "Sub-Plan Options")
shall not be converted into options to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock, but shall be exercisable for the consideration specified in Sub-Plan
and the Tamir Fishman Trust. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Plan under
which such option was granted and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to
vesting, except that: (i) such option will be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of common stock of Parent, par value $.01 per share (the "Parent
Common Stock"), equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise
price of each such Company Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing (A) the
per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent. The terms of each Company Stock
Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment
as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or
other similar transaction with respect to Parent Common Stock on or subsequent
to the Effective Time. The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the quotient of
(1) $12.00, divided by (2) the average of the closing prices on the NYSE of a
share of Parent Common Stock during the five (5) trading days ending on the
date that is two trading days prior to the Closing Date. The parties
acknowledge that, with respect to any option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code
("incentive stock options" or "ISOs"), the foregoing provisions comply with
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.



(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit for Shares
(each "Company Restricted Stock Unit" and, collectively "Company Restricted
Stock Units") issued pursuant to any Company Plan, whether vested or unvested,
shall be converted as of the Effective Time into restricted stock units for
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.10. At the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit assumed by Parent pursuant
to this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions set forth in the Company Plan under which such
Company Restricted Stock Unit was issued and the  



 

5  agreement evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including provisions with respect to vesting, except that upon vesting
the Company Restricted Stock Unit shall result in that number of shares of
Parent Company Stock equal to the product of the number of Shares that
remained issuable upon vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. The terms of
each Company Restricted Stock Unit shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to
Parent Common Stock on or after the Effective Time.



(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
Company Plans and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such options
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 1.10 after giving effect to the Merger).



(d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units assumed
in accordance with this Section 1.10. No later than five business days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to any Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock
Units held by persons who are directors, officers or employees of, or
consultants to, the Company or any Subsidiary and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options or
restricted stock units remain outstanding.



(e) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be
effected any necessary amendments to the Company Plans to give effect to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10.



ARTICLE 2



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition,
subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Letter delivered by the
Company to Parent in accordance with Section 4.12 (the "Disclosure Letter")
and certified by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company (which exceptions shall specifically identify the Section,
subsection or paragraph, as applicable, to which such exception relates,
and shall be deemed to relate to each other Section, subsection or paragraph
to which such exceptions clearly relate on their face), that:



 

6 Section 2.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries; Investments_.



(a) Section 2.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date
of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the persons of which the
Company owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting interests or otherwise
has the right to direct the management (each, a "Subsidiary") together with
the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and the
percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or other equity
interests owned directly or indirectly by the Company. All the outstanding
capital stock or other ownership interests of each Subsidiary is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien or any other
limitation or restriction. Each of the Company and Subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and (to the extent such concept exists under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization) in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and
has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The
Company has delivered to Parents counsel accurate and complete copies of the
Articles of Association or Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or
comparable governing documents, each as in full force and effect on the date
hereof, of the Company and each Subsidiary. The Companys Amended and Restated
Articles of Association, as amended and restated on June 4, 2002, and filed
with the SEC as Exhibit 3.3 to the Companys Form 10-K on March 12, 2004,
were adopted and approved by more than 50% of the voting rights present at the
meeting and voting on the resolution, as required by the then current Articles
of Association of the Company. Other than as specified in Section 2.1(a) of
the Disclosure Letter, the Company has no operating Subsidiaries other than
those incorporated in a state of the United States.



(b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and, to the extent such concept exists under applicable law, in good standing
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. For purposes hereof, the term "Material Adverse Effect on
the Company" means (i) any circumstance involving, change in or effect on the
Company or any Subsidiary that is, or is reasonably likely in the future to
be, materially adverse to the assets, liabilities (including contingent
liabilities), business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding from the foregoing the
effect, if any, of (A) changes in general economic conditions, (B) any action
or inaction required of the Company under Section 4.1, (C) changes in the
securities markets in general, (D) changes generally affecting the industry in
which the Company and Subsidiaries operate (provided that such changes do not
affect the Company and Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate
manner), (E) the effect of the public announcement or pendency of the
transactions contemplated hereby on the bookings, orders or purchases by,
provision of materials by, or other actions of, existing or
prospective customers or suppliers of the Company or any Subsidiary, (F) any
shareholder class action litigation arising directly out of allegations of a
breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement, or (G) any change in the
price or trading volume of the Shares from the date hereof, in and of itself;
 



 

7  or (ii) any circumstance involving, change in or effect on the Company or
any Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to prevent the Company from
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that any reference to dollar amounts in this Agreement shall not be
deemed, in and of itself, to constitute the point at which a change or event
is sufficiently material to be "material" or "materially adverse". __



(c) _Other Interests_. Section 2.1(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and complete list of each equity investment made by the Company or any
Subsidiary in any person (including the percentage ownership, purchase price
and any management or directorship rights granted to the Company or any such
Subsidiary) other than the Subsidiaries ("Other Interests"). The Other
Interests are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of
all Liens.



Section 2.2. _Capitalization of the Company and Subsidiaries_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000,000 NIS,
divided into (i) 91,222,534 Shares, of which, as of December 31, 2004,
24,027,344 were issued and outstanding; (ii) 3,777,466 Class B Ordinary Shares
of NIS 0.01 par value each, none of which are outstanding; and (iii)
5,000,000 Special Preferred Shares of NIS 0.01 par value each, none of which
are outstanding. The Company does not have outstanding any preferred stock
purchase rights issuable pursuant to a rights agreement. All of
the outstanding Shares are, and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Company Stock Options, when issued in accordance with the Company Plans, will
be, validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. As of December 31, 2004, an aggregate of 1,287,655 Shares were
available for grant and 3,844,812 Shares were issuable upon or otherwise
deliverable in connection with the exercise of outstanding Company Stock
Options granted pursuant to the Company Plans. As of December 31, 2004, an
aggregate of 404,033 Shares were available for issuance pursuant to the
Company ESPP. Between December 14, 2004 and the date hereof, no shares of the
Companys capital stock have been issued other than pursuant to Company Stock
Options already in existence on such date. Except as set forth above, as of
December 31, 2004, there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company, (ii) no securities of the Company or
any Subsidiary convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares
of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii)
no options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
Subsidiary, and no obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to issue, any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary, and (iv) no equity equivalent interests in the
ownership or earnings of the Company or any Subsidiary or other similar
rights. All of the outstanding Shares, Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units (collectively, the "Company Securities") were issued
in compliance with the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), applicable U.S. state securities laws, the Israeli
Companies Ordinance [New Version] 1983, the Companies Law and the Israeli
Securities Law, 5728-1968. As of December 31, 2004, except with respect to
the Restricted Company Shares, there are no outstanding rights or obligations
of the Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of its outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests. There are
no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other arrangements or  



 

8  understandings to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which
it or the Company Board is bound, and to its knowledge, as of the date
hereof, there are no other agreements, voting trusts or other arrangements or
understandings, relating to the voting or registration of any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or any Subsidiary. No
Company Securities are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary. Section 2.2 of
the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list, as of December 31,
2004, of all holders of outstanding Restricted Company Shares, Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, the exercise or vesting schedule,
the exercise price per share, and the term of each such Share, Company Stock
Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable and in the case of
Company Stock Options, whether such option is a nonqualified stock option or
incentive stock option, and any restrictions on exercise or sale of the option
or underlying Shares, and whether or not, to the Companys knowledge, an
election under Section 83(b) of the Code is in effect with respect to
any Shares that are Restricted Company Shares, in each case as of the date
hereof. Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies ( _provided_ that a holder
may have altered the Tax treatment of the Shares issued on exercise of an ISO
by making a disqualifying disposition). Except as set forth in Section 2.2 of
the Disclosure Letter, none of the terms of the Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Company Shares provides for accelerated
vesting as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other events). Other than as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports, the Company has not granted Company Stock Options to employees or
consultants under any Company Plan at an exercise price of less than the fair
market value per Share at the time of grant as determined in good faith by
the Company Board.



(b) The Shares constitute the only class of equity securities of the Company
or any Subsidiary registered or required to be registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").



Section 2.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Recommendation_. 



(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except
the approval of the Merger and the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the shareholders of the Company as specified in Section 2.3(b) below. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company Board, at a meeting
duly called and held, has adopted resolutions by the unanimous vote of the
non-employee directors (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions to be entered into by the Company, as
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) exempting the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from the "interested shareholder" provisions of
the Companys Articles of Association, (iii) concluding, after



 

9  taking into account the financial condition of the merging companies, that
in its opinion there is no reasonable suspicion that the Surviving Company
will not be able to pay its debts to its creditors, (iv) declaring that it is
in the best interests of the Company (including its shareholders) that the
Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (v) directing that the adoption of this
Agreement be submitted as promptly as practicable to a vote at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, and (vi) recommending that the shareholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, which resolutions have
not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
Parent and Acquisition, a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or to
general principles of equity.



(b) Assuming neither Parent nor Acquisition, nor any of their affiliates (as
specified in Section 320(c) of the Companies Law), (i) owns or holds
any Shares, or (ii) votes any Shares it owns, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the Shares present and voting at the Company
Shareholder Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any securities of the
Company necessary to approve the Merger. The quorum required for the Company
Shareholder Meeting is at least two shareholders who hold or represent at
least a majority of the voting rights of the issued share capital of the
Company. No vote or approval of (i) any creditor of the Company or any
Subsidiary (subject to the rights of creditors under Section 319 of the
Companies Law), (ii) any holder of any option or warrant granted by the
Company or any Subsidiary, or (iii) any shareholder of the
Companys Subsidiaries is necessary in order to approve or permit the
consummation of the Merger.



Section 2.4. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has filed all required forms, reports and documents ("Company
SEC Reports") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in
connection with and since its initial public offering in March 2001, and each
of such Company SEC Reports complied at the time of filing in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and
documents were filed. None of such Company SEC Reports, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in
light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except
to the extent superseded by a Company SEC Report filed subsequently and prior
to the date hereof. The statements of operations included in the financial
statements of the Company contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "Financial
Statements") do not reflect items of special or nonrecurring revenue in
excess of $200,000 in the aggregate or other income not earned in the ordinary
course of business in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate, except as expressly
specified therein, and such Financial Statements include all adjustments,
which consist only of  



 

10  normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation. The Financial
Statements have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP")
consistently applied and maintained throughout the periods indicated and
fairly present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and
Subsidiaries at their respective dates and the results of their operations
and changes in financial position for the periods covered thereby (subject to
normal year-end adjustments and except that unaudited financial statements do
not contain all required footnotes). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.



(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Acquisition or Parent a
complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications that, as of the
date hereof, are required to be filed with the SEC but have not yet been
filed with the SEC to agreements, documents or other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC under Item 601(b) of
Regulation S-K, and all such amendments or modifications will be timely filed
with the SEC. 



(c) None of the Subsidiaries is, or has at any time been, subject to the
reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.



Section 2.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
proxy statement relating to the meeting of the Companys shareholders to be
held in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") will, at the date
mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the meeting of
shareholders of the Company to be held in connection with the Merger (the
"Company Shareholders Meeting"), contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they are made not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation, warranty or covenant with
respect to any information supplied or required to be supplied by Parent or
Acquisition which is contained in or omitted from any of the foregoing
documents.



Section 2.6. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for
such filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be
required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, state securities or blue sky laws, and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), any filings under
similar merger notification laws or regulations of non-Israeli or U.S.
Governmental Entities, to the extent required by applicable law, the consent
of the Israeli Commissioner of Restrictive Trade Practices, to the extent
required pursuant to the Restrictive Trade Practices Law (1988) as amended,
the filing and recordation of the Merger Proposal and the Shareholder Approval
Notice and other filings as required by the Companies Law, the approval of
the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Israeli Ministry of Industry and
Commerce (the "OCS") and the approval of the Israeli Investment Center in the
Israeli Ministry of Industry and Commerce (the "Investment Center"), no other
filing with or notice to and no other permit, authorization, consent or  



 

11  approval of any Israeli, United States (federal, state or local) or foreign
court or tribunal, or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency
or authority (each a "Governmental Entity") is necessary for the execution

Section 2.11. _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters_.



(a) Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter lists as of the date hereof all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and all bonus, stock

retirement, health, life, or disability insurance, dependent care, severance
and other similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
and any current or former employment or executive compensation or severance
agreements, written or otherwise, maintained, contributed to or required to be
maintained or contributed to for the benefit of or relating to any employee or
former employee of the Company, any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that is a member of a controlled group including the Company or
that is under common control with the Company within the meaning of Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), as well as each plan with respect to
which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section
4069 (if such plan has been or were terminated) or Section 4212(c) of ERISA
(together, the "Employee Plans"). The Company has made available to Parent
a copy of (i) the two (2) most recent annual reports on Form 5500 filed with
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") for each disclosed Employee Plan
where such report is required; (ii) the documents and instruments governing

Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability (contingent or
otherwise) with respect to any such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan  



 

15  has been maintained in all material respects, by its terms and in operation,
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable law, and there has
been no material violation of any reporting or disclosure requirement imposed
by ERISA or the Code. Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust intended to be exempt under Section
501(a) of the Code, has been determined to be so qualified or exempt by the
IRS, and since the date of each most recent determination, there has been no
event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualified status. No Employee
Plan has participated in, engaged in or been a party to any transaction that
is prohibited under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and not
exempt under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA, respectively.
With respect to any Employee Plan, (i) neither the Company, nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has had asserted against it any claim for taxes under Chapter
43 of Subtitle D of the Code and Section 5000 of the Code, or for penalties
under ERISA Section 502(c), (i) or (l), nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
is there a basis for any such claim, and (ii) no officer, director or employee
of the Company has committed a material breach of any fiduciary responsibility
or obligation imposed by Title I of ERISA. Other than routine claims for
benefits, there is no claim or proceeding (including any audit or
investigation) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
involving any Employee Plan by any person, or by the IRS, the United States
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity against such Employee
Plan or the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.



(b) Section 2.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list as of the date
hereof of all (i) employment agreements with officers of the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate, (ii) agreements with consultants who are individuals

policies of the Company with or relating to its employees, except such
programs and policies required to be maintained by applicable law, and (iv)
plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate with or relating to its employees that contain change in control
provisions whether or not listed in other parts of the Disclosure Letter. The
Company has made available to Parent copies of all such agreements, plans,
programs and other arrangements.



(c) There will be no payment, accrual of additional benefits, acceleration
of payments or vesting of any benefit under any Employee Plan or any other
agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a
party, and no employee, officer or director of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate will become entitled to severance, termination allowance or similar
payments, solely by reason of entering into or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with each other).



(d) No Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits to former employees of the Company
or its ERISA Affiliates other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state laws. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and
Sections 4980B, 9801, 9802, 9811 and 9812 of the Code.



 

16 (e) There are no controversies relating to any Employee Plan or other labor
matters pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate and any of its employees. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining
agreement, collective labor agreement or other contract or arrangement with a
labor union, trade union or other organization applicable to persons employed
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate nor does the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees, or is otherwise required (under any legal
requirement, contract or otherwise) to provide benefits or working conditions
beyond the minimum benefits and working conditions required by applicable law
to be provided pursuant to rules and regulations of any jurisdiction in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries have employees, including the Histadrut
(General Federation of Labor), the Coordination Bureau of Economic
Organization and the Industrialists Association, and the Company has not
been officially apprised that any petition has been filed or proceeding
instituted by an employee or group of employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary, with any Governmental Entity seeking recognition of a bargaining
representative. Except as set forth in Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has or is subject to, and no employee

termination of employment. All of the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are "at will" employees subject to the termination notice
provisions included in employment agreements or applicable law. No strikes,
work stoppage, material grievance, material claim of unfair labor practice, or
dispute against the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has occurred, is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, threatened, and
to the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates there is no basis for
any of the foregoing. To the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, none of their employees is a member of any labor union, there is
no organizational activity being made or threatened by or on behalf of any
labor union with respect to any employees of the Company or any ERISA

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates sponsors or has ever
sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an obligation to contribute
or incurred a liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any

"Multiemployer Plan" means a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37)
and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and "Multiple Employer Plan" means any Employee
Benefit Plan sponsored by more than one employer, within the meaning of
Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code.

employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or a Foreign Plan
can be amended or terminated at any time, without consent from any other party
and without liability other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such
amendment or termination (other than charges incurred as a result of such
termination). The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have made full and timely
payment of all amounts required to be contributed or paid as expenses or
accrued such payments in accordance with normal procedures under the terms of
each Employee Plan and applicable law, and the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates shall continue to do so through the Closing.

the Company or any Subsidiary has given written notice terminating his or her
employment with the Company or any Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company

of the 2001 plan year, either adopted or certified in writing its intent to
adopt the required GUST amendments to each such MandP Plan, and the Company
hereby represents and warrants that an application for a GUST opinion letter
for each such MandP Plan was filed with the IRS by the MandP Plan sponsor on or
before December 31, 2000. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate shall also
adopt the GUST-approved MandP Plan by the deadline specified in IRS
Announcement 2001-104. For purposes hereof, "GUST" means the statutes

designed tax-qualified retirement plans sponsored or maintained by the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate, the Company and each such ERISA Affiliate has adopted
the required GUST amendments and submitted the plan to the IRS on or before
February 28, 2002 for a favorable determination letter as to its tax qualified

Foreign Plan nor any pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in
the normal operation of the Foreign Plans), suits or proceedings against any
Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign

Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise result in any
material liability with respect to any Foreign Plan. Without derogating from
the above, the Companys or any Subsidiarys obligations to provide severance
pay to its employees are fully funded or have been properly provided for in
the Financial Statements attached to the Company SEC Reports in accordance
with US GAAP. All other liabilities of the Company relating to its employees

Subsidiary is in any material respect in violation of any term of any
employment contract, non-disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or

affiliated group the common parent of which is the Company. No Subsidiary that
is a "United States person" (as such term is used in Section 1291(a) of the
Code) has at any time owned a material (determined with reference to the
Company) interest in a passive foreign investment company within the meaning
of Section 1297 of the Code. No Subsidiary that was or is a
"controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in the Code) (determined solely
with reference to ownership of such Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, by
other Subsidiaries that are "United States persons" as defined in Section
957(c) of the Code) has had an investment in "United States property" within
the meaning of Section 956(c) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is or has been a party to a "reportable transaction," as such term
is defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.6011-4(b)(1)(other than such
transactions that have been properly reported or are not yet required to have
been reported), or to a transaction that is or is substantially similar to a
"listed transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation §
1.6011-4(b)(2), or any other transaction requiring disclosure under provisions
of state, local or foreign Tax law that address transactions that may be tax
avoidance transactions.

each material tax incentive granted to the Company and any Subsidiary under
the laws of the State of Israel, the period for which such tax incentive
applies, and the nature of such tax incentive. The Company and Subsidiaries
have complied with all material requirements of Israeli law to be entitled to
claim all such incentives. Subject to the receipt of the approvals set forth
in Section 2.6 of the Disclosure Letter and compliance by the Surviving
Company with the applicable requirements and conditions, the consummation of
the Merger will not adversely affect the remaining duration of the incentive
or require any recapture of any previously claimed incentive, and no consent
or approval of any Governmental Entity is required, other than as
contemplated by Section 2.6, prior to or after the consummation of the Merger
in order to preserve the entitlement of the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries to any such incentive.



Section 2.14. _Intellectual Property_ _._



(a) _Certain Definitions_. As used herein, the term "Intellectual Property"
means all intellectual property rights arising from or associated with the
following, whether protected, created or arising under the laws of the United
States or any other jurisdiction: (i) trade names, trademarks and service
marks (registered and unregistered), domain names and other Internet
addresses or identifiers, trade dress and similar rights and applications
(including intent to use applications) to register any of the foregoing
(collectively, "Marks"); (ii) patents and patent applications (collectively,
"Patents"); (iii) copyrights and registrations and applications therefor
(collectively, "Copyrights"); (iv) non-public know-how, inventions,
discoveries, improvements, concepts, ideas, methods, processes, designs,
schematics, drawings, formulae, technical data, specifications, research and
development information, technology, data bases and other technical

from not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value
from its disclosure or use, but excluding any Copyrights or Patents that may
cover or protect any of the foregoing (collectively, "Trade Secrets"); (v)
mask work and similar rights protecting integrated circuit or chip
topographies or designs (collectively, "Mask Works"); and (vi) moral rights,
publicity rights and any other proprietary, intellectual or industrial
property rights of any kind or nature that do not comprise or are not

purposes hereof, "Software" means any and all (1) computer programs, including
any and all software implementations of algorithms, models and methodologies,
whether in source code or object code, (2) databases and compilations,
including any and all data and collections of data, whether machine readable
or otherwise, and (3) all documentation, including user manuals and training
materials, relating to any of the foregoing.



(b) _Registered IP_. Section 2.14(b)(1) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth an
accurate and complete list of all registered Marks, other than those Marks
that the Company and its Subsidiaries have not actively used in the
ordinary course of business since February 9, 2004 (collectively, the "Dusty
Marks"), owned (in whole or in part) by the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively "Company Registered  



 

22  Marks"), Section 2.14(b)(2) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of all Patents owned (in whole or in part) by,
or exclusively licensed to, the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively the
"Company Patents") and Section 2.14(b)(3) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth
an accurate and complete list of all registered Copyrights owned (in whole or

whole or in part) by the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively the "Company
Registered Copyrights" and, together with the Company Registered Marks and
the Company Patents, the "Company Registered IP"). No Company Registered IP
has been or is currently involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such action is or has been threatened with
respect to any of the Company Registered IP. All Company Registered IP has
been registered or obtained in accordance with applicable legal requirements,
is currently in full force and effect except for the Dusty Marks and the
Company Registered IP identified in Section 2.14(b)(4) of the Disclosure
Letter that the Company or any Subsidiary decided in its reasonable business
judgment to abandon, not to enforce or to allow to lapse (provided that no
representation and warranty is made regarding the effectiveness of any patent
applications), and, except as set forth in Section 2.14(b)(4) of the
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any
notice or claim challenging the validity or enforceability or alleging the
misuse of any of the Company Registered IP, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, questioning the validity or enforceability of any of the Company
Registered IP. Except for the Dusty Marks and the Company Registered IP
identified in Section 2.14(b)(4) of the Disclosure Letter that the Company or
any Subsidiary has decided in its reasonable business judgment to abandon,
not to enforce, or to allow to lapse, (a) the Company has timely paid all
filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees and
annuities required with respect to any of the Company Registered IP, and (b)
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action or failed to take
any action, which action or failure reasonably could be expected to result in
the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of any Company Registered IP.



(c) _Actions to Protect Intellectual Property_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable steps to (i) protect its rights
in (A) Intellectual Property that is owned by, and material to the ongoing
business operations of, the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) the Company
Software and (ii) maintain the confidentiality of all information that
constitutes or at any time constituted a Trade Secret of the Company or its
Subsidiaries other than that information for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries decided, in their reasonable business judgment, not to seek, or
continue to seek, protection as a Trade Secret. Section 2.14(c) of the
Disclosure Letter lists all Company Software and material Intellectual
Property contributed to industry standards setting bodies. Without limiting
the foregoing, all current and former employees, consultants and contractors
of the Company or any Subsidiary have executed and delivered proprietary
information, confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the
Companys standard forms (which have previously been provided to Parent).



 

23 (d) _Ownership_. Except as set forth in Section 2.14(d) of the Disclosure
Letter and except for Intellectual Property licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary, the Company and each Subsidiary owns exclusively all right, title
and interest in and to all of the Intellectual Property that is used by the
Company or any Subsidiary and that is not licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary, as applicable, in its business as currently conducted, free and
clear of any and all Liens. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any notice or claim (whether written, oral or otherwise) challenging
the Companys or any Subsidiarys ownership of any of the Intellectual
Property owned (in whole or in part) by the Company or any Subsidiary or
suggesting that any other person has any claim of legal or beneficial
ownership with respect thereto, nor to the knowledge of the Company is there
a reasonable basis for any claim that the Company or any Subsidiary does not
so own any of such Intellectual Property; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing only applies to actual third party claims of ownership to the
Intellectual Property of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and does not apply
to any claim of infringement, misappropriation, enforceability or validity of
the Intellectual Property of the Company or a Subsidiary.



(e) _License Agreements_. Section 2.14(e)(1) of the Disclosure Letter sets
forth a complete and accurate list (indicating for each the title and the
parties thereto) of all agreements currently in effect that contain any grant
to the Company or any Subsidiary from any third party of any material right
under or with respect to any Intellectual Property, other than desktop or work
station software applications generally available on standard terms and for
which the annual license fee payable by the Company or any Subsidiary under
the applicable license agreement is no more than $50,000 (collectively, the
"Inbound License Agreements"). Subject to the Company securing the necessary
consents from third parties listed in Schedule 5.3(e), the rights licensed
under each Inbound License Agreement shall be exercisable by the Surviving
Company in all material respects on and after the Closing to the same extent
as by the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing. No loss or
expiration of any material Intellectual Property licensed to the Company or
any Subsidiary under any Inbound License Agreement is pending or reasonably
foreseeable or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Except as set
forth in Section 2.14(e)(2) of the Disclosure Letter, no licensor under any
Inbound License Agreement has any ownership or exclusive license rights in or
with respect to any improvements made solely by the Company or any Subsidiary
to the Intellectual Property licensed thereunder. Section 2.14(e)(3) of the
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of all license
agreements under which the Company or any Subsidiary has granted any licenses
of any Software or any rights under any material Intellectual Property
to another person, excluding non-exclusive internal use licenses granted by
the Company or any Subsidiary to end user customers in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, indicating for each the title and the
parties thereto. Except as set forth in Section 2.14(e)(4) of the Disclosure
Letter, each person to which the Company or any Subsidiary has distributed or
licensed any Company Software has executed and delivered to the Company a
written license agreement (including "shrink wrap" and "click through"
license agreements), a representative copy of which has been provided by the
Company to Parents counsel prior to the date hereof.



(f) _Sufficiency of IP Assets_. The Intellectual Property owned by,
or licensed under the Inbound License Agreements to, the Company or any
Subsidiary constitutes all the material Intellectual Property rights necessary
for the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses as they are
currently conducted.



 

24 (g) _Transfers; Loss of Rights_. Except as set forth in Section 2.14(g) of the
Disclosure Letter, the Company has not transferred ownership of, or granted
any exclusive license with respect to, any material Intellectual Property.
Upon the Closing and subject to the Company securing the necessary consents
from third parties listed in Section 2.14(g) of the Disclosure Letter, Parent
shall succeed to all of the material Intellectual Property rights necessary
for the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses as they are
currently conducted and all of such rights shall be exercisable by Parent to
the same extent as by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.
No loss or expiration of any of the material Intellectual Property used by the
Company in the conduct of its business (other than the Company Registered
Intellectual Property and the Intellectual Property subject to an Inbound
License Agreement referenced in Sections 2.14(g) and (e), respectively) has
been threatened in writing or is known to be pending.



(h) _No Infringement by the Company or Third Parties_. None of the products
(including Software), services, or other technology or materials, used,
licensed, sold, or otherwise distributed by or for the Company or any
Subsidiary, nor any other activities or operations of the Company or any
Subsidiary, infringes upon, misappropriates, violates, or constitutes the
unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property of any third party, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice or claim asserting or
suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, violation, or
unauthorized use is occurring or has or may have occurred, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, is there any reasonable basis therefor.



(i) _No Violations_. No Intellectual Property owned by or, to the knowledge of
the Company, licensed to the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree, or stipulation that materially restricts
the continued use thereof by the Company or such Subsidiary in its business as
presently conducted or, in the case of any Intellectual Property licensed to
others, that materially restricts the sale, transfer, assignment or licensing
thereof by the Company to any person. To the knowledge of the Company, no
third party is misappropriating, infringing or violating any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary in any respect material to the Company and its Subsidiaries.



(j) _Software_. Except for (i) the Software licensed to the Company or one of
its subsidiaries under the Inbound License Agreements, (ii) desktop or work
station software applications generally available on standard terms and that
are licensed to the Company or any Subsidiary for an aggregate license fee of
no more than $50,000 each, and (iii) any "open source" Software disclosed
on Section 2.14(k) of the Disclosure Letter and any "open source" Software
that is used internally by the Company or any Subsidiary and is not
incorporated in or distributed with any Company Software, in whole or in part,
all of the Software products distributed by the Company and all designs,
design flows and design languages related thereto and all other Software
developed by or for the Company or any Subsidiary and all designs, design
flows and design languages related thereto (collectively, "Company Software")

their employment, (B) developed by independent contractors who have
expressly assigned their rights to the Company or a Subsidiary pursuant to
written agreements or (C) otherwise acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary
from a third party pursuant to a written agreement in which the ownership
rights therein were expressly assigned to the Company. Except as disclosed in
Section 2.14(j) of the Disclosure Letter, no source code of any Company
Software has been licensed or otherwise provided to another person other than
an escrow agent pursuant to the terms of a source code escrow agreement in a
form customary for the relevant industry and, subject to Section 2.14(c), all
such source code has been safeguarded and protected as Trade Secrets of the
Company or a Subsidiary.



(k) _Open Source_. Except as disclosed in Section 2.14(k) of the Disclosure
Letter, none of the Companys Software, in whole or in part, incorporates or
is distributed with any "open source" Software, including any Software that is
licensed under the Artistic License, the Mozilla Public License, the GPL or
LGPL, that (i) conditions the use or the distribution of Company Software on
the disclosure, licensing or distribution of the source code of such Company
Software or (ii) otherwise materially limits the Companys or
any Subsidiarys freedom of action with regard to seeking compensation in
connection with sublicensing or distributing the object code of such licensed
software. Each of the Company and Subsidiaries has operated its business in
compliance with all material terms of the license agreements applicable to
any "freeware" or "shareware" that the Company or any Subsidiary has used in
its business. None of the Company Software, as a result of intermingling or
integration by the Company or its Subsidiaries of proprietary code contained
in the Company Software with any such "open source" Software is, in whole or
in part, subject to the provisions of any open source license agreement.



(l) _Performance of Existing Software Products_. Each of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries existing or currently manufactured Software products
performs, in all material respects, the functions described in any published
specifications or end user documentation or other information provided
to customers of the Company or such Subsidiary acquiring such products.



(m) _Restrictions on Employees_. To the knowledge of the Company and except as
set forth in Section 2.14(m) of the Disclosure Letter, no employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated under
any agreement, or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative agency, or any other legal restriction, that materially
interferes with such employee or contractor carrying out his or her duties for
the Company or such Subsidiary or that conflicts with the Companys business
as presently conducted and proposed to be conducted. Except as set forth in
Section 2.14(m) of the Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of the Company, it
is not utilizing, nor will it be necessary to utilize, any inventions of any
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (or persons the Company or any
Subsidiary currently intends to hire) made, or any confidential information
(including Trade Secrets) of another person to which such employees were
exposed, prior to their employment by the Company or any Subsidiary.



 

26 (n) _Export_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has exported or
transmitted Software or other materials in connection with the Companys or
Subsidiaries business to any country to which such export or transmission is
restricted by any applicable law, without first having obtained all necessary
and appropriate United States and foreign government licenses or permits.

delivered to Parents counsel. All such current leases and subleases are in
full force and effect, are valid and effective in accordance with their
respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing material default or event of default (or event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) by the Company or any

complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of all insurance contracts

PARENT AND ACQUISITION



Parent and Acquisition hereby represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:



Section 3.1. _Organization_.



(a) Parent is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Acquisition is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Israel. Each of Parent and Acquisition
has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted. Parent has
heretofore delivered to the Companys counsel accurate and complete copies of
the Articles of Association, as currently in full force and effect, of
Acquisition.



(b) Parent is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing (to the extent
such concept exists under the laws of applicable jurisdiction) to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. For purposes hereof,
the term "Material Adverse Effect on Parent" means any circumstance involving,
change in or effect on Parent or any of its subsidiaries that would reasonably
be expected to prevent Parent from consummating the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



Section 3.2.  _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and
Acquisition and, prior to the Closing Date, will be duly and validly
authorized by Parent as the sole shareholder of Acquisition. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Acquisitions Board of Directors, at a
meeting duly called and held, has unanimously adopted resolutions
(i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions to be entered into by Acquisition, as contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) concluding, after taking into account the financial
condition of the merging companies, that in its opinion, there is no
reasonable suspicion that the Surviving Company will not be able to pay its
debts to its creditors. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Acquisition and constitutes, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, a valid, legal
and binding agreement of each of Parent and Acquisition enforceable against
each of Parent and Acquisition in accordance with its terms, subject to any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or to
general principles of equity.



 

32 Section 3.3. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion or incorporation by reference

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in
light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation, warranty or
covenant with respect to any information supplied or required to be supplied
by the Company which is contained in or omitted from any of the foregoing

Acquisition of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent or Acquisition of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure to obtain such
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such filings or give
such notice would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition nor the consummation by Parent or
Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or
result in any breach of any provision of the respective Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Parent or
Acquisition; (ii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any

Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, the financial advisor to Parent) is
entitled to any brokerage finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements

of the Company and Acquisition will give all notices, make all publications
and file all filings required under the Companies Law and the Companies
Regulation (Merger) 5670-2000 in order to effectuate the Merger.



(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary in accordance with

Association to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the SEC has cleared the
Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The shareholder vote
required for the adoption and approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be the vote required by the Companies Law and the
Companys Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association. The Company
will, through the Company Board (subject to Section 4.4), recommend to holders
of Shares that they approve such matters. The Company and Parent shall
promptly prepare  



 

38  and the Company shall promptly file with the SEC the Proxy Statement for the
solicitation of a vote of the holders of Shares approving the Merger,
which, subject to Section 4.4, shall include the recommendation of the
Company Board that holders of Shares vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and the written opinion of the
Company Financial Advisor that the consideration to be received by the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger is fair to such
shareholders from a financial point of view. The Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter
mail the Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Shareholder
Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable law. Unless this

announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined).
Within three days after the approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company, the Company shall deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice in
accordance with Section 317(b) of the Companies Law (the "Company Shareholder
Approval Notice") informing the Companies Registrar that the Merger was
approved at a general shareholders meeting of the Company. Within three days
after the approval of the Merger by Parent as the shareholder of Acquisition,
Acquisition shall deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice in accordance
with Section 317(b) of the Companies Law (the "Acquisition Shareholder
Approval Notice" and, together with the Company Shareholder Approval Notice,
the "Shareholder Approval Notices") informing the Companies Registrar that the
Merger was approved at a general shareholders meeting of Acquisition.

of any comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. All filings by
the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement

the Companys shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be subject to the prior review of Parent.  



Section 4.4. _Other Potential Acquirers_.



(a) The Company, its affiliates and their respective officers and
other employees with managerial responsibilities, directors, representatives
and agents (including the Company Financial Advisor or any other investment
banker and any attorneys and accountants retained by the Company or acting at
its behest) shall immediately cease any and all discussions or negotiations
with any persons with respect to any Third Party Acquisition. The Company also
agrees promptly to request each person, if any, that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
(whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) the Company
or any Subsidiary to return to the Company or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary. From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the
date of  



 

39  termination of this Agreement and (ii) the Effective Time, neither the
Company or any of its affiliates shall, nor shall the Company or any
Subsidiary authorize or knowingly permit any of its respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives or agents (including the Company
Financial Advisor or any other investment banker and any attorneys and
accountants retained by the Company or acting at its behest) to, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with or provide any non-public information to any person or group
(other than Parent and Acquisition or any designees of Parent
and Acquisition) concerning any Third Party Acquisition; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this subsection (a) shall prevent the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
the applicable provisions of the Companies Law with regard to any tender or
exchange offer. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two
business days after becoming aware thereof) (1) notify Parent in the event
the Company acquires knowledge that it or any of its affiliates or their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives
(including the Company Financial Advisor or any other investment banker and
any attorneys and accountants retained by the Company or acting at its
behest) receives any proposal or inquiry concerning a Third Party Acquisition,
including all material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person or group submitting such proposal, (2) provide Parent with a copy of
any written agreements, proposals or other materials the Company (or its
representatives) receives from such person or group (or its representatives)
and (3) promptly advise Parent from time to time of the status and any
developments concerning the same.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary, if the
Company receives a proposal with respect to a Third Party Acquisition which
constitutes a Superior Proposal or which the Board of Directors in good faith,
by majority vote, concludes is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal (a "Likely Superior Proposal"), the Company may, but in no event less
than 3 business days after delivering to Parent the Notice of Superior
Proposal referred to in Section 4.4(c) in the case of a Superior Proposal or
the notice referred to in Section 4.4(a) in the case of a Likely Superior
Proposal, take the following actions (either directly or through its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents):



(i) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such proposal
with respect to a Third Party Acquisition, provided, that prior to so
furnishing, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement that is at least as restrictive to the third party
as the Confidentiality Agreement; and



(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with the third
party with respect to the proposed Third Party Acquisition.



(c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.4(c), from the date hereof until the
earlier of (i) the date of termination of this Agreement and (ii)
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall not withdraw or modify its
recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby or approve or
recommend, or cause the Company or any Subsidiary to enter into any agreement
or obligation with respect to, any Third Party Acquisition. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company Board by a majority vote determines in  



 

40  its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of independent legal
counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties, the Company Board may (A) withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(B) recommend or approve any Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the
Company Board may only approve a Superior Proposal after (1) the Company has
provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising
Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
person or group making such Superior Proposal, and (2) Parent does not, within
four (4) business days after Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board by a majority vote determines
in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) to be at least as favorable to the
Companys shareholders as such Superior Proposal; _provided further_ , that
(x) no withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Boards
recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall relieve the Company of its obligation as set forth herein to submit
this Agreement and such transactions to its shareholders for approval, as
provided in Section 4.3 and (y) the Company shall not be entitled to enter
into any agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until this
Agreement is terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 6.1 and upon such
termination the Company pays or has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to
Section 6.3. Any disclosure that the Company Board may be compelled to make
with respect to the receipt of a proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or
otherwise in order to comply with its fiduciary duties or Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such disclosure states that no
action will be taken by the Company Board in violation of this Section 4.4(c).



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition" means the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the acquisition of the Company
by merger or otherwise by any person (which includes a "person" as such term
is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent,
Acquisition or any affiliate thereof (a "Third Party"); (ii) the acquisition
by a Third Party of any material portion of the assets of the Company and
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the sale, lease or license of their
products or services in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices; (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the outstanding Shares or any other securities of the
Company; (iv) the adoption by the Company of a plan of total or partial
liquidation or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend; (v)
the repurchase by the Company or any Subsidiary of more than ten percent (10%)
of the outstanding Shares or any other securities of the Company; (vi) the
acquisition by the Company or any Subsidiary by merger, purchase of stock or
assets, joint venture or otherwise of a direct or indirect ownership interest
or investment in any business whose assets, annual revenue or annual net
income is equal or greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets, annual
revenue or annual net income of the Company or (vii) a proposal for any of the
foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any
_bona fide_ proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, at least 90% of the
Shares then outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and otherwise on terms that the Company Board by a majority vote
determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally  



 

41  recognized reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys shareholders
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to be
reasonably capable of being completed (taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal).



(e) Nothing contained in Section 4.1 shall be deemed to prohibit or limit or
restrict in any manner the rights of the Company pursuant to this
Section 4.4.



Section 4.5. _Comfort Letter_. Upon request of Parent and at Parents sole

or the Nasdaq National Market, as determined by Parent, Acquisition or the
Company, as the case may be, or (ii) following a change, if any, of the
Company Boards recommendation of the Merger (in accordance with Section
4.4(b)), after which event no such consultation shall be required.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the first public announcement of this
Agreement and the Merger shall be a joint press release agreed upon by Parent
and the Company.



Section 4.10. _Indemnification and Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) For a period of not less than seven years from and after the Effective

officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
Persons") against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
counsel fees and expenses), judgments, civil fines, settlements, payments or
liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, administrative,
investigative or, unless the applicable officer or director has been found
guilty of wrongdoing in a court of law, pleads guilty or nolo contendre to
wrongdoing or admits wrongdoing in a settlement, criminal, based in whole or
in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is
or was an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, whether or not
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the
Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"); and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case to the fullest extent required or permitted under applicable law and
subject to any applicable restrictions in the Companies Law. Parent shall
also cause the Surviving Company to advance expenses to Indemnified Persons as
incurred in connection with Indemnified Liabilities to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, to the extent not advanced under
insurance policies. Nothing contained herein shall make Parent, Acquisition,
the Company or the  



 

44  Surviving Company, an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer in respect
of any insurance policies which may provide coverage for Indemnified
Liabilities, nor shall this Section 4.10 relieve the obligations of any
insurer in respect thereto. The parties hereto intend, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 4.10 shall apply without limitation to negligent acts or omissions by
an Indemnified Person. This Section 4.10 shall not limit or otherwise
adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have under any
agreement with the Company or under the Companys Memorandum of Association
or Articles of Association as currently in effect.



(b) For a period of seven years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
maintain or cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect directors and
officers liability insurance covering those persons who, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy (the "Insured Parties") on terms no less
favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the Companys present
directors and officers liability insurance policy; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend in
excess of $1,500,000 for such coverage (or such coverage as is available for
$1,500,000); _provided further_ , that, in lieu of maintaining such existing
insurance as provided above, Parent may cause coverage to be provided under
any policy maintained for the benefit of Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
so long as the terms are substantially comparable as they relate to the
intended beneficiaries thereof to such existing insurance.



(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Company
to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant
to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and
officers as of or prior to the date hereof and any indemnification provisions
under the Companys Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association as
in effect on the date hereof.



(d) The provisions of this Section 4.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such person. Parent will not
permit the Surviving Company to merge or consolidate with any other person
unless the Surviving Company will ensure that the surviving or resulting
entity assumes the obligations imposed by this Section 4.10.



Section 4.11. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition, and Parent and Acquisition
shall provide prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which has caused
or would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) any material failure of the Company, Parent or
Acquisition, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 4.11 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.



 

45 Section 4.12. _Additions to and Modification of Disclosure Letter_.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
has delivered a Disclosure Letter that includes all of the information
required by the relevant provisions of this Agreement. In addition, upon
Parents request made one time not less than 8 business days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Acquisition not less
than 3 business days prior to the Closing Date an amendment to any Sections of
the Disclosure Letter necessary to make the information set forth
therein true, accurate and complete in all material respects; _provided,
however,_ that such disclosure shall not be deemed to constitute an exception
to its representations and warranties herein, nor limit the rights and
remedies of Parent and Acquisition under this Agreement for any breach by the
Company of such representation and warranties.



Section 4.13. _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. If Parent, in its sole and
absolute discretion, provides the Company with written notice at least
three (3) days before the Closing Date, the Company and each Subsidiary that
is a plan sponsor of a 401(k) plan agrees to adopt resolutions to terminate
its 401(k) plan and fully vest plan participants immediately prior to the
Closing. If such notice is received, Parent shall receive from the Company
evidence that the Board of Directors of the relevant company has adopted
resolutions to terminate the 401(k) plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date but contingent upon the
Closing.



Section 4.14. _Lump Sum Distributions_. The Company and each Subsidiary agrees
to amend any Company or Subsidiary sponsored profit sharing plan that is
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a), including any 401(k) plan,
to provide that plan distributions shall be made solely in the form of a lump
sum and any other forms of distribution shall cease to be available after the
ninety (90) day period described in Treasury Regulation section
1.411(e)(1)(ii)(A). Such amendment shall be adopted prior to any termination
of the plan pursuant to Section 4.15 and in no event later than the Closing
Date. The Company agrees to provide or cause to be provided a summary of
material modification describing the amendment to each plan participant as
soon as administratively possible after the amendment is adopted.



Section 4.15. _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
provide that the Exercise Date (as defined in the Companys 2000 Employee
Share Purchase Plan, as amended to date (the "Company ESPP") of the current
plan period under the Company ESPP will be on the earlier of (i) 5 days prior
to the Closing Date and (ii) April 30, 2005 (the "Final Exercise Date"). The
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that following the Final
Exercise Date no additional ordinary shares of the Company will be issued
under the Company ESPP and all accumulated payroll deferrals for any plan
period after the Final Exercise Date shall be distributed to participants
under the Company ESPP immediately prior to the Closing Date.



Section 4.16. _Employee Benefits_. To the extent permitted by applicable law
and Parents applicable benefit plans, the employees of the Company employed
by the Parent or any of its affiliates (including the Surviving Company) after
the Effective Time shall be entitled to benefits which are available or
subsequently become available to Parents employees, and on a basis which is
substantially comparable with Parents similarly-  



 

46  situated employees. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to
give full credit for eligibility and/or vesting purposes and benefit accrual
for vacations for each Company employees period of service at the Company
before the Effective Time, subject to applicable law. The Companys employees
will be eligible immediately upon becoming full-time Parent employees for the
following Parent plans, subject to applicable law: 401(k) plans, health
plans, life insurance, disability plan and the flexible spending account (and,
for Company employees employed in Israel, for any current Israeli plan of
similar subject matter). To the extent consistent with applicable law, tax
qualification requirements and Parents applicable benefit plans, Parent shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing
condition (or actively-at-work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any medical plan to be
waived with respect to the Companys employees and their eligible dependents
and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and
offsets (or similar payments) made prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirement
under any Parent employee benefit programs in which they are eligible
to participate on and after the Effective Time.



Section 4.17. _Israeli Approvals_. Each party to this Agreement shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver and file, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, each notice, report or other
document required to be delivered by such party to or filed by such party
with any Israeli Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:



(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and file the notifications required, if any, under
the Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices Law in connection with the Merger;



(b) Parent and the Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries or requests received from the Israeli Restrictive Trade
Practices Commissioner for additional information or documentation;



(c) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the following
consents, and any other consents that may be necessary in connection with the
Merger: (i) written approval of the OCS to the change in ownership of the
Company to be effected by the Merger and such other matters as Parent may
reasonably request (the "OCS Approval"); and (ii) written approval of the
Investment Center to the change in ownership of the Company to be effected by
the Merger (the "Investment Center Approval"); and



(d) Parent shall provide to the OCS, the Investment Center, the Israeli
Restrictive Trade Practices Commissioner and the Israel Securities Authority
any information reasonably requested by such authorities and shall, without
limitation of the foregoing, execute an undertaking in customary form in which
Parent undertakes to comply with the OCS laws and regulations and confirm to
the OCS and the Investment Center that the Surviving Company shall continue
to operate in a manner consistent with the Companys previous undertakings to
the OCS and the Investment Center, subject to any changes set forth in the OCS
Approval and the Investment Center Approval.



 

47 Each party to this Agreement shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the commencement of any legal proceeding by or before any Israeli
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such legal proceeding and (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to the Israeli Restrictive
Trade Practices Commissioner, the OCS, the Investment Center, the Israeli
Securities Authority, the Companies Registrar or any other Israeli
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement will consult
and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with any Israeli legal proceeding relating to the Merger. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Israeli Governmental Entity or by
any Israeli legal requirement, in connection with any such legal proceeding
under or relating to the Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices Law or any other
Israeli antitrust or fair trade law, each party hereto will permit authorized
representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to any such legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Israeli Governmental Entity in connection with any such legal
proceeding.

 



Section 4.18. _Israeli Income Tax Ruling_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause its Israeli counsel
to prepare and file with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner an application
for a ruling confirming that the conversion of the Company Stock Options
into options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, but not including the
Sub-Plan Options (the "Assumed Options") will not result in a requirement for
an immediate Israeli tax payment and that the Israeli taxation will be
deferred until the exercise of the Assumed Options, or in the event of
Assumed Options which are part of a "Section 102 Plan", until the actual sale
of the shares of Parent Common Stock by the option holders, provided that any
ruling that, in Parents determination, is substantially similar to the
foregoing will be sufficient to comply with the conditions set forth in this
Section 4.18 and, provided further, that Parent is reasonably satisfied that,
in light of such ruling, Parent is not required to withhold any Taxes in
respect of the issuance of Parent Common Stock to any holder of Assumed
Options (the "Israeli Income Tax Ruling"). Parent shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain rulings from the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner
to the effect that (i) with respect to each of the Assumed Options that is
subject to Section 102 of the Income Tax Ordinance (New Version), 5721-1961
("Section 102 Options"), the requisite holding period will be deemed to have
begun at the time of the issuance of the related Company Stock Option, and
(ii) the Section 102 Options continue to be subject to the taxation schedule
elected by the Company under such Section 102 and all of the employees
income there under will continue to be characterized as capital gain (the
"Supplemental Rulings"); _provided, however_ , that for the sake of clarity,
the Supplemental Rulings are not included in the definition of "Israeli
Income Tax Ruling". Each of the Company and Parent shall cause their
respective Israeli counsel, accountants and other advisors, to coordinate all
activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation
and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli
Income Tax Ruling and the Supplemental Rulings. Subject to the terms and  



 

48  conditions hereof, the Company shall cooperate as reasonably requested by
Parent to promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
law to obtain the Israeli Income Tax Ruling and the Supplemental Rulings as
promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company will cooperate to determine if
it is appropriate to request any rulings from the Israeli Income Tax
Commissioner with respect to the Sub-Plan Options, and, if appropriate, shall
cooperate to request such rulings.



Section 4.19. _Israeli Securities Law Exemption_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause its
Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the Israeli securities authority an
application for an exemption from the requirements of the Israeli Securities
Law 1968 concerning the publication of a prospectus in respect of the
conversion of the Company Stock Options into options to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock, pursuant to Section 15D of the Securities Law of Israel
(the "Israeli Securities Exemption"). Each of Parent and the Company shall
cause their respective Israeli counsel to coordinate all activities, and to
cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such
application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may
be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Securities Exemption.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable law to obtain the Israeli Securities Exemption as promptly as
practicable.



Section 4.20. _Israeli Retirement or Pension Plans_. The Company shall take
such actions and cooperate with Parent, as Parent may reasonably request, to
amend or terminate any Israeli retirement or pension plans of the Company
prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable law.



Section 4.21. _Ruling Regarding Withholding_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause its
Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner
an application for a ruling pertaining to its obligation to withhold Israeli
income from the Merger Consideration, which application shall be substantially
in the form of Exhibit A hereto, but translated into Hebrew (the "Israeli
Withholding Ruling Application"). Parent shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain rulings requested in the Israeli Withholding Ruling
Application prior to the Effective Time.



Section 4.22. _Sub-Plan Options_. Parent and the Company shall reasonably
consider whether the terms of the Sub-Plan Options or the Tamir Fishman Trust
may be amended such that the Sub-Plan Options would become exercisable for
shares of Parent Common Stock rather than cash as a result of the Merger.
Parent and the Company shall make appropriate amendments to Section 1.10 as it
relates to the Sub-Plan Options to effect such treatment (which amendments
shall be mutually agreeable), unless Parent determines in good faith that any
such amendments cannot be made in accordance with the Sub-Plan, the Sub-Plan
Options, the Tamir Fishman Trust or applicable law, or that any such
amendments could result in liability to Parent in excess of $25,000.

not have occurred on or before such date;



(c) by the Company if (i) there shall have been a breach of any representation
or warranty on the part of Parent or Acquisition set forth in this Agreement
or if any such representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition shall have

has not breached any of its obligations hereunder in any material respect,
which breach shall not have been cured or shall be continuing at such time;
(ii) there shall have been a material breach by Parent or Acquisition of any
of its covenants or agreements hereunder, and Parent or Acquisition, as the
case may be, has not cured such breach (if capable of being cured) within

the Company has not breached any of its obligations hereunder in any material
respect, which breach shall not have been cured or be continuing at such time;
or (iii) the Company shall have convened the Company Shareholders Meeting and
shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote of its shareholders at such
meeting; or



(d) by Parent and Acquisition if (i) there shall have been a breach of any
representation or warranty on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or if any such representation or warranty of the Company shall have

respect, which breach shall not have been cured or be continuing at such
time; (ii) there shall have been a material breach by the Company of any of
its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and the Company has
not cured such breach (if capable of being cured) within twenty (20)

fails to reject a proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or fails to recommend

days after  



 

53  such proposal is received by or on behalf of the Company or such transaction
has been launched, as the case may be; or (vi) the Company shall have
convened the Company Shareholders Meeting and shall have failed to obtain the
requisite vote of its shareholders approving the Merger at such meeting.



Section 6.2. _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect without any liability on the part of any party hereto,
or any of its respective affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders,
other than the provisions of this Section 6.2 and Sections 4.7(e) and 6.3, and
all of Article 7 except for Section 7.5(d). Nothing contained in this Section
6.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination.



Section 6.3. _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:



(i) Section 6.1(d)(iii), 6.1(d)(iv) or 6.1(d)(v);



(ii) Section 6.1(c)(iii) or 6.1(d)(vi) and (A) at any time after the date of
this Agreement and before the vote on this Agreement at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, a proposal for a Company Acquisition with respect to the
Company shall be outstanding or shall have been publicly announced and not
withdrawn and (B) a Company Acquisition is consummated or the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition, in either
case, within twelve months following the termination of this Agreement; or



 

(iii) Section 6.1(b)(ii) at a time when (A) there shall be outstanding a
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) offer by a Third Party to consummate
a Company Acquisition; (B) no other condition to the Merger is unsatisfied
and (C) a Company Acquisition is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition, in either case,
within twelve months following the termination of this Agreement;



The Company acknowledges that Parent and Acquisition would suffer direct and
substantial damages, which damages cannot be determined with reasonable
certainty. To compensate Parent and Acquisition for such damages, the Company
shall pay to Parent the amount of $11,350,000 as liquidated damages
immediately upon the occurrence of the event described in this Section 6.3(a)
giving rise to such damages (a "Termination Payment"). It is specifically
agreed that the amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) and
Section 6.3(b) represent liquidated damages and not a penalty. The Company
hereby waives any right to set-off or counterclaim against such amount.



For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean any of the
following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, tender or exchange offer,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than a majority of
the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting person of such  



 

54  transaction, (ii) a sale or other disposition in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions by the Company or any Subsidiary of
assets representing in excess of thirty-five percent (35%) of the aggregate
fair market value of the business of the Company and Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately prior to such sale or (iii) the acquisition by way of
issuance by the Company or any Subsidiary by any person or group, directly or
indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership
of shares of capital stock representing in excess of thirty-five percent (35%)
of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company.



(b) (i) Upon termination of this Agreement under Section 6.1(d), 6.2(c)(iii)
or under any circumstances in which the Termination Payment is payable, in
addition to any other remedies that Parent, Acquisition or their affiliates
may have as a result of such termination, the Company shall reimburse Parent
for and pay Parent an aggregate amount equal to all costs, fees and expenses
incurred by Parent or any of its affiliates or on their behalf in connection
with this Agreement and all transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including fees payable to investment bankers, counsel to any of the foregoing
and accountants). The Company hereby waives any right to set-off or
counterclaim against such amount. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to
this Section 6.3(b)(i) shall not exceed $1,000,000 and the aggregate amount
payable pursuant to both this Section 6.3(b)(i) and Section 6.3(a) shall not
exceed $12,136,000.



(ii) Upon termination of this Agreement under Section 6.1(c)(i) or 6.1(c)(ii),
in addition to any other remedies that the Company may have as a result of
such termination, Parent shall reimburse the Company for and pay the Company
an aggregate amount equal to all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the
Company or any of its affiliates or on their behalf in connection with this
Agreement and all transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including fees
payable to investment bankers, counsel to any of the foregoing and
accountants). Parent hereby waives any right to set-off or counterclaim
against such amount. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to this Section
6.3(b)(ii) shall not exceed $1,000,000.



(c) Except as specifically provided in this Section 6.3, each party shall bear
its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that fees and
expenses incurred in connection with any filings required under the HSR Act or
similar foreign merger notification laws, other regulatory filings, or any
stamp duty or other documentary taxes shall be shared equally by the Company
and Parent, and each will promptly reimburse the other upon request for its
share of such expenses paid by the other party.



Section 6.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Acquisition at any time before or after approval of the
Merger by the shareholders of the Company but after any such approval no
amendment shall be made that requires the approval of such shareholders under
applicable law without such approval. This Agreement (including, subject to
Section 4.12, the Disclosure Letter) may be amended only by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Acquisition may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this

consents and other communications hereunder shall be (and shall only be
effective if) in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been
duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by facsimile or by registered

party in accordance herewith. Any such notice or communication shall be deemed
to have been delivered and received (A) in the case of personal delivery, on
