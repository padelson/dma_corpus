ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the "
_Merger_ ") with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place: (i) in New York City at the offices of
Covington and Burling LLP, The New York Times Building, 620 Eighth Avenue, New
York, New York 10018 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than three
(3) Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (so
long as such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied), but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions; or
(ii) at such other place or time or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and
shall make all other filings or

 



     

 

 



 

recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger).

 



 

(d) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights,
powers, privileges, immunities, licenses, franchises and authority and be
subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities
of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under this Agreement and the
DGCL.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive $48.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, each certificate formerly
representing any Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each Share formerly
represented in book-entry form (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and all Shares represented thereby shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock and each Share held by
Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company,
in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

SECTION 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) the Certificates and (ii) the Book-Entry Shares. On the Closing Date,
Parent or one of its Affiliates shall make available to the Paying Agent, as
needed, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of all the
Shares converted in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and represented by the
Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (such cash, the " _Consideration Fund_
"). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the
Merger Consideration (including on account of any Merger Consideration
returned to Parent pursuant to Section 2.03(h)) or any Merger Consideration
becomes payable after a holder of Shares fails to perfect, waives, withdraws
or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under

 



     

 

 



 

Section 262 of the DGCL, Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be
delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount equal to the
deficiency required to make such payments. The Consideration Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) With respect to Certificates, promptly (and in any event not later than
the third (3rd) Business Day) after the Effective Time , Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of each such
Certificate (i) a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate as provided in Section 2.09) to the Paying Agent (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (iii) instructions for surrendering a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.09) to the
Paying Agent. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.09)
together with a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent pursuant to
such instructions, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
payable for each Share represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section
2.02(a). Any Certificate that has been so surrendered shall be canceled by the
Paying Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and
subject to the terms of Section 2.04, each such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a " _Non-DTC
Book-Entry Share_ "), promptly (and in any event not later than the third
(3rd) Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall
cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of a Non-DTC Book-
Entry Share (i) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a Letter of Transmittal and (iii) instructions for surrendering
the Non-DTC Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares by book-receipt of an "agents message" by
the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and
accompanying instructions, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration payable for each such Non-DTC Book-Entry Share pursuant
to Section 2.02(a).

 



 

(d) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, the Company and Parent
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and DTC to
ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Shares held of record
by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures, the Merger Consideration payable for each such Book-Entry Share
pursuant to Section 2.02(a).

 



 

(e) With respect to any Certificate or Non-DTC Book Entry Share, if any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Non-DTC
Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that
(i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall

 



     

 

 



 

otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Non-DTC Book-Entry Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any Taxes required to be paid by the Paying
Agent, Parent or their respective Affiliates as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Non-DTC Book-
Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) Until disbursed in accordance with this Agreement, the cash in the
Consideration Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares and (ii) following any
such losses or events that result in the Consideration Fund becoming not
immediately available or that result in the amount of funds in the
Consideration Fund being insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Shares to the extent of such insufficiency. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent.

 



 

(g) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 



 

(h) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (and any earnings, interest or other
income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its
Affiliates, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such
time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates upon
demand.

 



 

(j) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares canceled in accordance with
Section 2.02(a)) and held by a holder who did not vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with
all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled only
to such rights as a granted by Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such holder
fails to perfect, waives, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. If, either before or after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws or otherwise loses the right
to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the appraisal
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted pursuant to Section 2.02(a) as of the Effective Time into,
and shall represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.03 upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such Share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may
be. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of
any such demand, and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, offer to
settle or settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

SECTION 2.05. _Company Stock Awards_.

 



 

(a) Effective at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (or
portion thereof) to acquire Shares granted or issued pursuant to any Equity
Incentive Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ "), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, canceled and converted into the
right to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, solely an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable per Share exercise price of such canceled Company Stock
Option multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the per Share exercise price under any Company Stock
Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Stock Option shall be canceled as of the Effective Time without payment
therefor and shall have no further force or effect. From and after the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable by
the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment
of the corresponding amount determined in accordance with this Section
2.05(a), if any.

 



 

(b) Effective at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted
stock unit granted or issued pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Company RSUs_ " and, together with Company Stock Options, " _Company Stock
Awards_ "), whether or not then vested, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, canceled and

 



     

 

 



 

converted into the right to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, solely
an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in any event
no later than the later of twenty (20) days following the Closing and the
Companys first regular payroll date following the Closing, Parent shall, or
shall cause, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof to pay, through
Parents, the Surviving Corporations, or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll
system (and subject to withholding, if any, as provided in Section 2.08), to
each former holder of a Company Stock Award that is a current or former
employee of the Company, such holders payment due in accordance with Section
2.05(a) or 2.05(b), as the case may be. If any payment due under Sections
2.05(a) or 2.05(b) is payable to a holder of a Company Stock Award that is not
a current or former employee, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a
check for such payment to such former holder (less applicable withholding
Taxes, if any), which check will be sent by overnight courier to such former
holder as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors or the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall take
all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to effectuate the treatment of
Company Stock Awards as contemplated in this Section 2.05 (including obtaining
any required consents from holders of Company Stock Awards) and to terminate,
effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing, the Equity Incentive Plans, except with respect to the rights to
payments contemplated in this Section 2.05.

 



 

SECTION 2.06. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company, the Board of
Directors and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, as
applicable, shall take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the
Companys 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and all
outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and to otherwise
effectuate the treatment of the ESPP as contemplated in this Section 2.06.
From and after the date hereof, (a) no new participants shall be permitted to
participate in the ESPP, (b) participants may not increase their payroll
deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (c) except for the offering or purchase period under the ESPP
that is in effect on the date hereof (the " _Final Offering Period_ "), no
offering or purchase period shall be authorized, continued or commenced
following the date hereof. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final
Offering Period, (i) the final exercise date under the ESPP shall be such date
as the Company determines in its sole discretion ( _provided_ that such date
shall be no later than the date that is five (5) days prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "), (ii) each ESPP participants accumulated
contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase whole Shares in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, which
Shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a), (iii) the ESPP
shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing, and no further rights shall be granted or exercised
under the ESPP thereafter and (iv) as promptly as practicable following the
purchase of Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (ii), the Company
shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such

 



      

 

 



 

participants account after such purchase. To the extent required by the ESPP,
the Company shall provide notice to all ESPP participants describing the
treatment of the ESPP pursuant to this Section 2.06, subject to Parents right
to review consistent with Section 7.03(e).

 



 

SECTION 2.07. _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares (or
securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Shares) shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class
(including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares or similar transaction, or stock dividend or distribution thereon with
a record date during such period), the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change so as to provide Parent and the holder of Shares (or
securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Shares) the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
Nothing in this Section 2.07 shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to any Company Securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.08. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
payment of the Merger Consideration and any other amount payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement any amount that is required to be deducted and
withheld under applicable Tax Law. Any amount that is properly deducted and
withheld by the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 



 

SECTION 2.09. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

Subsidiaries as currently conducted. There exist no material restrictions on

Subsidiaries, as applicable, has a valid license or sublicense to use the
Licensed Intellectual Property Rights in connection with the operation of its
business as currently conducted and contemplated to be conducted, subject only
to the terms of the Contracts contemplated by Section 4.19(a) and the

Agreement will not (i) alter, encumber, impair or extinguish any rights of the
Company or its Subsidiaries under any Company Intellectual Property, (ii)
impair the right of Parent to develop, use, sell, license or dispose of, or to

(d) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been or is being used in any material respect to create, in whole or in part,
any material Company Intellectual Property, except for use of facilities or
personnel that does not result in such Governmental Authority or educational
institution obtaining ownership of, or use rights to, such Company
Intellectual Property, and does not require or otherwise obligate the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any such Governmental
Authority or educational institution any license or other right to such
Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no current or
former Service Provider who contributed to the creation or development of the
Owned Intellectual Property Rights has performed services for a Governmental
Authority or any university, college, research institute or other educational
institution related to the Companys business as presently conducted during a
period of time during which such Service Provider was also performing services
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

connection with the prosecution and maintenance of applications or
registrations for the Owned Intellectual Property Rights have been timely
paid, except for such fees pertaining to applications or registrations which
the Company has decided in its good faith business judgment not to pay because
the applications or registrations are no longer economically justifiable or
needed for the conduct of the business. All necessary documents, recordations,
and certificates in connection with the applications or registrations for the
Owned Intellectual Property Rights have been filed with the relevant Patent,
Copyright, Trademark, or other authorities in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights registered in such jurisdictions, except for such
applications or registrations which the Company has decided in its good faith
business judgment to withdraw, abandon, or allow to lapse, in each case
because they are no longer economically justifiable or needed for the conduct
of the business. There are no actions that must be taken by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date that, if not
taken, will result in the loss of any of the Owned Intellectual Property
Rights, including the payment of any registration, maintenance, or renewal
fees or the filing of any responses to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or
equivalent authority) actions, documents, applications, or certificates for
the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, or preserving or renewing
any of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights, except for such Owned
Intellectual Property Rights which the Company has decided in its good faith
business judgment are no longer economically justifiable or needed for the
conduct of the business.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no, and since January 1, 2017
there has been no, Action pending against, or threatened against or affecting,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or affecting the conduct of the
respective businesses of the Company or

 



     

 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries as presently conducted (including the Exploitation of
any Company Product) (i) based upon, or challenging or seeking to deny or
restrict, any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any of the
Company Intellectual Property, or (ii) alleging that any of the Company
Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no information, materials, facts, or circumstances that

unenforceable or would adversely affect any pending application for any of the
Owned Intellectual Property Rights. To the Knowledge of the Company, it has
not misrepresented, or failed to disclose, and there are no misrepresentations
of or failure to disclose, any fact or circumstance in any application for any
Owned Intellectual Property Rights that would constitute fraud, inequitable
conduct, or a misrepresentation with respect to such application or that would
otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of any such Owned Intellectual
Property Rights.

 



 

(g) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, contributed
to the infringement of, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property Right of any Person, except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There is no, and since January 1, 2017, there has been no,
Action pending against or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
or affecting, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or affecting the conduct
of the respective businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted (including the research, development, manufacture,
marketing, promotion, offering for sale, sale or other commercialization,
shipment, import, export or distribution, as applicable, of any Company
Product) (i) alleging that the use of any of the Company Intellectual Property
or any services provided, processes used or products manufactured, used,
imported, offered for sale or sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
do or may conflict with, misappropriate, infringe, contribute to the
infringement of, or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right of any
Person or (ii) alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any Person. Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received from any Person any offer to license any
Intellectual Property Rights of such Person in connection with any actual or
threatened claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
such Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(h) None of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights has been adjudged invalid
or unenforceable in whole or part, or in the case of pending Patent
applications included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights, have been the
subject of a final and unappealable finding of unpatentability. All issued
Patents, registered Trademarks and registered Copyrights included in the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights are, to the Knowledge of the Company, valid,
enforceable, in full force and effect and subsisting in all material respects.

 



 

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated any Owned Intellectual Property Right or any
Intellectual Property Right exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



     

 

 



 

(j) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
actions in accordance with current industry practice to maintain the
confidentiality of all Intellectual Property Rights of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, the value of which to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof (including any
Trade Secrets owned, used or held for use by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), and no such confidential Intellectual Property Rights have been
disclosed, and access to such Intellectual Property Rights has not been
provided to any Person, other than to employees, Independent Contractors,
Service Providers, representatives and agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and Third Parties who had a need to know such information, all
of whom are bound by written confidentiality agreements that protect such
Intellectual Property Rights. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Service
Provider or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default or
breach of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, or any
confidentiality provisions of any employment agreement or other such
agreement, with the Company or such Subsidiary relating to the protection,
ownership, development, use, or transfer of any Intellectual Property Rights
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(k) To the extent that any Intellectual Property Right has been developed or
created by a Third Party (including any current or former Service Provider)
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has a written agreement with such Third
Party with respect thereto pursuant to which such Person has agreed to hold
all Intellectual Property Rights in confidence, and the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries thereby either (i) has obtained ownership of and is the exclusive
owner of, or (ii) has obtained a valid and unrestricted right to Exploit,
sufficient for the conduct of its business as currently conducted or disclosed
in the Company SEC Documents as being proposed to be conducted, such
Intellectual Property Right. In each case where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has acquired any Intellectual Property Rights from any Person
(including any Service Provider), the Company or such Subsidiary obtained a
valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights
in such Intellectual Property Rights to the Company or such Subsidiary, and
the Company or such Subsidiary has recorded each such assignment with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or its respective equivalents in any relevant
foreign jurisdiction.

 



 

(l) Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will have all of the
rights of the Company under the Company Intellectual Property, to the same
extent that the Company would have had if the Merger had not occurred, and
without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than
ongoing fees, royalties, or payments that the Company would otherwise be
required to pay.

 



 

(m) The IT Assets operate and perform in a manner that permits the Company and
its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted
in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has
gained unauthorized access to the IT Assets. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries take commercially reasonable actions in accordance with current
industry practice to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of
the material IT Assets (and all information and transactions stored or
contained therein or transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use,
access, interruption, modification or corruption, including the implementation
of commercially reasonable (i) data backup,

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) disaster avoidance and recovery procedures and (iii) business continuity
procedures, in each case consistent with current industry practices. Since
January 1, 2017, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries have experienced any cybersecurity incidents, or
unauthorized use, access, intrusion or theft, and there have been no outages
of, or disruptions to, the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries, IT Assets
that have materially and adversely affected the operation of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(n) Since January 1, 2017, the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in
all material respects with (i) all applicable Laws relating to privacy, data
protection and the collection and use of personal information gathered or
accessed by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the course of the operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) all published rules, policies and
procedures established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to the foregoing. Since January 1, 2017, the Company has not received written
notice, and is not otherwise aware of, any claims that have been asserted or
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person
alleging a violation of such Persons privacy, personal information,
confidentiality or other sensitive or protected data or rights under any
applicable Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, there have been no material
security breaches in the information technology systems used by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy

the Finance Documents have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The

any material Tax accounting method, (ii) amend any income Tax Return or other
material Tax Return, or (iii) without the prior written consent of Parent,
enter into any closing agreement with respect to Taxes, settle any material
Tax claim, audit or assessment, or surrender any right to claim a material Tax
refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability; or

 



 

(s) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing;

 



 

 _provided_ that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision

 



     

 

 



 

over their respective businesses, assets and properties. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no consent of Parent shall be
required with respect to any matter set forth in this Section 6.01 or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent
would, upon the advice of outside antitrust legal counsel, violate applicable
Antitrust Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.02. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders  Meeting_. (a) As
promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than twenty (20) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, in
consultation with Parent, and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Subject to Section 6.04(d)(ii), the Company and the Board of
Directors shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its respective Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement, and each of the Company and Parent covenants that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) will, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or on the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed in
accordance with this Agreement), contain any untrue statement of any material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments (written or oral) of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements
thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating them to
the Companys stockholders and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider
any comments proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company will cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed at the earliest reasonably practicable
date to the Companys stockholders entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (and in any event no later than twenty (20) days before
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting), and shall use its reasonable
best efforts (subject to Section 6.04) to obtain the necessary adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon. If, at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not false or misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and correct such
information, and the Company shall file an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information with the SEC.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and
notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote
(the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") with a record date and meeting date
to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent, which meeting date
shall be no later than thirty (30) Business Days after (i) the tenth day after
the preliminary Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC (or if such date
is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) if by such date the
SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement
or (ii) if by such tenth day the SEC has informed the Company that it intends
to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with 6.04(d)(ii), the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall (A)
provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results on a timely basis and (B) give written notice to Parent
one day prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and on the day of, but
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, indicating whether as of such date
sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent; _provided_ that if at any time following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement, either the Company or Parent determines
in good faith that the Requisite Company Vote is unlikely to be obtained at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, then
each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to require an adjournment
or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional votes in favor of the adoption of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed in accordance with the foregoing sentence by more than
an aggregate of thirty (30) days from the originally-scheduled date, or to a
date on or after the fifth Business Day preceding the End Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting if (1) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, or (2) the Board of
Directors or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or
appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in order
to give the Companys stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information
or disclosure that the Company has sent or otherwise made available to such
holders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise
(in each case so long as any such information or disclosure was made in
compliance with this Agreement). Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change,
(x) the Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company
for adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (y) the only matters to
be voted upon at the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be the Requisite
Company Vote and routine proposals required in connection with such vote (and
not any other matters, including any Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

SECTION 6.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms and the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall (i) give to

 



     

 

 



 

Parent, its counsel, lenders (including the Financing Sources), financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the offices,
properties, facilities, assets, books, records, officers, employees,
consultants and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to
Parent, its counsel, lenders, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information (including the work papers of the Companys independent
accountants upon receipt of any required consents from such accountants and
subject to the execution of customary access letters) as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct the employees, consultants, agents,
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in its investigation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.03 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 



 

(b) The foregoing provisions of Section 6.03(a) shall not require and shall
not be construed to require the Company to permit any access or any inspection
or review, or to disclose or otherwise make available any information that the
Company determines in its reasonable judgment, (i) would violate any
applicable Law which restricts or otherwise prohibits access to such documents
or information, (ii) would violate any obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to any Third Party or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate, constitute a default under, or give a
Third Party the right to terminate or accelerate an obligation under, any then
effective Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
(iii) would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information, (iv) relate to the evaluation or
negotiation of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or,
subject to Section 6.04, an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, or (v)
would result in the disclosure of personal information that would expose the
Company to the risk of liability. In the event that the Company does not
provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall
use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to
Parent in a way that would not violate any applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or waive any privilege.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall: (i) provide Parent with advance notice of
and an opportunity for one designated Representative of Parent to participate
as an observer in any meetings or conference calls the Company has with the
FDA or its advisory committees, or any other similar Governmental Authority;
(ii) consider in good faith and, to the extent reasonable to do so,
incorporate, any comments or other input provided by Parent in respect of the
foregoing; (iii) promptly notify Parent of any notice or other communication
to the Company from the FDA or its advisory committees, or any other similar
Governmental Authority, or a Review Board, and, subject to applicable Law,
permit Parent to review in advance any proposed written communication to such
Governmental Authority, as considered appropriate by Parent, and consider
Parents reasonable comments; (iv) furnish Parent with non-confidential copies
of all correspondence, filings and written communications between the Company,
its Affiliates and their respective

 



     

 

 



 

Representatives, on one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its
staff, on the other hand; and (v) consult with Parent prior to making any
significant submission to the FDA or any similar Governmental Authority, or a
Review Board, relating to the Companys business or any Company Product, or
supplement or amendment thereto, response to any warning letter, untitled
letter, or observation on FDA Form 483, and shall give Parent reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any such submission prior to its
submission to such Governmental Authority.

 



 

(d) From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to: (i) diligently conduct its Patent prosecution practice in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and in material compliance with
applicable Law and the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or
similar foreign office; (ii) promptly notify Parent of any notice or other
communication to the Company or such Subsidiary from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office or any similar foreign office, and consider in good faith
and, to the extent reasonable to do so, incorporate, any comments or other
input provided by Parent in respect of the foregoing; (iii) furnish Parent
with non-confidential copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives, on one hand, and any such office or its staff, on the other
hand; and (iv) consult with Parent prior to making any significant submission
to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any similar foreign office relating
to the Companys or such Subsidiarys Patent prosecution practice, response to
any rejection or any similar communication from such office, and shall give
Parent reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such submission
prior to its submission to any such office.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein, and the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent, its counsel, lenders (including the Financing Sources),
financial advisors, auditors or other authorized representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.03.

 



 

SECTION 6.04. _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation; No
Solicitation_. (a) _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, agents, and other advisors or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly:

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or knowingly take any action designed to facilitate any inquiry
regarding, or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (in each
case, other than discussions solely to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions of any unsolicited inquiry, offer or proposal, to the extent
necessary to determine

 



     

 

 



 

whether such inquiry, offer or proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal);

 



 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (in
each case, other than (A) to state that the terms of this Section 6.04
prohibit such discussions or negotiations, or (B) discussions solely to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any unsolicited inquiry,
offer or proposal, to the extent necessary to determine whether such inquiry,
offer or proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal);

 



 

(iii) furnish any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to nonpublic information relating to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Third Party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iv) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, and only if, the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to amend or grant any waiver or release under
any such standstill or similar agreement would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under the DGCL, the Company may then amend or
grant a waiver or release under such standstill or similar agreement, solely
to the extent necessary to permit a Third Party to make, on a confidential
basis to the Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon
such Third Party agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent
as contemplated by this Section 6.04; or

 



 

(v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (in each case,
other than discussions solely to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions of any unsolicited inquiry, offer or proposal, to the extent
necessary to determine whether such inquiry, offer or proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a) or any other provision in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, in
response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal received after the date
of this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04, the Company may:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) furnish information in response to a request therefor (including nonpublic
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the Person
who made such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives; _provided_ that (A)
such information has previously been made available to, or is made available
to, Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such
information is made available to such Person and (B) prior to furnishing any
such information, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company and a copy of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement is provided to Parent; and

 



 

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such
Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that,
based on the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty four (24) hours) give notice to Parent if, after entry
into this Agreement, (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any information is requested in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or
negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or had with, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii), it or any of
its Representatives, setting forth in such notice the name of such Person and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, complete copies of any material written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
informed, on a reasonably current basis (and, in any event, within twenty four
(24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any material amendments thereto).

 



 

(d) _No Change of Recommendation_.

 



 

(i) Except as permitted by Section 6.04(d)(ii) and Section 6.04(e), the
Company agrees that the Board of Directors and any committee thereof shall
not:

 



 

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Board Recommendation, in
each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub;

 



 

(B) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 



 

(C) fail to (x) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, and (y) recommend
against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act for outstanding Shares, in each
case, within ten (10)

 



     

 

 



 

Business Days after receipt of a written request of Parent following an
Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced (and not publicly
withdrawn) (in the case of clause (x)) or the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer (in the case of clause (y)) or, in each case, if
earlier, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that the
taking of no position or a neutral position by the Board of Directors in
respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the
end of such period shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of any such offer; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors shall
not be required to make any reaffirmation in the case of clause (x) more than
one time with respect to any Acquisition Proposal unless there shall have been
a publicly disclosed change regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, or other agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in compliance with Section
6.04(b)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A),
(B), (C) and (D), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



 

(E) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Board of Directors may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.01(d)(i) in order to enter into a binding and definitive written
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each
case only if: (A)(1) a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal received after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from or arise in connection
with a breach of the Companys obligations set forth in Section 6.04(a) is
received by the Company and is not withdrawn, and the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event has occurred; and (B) the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to take such action
described in this Section 6.04(d)(ii) in response to such Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to
taking such action, the Company has given Parent written notice (the " _Board
Recommendation Notice_ ") of such action and the basis therefor five (5)
Business

 



     

 

 



 

Days in advance, which Board Recommendation Notice shall set forth in writing
that the Board of Directors intends to consider whether to take such action
and (x) in the case of a Superior Proposal, include the information required
pursuant to Section 6.04(c) and (y) in the case of an Intervening Event,
include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event. After
giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to taking any action in
response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event as described in the first
sentence of this Section 6.04(d)(ii), the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Acquisition
Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal or cause such Intervening Event to
cease to warrant an Adverse Recommendation Change. At the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to taking any action in
response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event as described in the first
sentence of this Section 6.04(d)(ii), the Board of Directors shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent and any other information offered by Parent in response to the Board
Recommendation Notice, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that,
(I) in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening Event, such
Intervening Event remains in effect and (II) the failure to take such action
described the first sentence of this Section 6.04(d)(ii) in response to such
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under the DGCL, in each case, if such
changes offered or proposed in writing by Parent were to be given effect. Any
amendment to the financial terms and any other material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of Section 6.04(c) and this Section 6.04(d)(ii) and require a new
Board Recommendation Notice, except that references in this Section
6.04(d)(ii) to "five (5) Business Days" shall be deemed to be references to
"three (3) Business Days" and such three (3) Business Day period shall expire
at 11:59 p.m. on the third Business Day immediately following the day on which
such new Board Recommendation Notice is delivered (it being understood and
agreed that in no event shall any such additional three (3) Business Day
period be deemed to shorten the initial five (5) Business Day period).

 



 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.04
shall prevent the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations
under Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) issuing "stop, look and listen" communications
or similar communications of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act); _provided_ that this Section 6.04(e) shall not be deemed to
permit the Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except,
in each case, to the extent permitted by Section 6.04(d)(ii).

 



 

(f) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause

 



      

 

 



 

their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party, its Representatives and its financing sources
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third
Party, its Representatives and its financing sources in possession of
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all such
information as promptly as practicable. The Company will promptly terminate
all physical and electronic "data room" or similar access previously granted
to any such Persons.

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and the Board of Directors (or a duly formed committee thereof satisfying the
applicable requirements of the 1934 Act) shall take all such steps as may be
reasonably required or appropriate to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
1934 Act.

 



 

SECTION 6.06. _Stock Exchange Delisting; 1934 Act Deregistration_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the
deregistration of the Shares under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after
the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.07. _Takeover Statutes_. In the event that any "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, the Company and the
Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take all actions necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such other actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

SECTION 6.08. _Interim Communications by the Company_. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material communications broadly disseminated
to Service Providers, lenders, material suppliers and other Persons having
material business relationships with the Company or its Subsidiaries relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which communications shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, be inconsistent in substance
with any public statements made jointly by the parties or made by one party in
accordance with Section 8.03.

 



 

SECTION 6.09. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax Sharing Agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is party shall be terminated with respect to the
Company and

 



     

 

 



 

each Subsidiary as of the Effective Time and shall have no further effect
thereafter. Any payment to be made by the Company or any Subsidiary under any
Tax Sharing Agreement shall be made prior to the Closing Date, and no payment
thereunder shall be required to be made after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent (i) a statement, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent,
certifying that the Company is not, and has not been during the applicable
period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a "United States
real property holding company" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code, which statement shall satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), together with (ii) a notice prepared
and executed in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h) to be
mailed by Parent (with a copy of the statement described in clause (i)) to the
IRS in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parents only recourse for the Companys failure to provide
such certificate and notice or any defect in such certificate and notice shall
be the ability to withhold Tax from the Merger Consideration as required by
applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.10. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any Action (including any putative class action or derivative
litigation) asserted, threatened in writing or commenced by, on behalf of or
in the name of, against or otherwise involving the Company, the Board of
Directors, any committee thereof or any of the Companys directors or officers
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (any such Action, a " _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably prompt basis regarding any such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to (a) participate
in the defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of any Transaction
Litigation, and (b) consult with counsel to the Company regarding the defense,
prosecution, settlement or compromise with respect to any such Transaction
Litigation. For purposes of this Section 6.10, "participate" means that Parent

decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company
shall consider in good faith; _provided_ that the Company shall not settle or
compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction Litigation without
Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

SECTION 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 7.02. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, as the case may be,
to (i) honor and

 



     

 

 



 

fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under the (A) Contracts listed on Section 4.19(a)(x) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (B) indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation
provisions in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, in each case in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person against any losses incurred by such Indemnified Person
in respect of any Action based upon or arising out of the fact that such
Indemnified Person was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable Law and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that,
such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to
time under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents or in such documents of any
successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase
directors and officers insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") or "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of six years from the Effective Time, in each case with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as those contained in the Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof, in each case with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to the foregoing an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium amount paid by the Company for such DandO Insurance in its last
full fiscal year prior to the date hereof, which amount is set forth in
Section 7.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than such amount, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain DandO Insurance (or "tail" coverage) with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, Parent may, at its sole discretion, request that the Company
obtain, in which case the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain,
prior to the Effective Time, prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies providing
such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years
with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in case such prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies are
so obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time: (A) the provisions of
the preceding sentences of this Section 7.02(c) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied; and (B) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for
their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case in clause (i) or (ii), to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
DGCL or any other applicable Law, or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

SECTION 7.03. _Employee Matters_. (a) For the 12-month period following the
Effective Time (or, if shorter, during the applicable period of employment of
a Continuing Employee), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide Continuing Employees with: (i) a base salary or base wages and
cash target bonus opportunity that, in each case, is no less than those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) other benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those offered by the Company to the Continuing Employees as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any equity or equity-based and change
in control or transaction-based compensation or benefits or post-employment
health or welfare benefits); and (iii) severance pay to Continuing Employees
terminated without "Cause" in accordance with Parents severance policy, and
subject to entering into Parents standard release and separation agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for
the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock
appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock
of any entity or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements.

 



 

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other employee
benefit plan or other compensation or severance arrangement of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, but excluding (i) any retiree healthcare or life
insurance plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) any equity compensation arrangement and (iii) any defined benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in which any
Continuing Employee will participate on or after the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service with the Company or any
Subsidiary rendered prior to the Effective Time by Continuing Employees for
purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual (other than under any
defined benefit pension plans) under the terms of such Parent Benefit Plans.
In no event shall anything contained in this Section 7.03(b) result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. In addition, Parent
shall (x) waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived
under any comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries applicable to
such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time

 



     

 

 



 

and (y) use reasonable best efforts to recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,

calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(c) No later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a list of each "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the Company and (i) the Companys
reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount (separately identifying
single and double-trigger amounts and Tax gross-up payments, if any) that
could be paid to such disqualified individual as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event), (ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the
Code) for each such disqualified individual and (iii) underlying documentation
on which such calculations are based. Such information shall be updated and
delivered to Parent not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall reasonably cooperate
with Parent to limit potential adverse Tax consequences under Section 280G of
the Code.

 



 

(d) No later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) a version of the Employee
Schedule that includes, in addition to the information already provided, the
following: name, work location, start date, immigration status and whether a
Form I-9 is on file, and (ii) a full and complete list of each current
Independent Contractor as of the date hereof with an annual base compensation
in excess of $50,000, including each such Independent Contractors name, work
location, description of services, consulting or contracting term, consulting
or contracting fee, and an indication of whether such Independent Contractor
has entered into a Contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate the Employee Plans
required to be terminated pursuant to Sections 2.05(d) and 2.06. All
resolutions, amendments, notices or other documents issued, adopted or
executed in connection with the termination of such Employee Plans shall be
subject to Parents prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

(f) This Section 7.03 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.03,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Service Provider or former Service
Provider (including any beneficiary or dependent of such Service Provider or
former Service Provider), or any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.03. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied: (i) except as expressly required in this Section
7.03, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any Employee Plan; (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or
(iii) shall prevent the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Service Provider
(including any Continuing Employee) following the Effective Time. This Section
7.03 shall not create any right in any Service Provider (including any
Continuing Employee) or any other Person to any continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or

 



     

 

 



 

compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, or otherwise alters
any existing at-will employment relationship between any Service Provider and
the Surviving Corporation.

Subsidiaries (but, absent such request, the Company shall not take any such

consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any Action by a Third Party,
with any other Person, and to the extent reasonably practicable, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

in full force and effect notwithstanding (A) any Adverse Recommendation
Change, (B) the public proposal or announcement or other submission to the
Company or any of its Representatives of an Acquisition Proposal or (C)
anything in this Agreement to the contrary.

of the Financing), including the execution and delivery of customary
representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders, confirming

omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, as soon
as reasonably practicable after obtaining Knowledge thereof (it being
understood that (A) to the extent any Required Information is contained in any
Company SEC

 



     

 

 



 

Documents, such inclusion shall constitute delivery to Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder and (B) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no
circumstances shall the Company be required to provide any financial
statements hereunder that are not required to be included in any Company SEC
Document, including any Company SEC Documents filed after the date hereof);

 



 

(v) deliver to Parent and Merger Sub (A) within 40 days after the end of any
fiscal quarter that is not a fiscal year end, the unaudited consolidated

sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year and the related audited
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows (it being understood that

Documents, such inclusion shall constitute delivery to Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder and (B) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no
circumstances shall the Company be required to provide any financial
statements hereunder that are not required to be included in any Company SEC
Document, including any Company SEC Documents filed after the date hereof);

Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, to be made available on the Closing Date
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 



 

(ix) no later than five (5) Business Days after request by Parent at least ten

other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required by
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent requested by Parent,
Merger Sub or their potential financing sources.

 



 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in
a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein
or in any other agreement between the Company and Parent (or their respective
Affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates may share
customary

 



      

 

 



 

projections with respect to the Company and its business, which are hereby
approved for distribution by the Company, with their potential financing
sources and other prospective lenders in connection with any marketing efforts
undertaken as part of the Financing; _provided_ that the recipients of such
information agree to be bound by customary confidentiality arrangements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
directors or officers or other personnel shall be required by this Section
8.06 to: (i) take any action or provide any assistance (A) that unreasonably
interferes in any material respect with the ongoing operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, (B) to the extent it would reasonably be expected to
cause any representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement to be
breached or any condition to the Closing set forth in Article 9 to fail to be
satisfied or (C) that the Company reasonably believes would result in a
violation by it or any of its Subsidiaries of any Material Contract or any
material confidentiality arrangement (having taken reasonable steps to procure
permission to take the action or provide the assistance requested of the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary) or the loss of any legal or other
applicable privilege by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner
that would be materially adverse to their respective interests; (ii) execute
or deliver any Contract that by its terms becomes effective prior to the
Closing Date or is not capable of being terminated without liability to the
Company or any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement; (iii)
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, take any corporate
or similar action in connection with the Financing that is not conditioned on
the occurrence of the Effective Time; (iv) except as set forth in clause
(i)(C) above, agree to any amendment or modification, effective prior to the
Closing, of any existing Contract to which it is a party; or (v) pay any
commitment or other similar fee in connection with the Financing prior to the
Closing Date. In each case, the Companys cooperation shall be at Parents
written request, and Parent shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith. No
Affiliate of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than its Subsidiaries) shall have any obligations under this Section 8.06
following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company hereby agrees with and consents to the disclosure to any Financing
Sources (or potential financing sources) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives of any Required Information or any other
information provided by the Company or its Representatives in accordance with
this Section 8.06, for purposes of and in connection with the Financing (in
the case of any nonpublic information with respect to the Company, solely to
the extent that is subject to customary confidentiality arrangements).

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing has not
been obtained, Parent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, continue to be obligated to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, until such time as the Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , in any case, that the conditions
set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waived.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 8.07. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Finance Documents, and Parent shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision be granted under,
the Finance Documents, except that, without the prior consent of the Company,
Parent may amend the Finance Documents to: (i) amend pricing terms (including
pursuant to any "market flex" provisions contained in any side letter); (ii)
replace or add lenders, arrangers, underwriters, book-runners, agents or
similar entities; or (iii) make any other changes that do not (A) reduce (or
could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of any portion of the
Financing, if such reduction would reduce the aggregate amount of Financing
below the amount required, when taken together with all other sources of
funding available for payment thereof, to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date (subject to the provisions in the final
sentence of this Section 8.07(a)), (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the Financing Conditions in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the Financing Conditions) on the Closing Date or
(C) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Finance Documents. For purposes of Section 5.06, Section 8.06
and this Section 8.07, references to "Financing" shall include the Financing
contemplated by the Finance Documents as it may be amended, modified or
replaced in accordance with this Section 8.07(a), and references to "Finance
Documents" shall include such documents as they may be amended, modified or
replaced in accordance with this Section 8.07(a). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right to replace all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Finance Documents with any other debt or equity financing, from the same or
any alternative financing sources, so long as such substitute financing would
not impose new, revised or additional conditions precedent to the availability
of such financing relative to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of
such financing relative to the Financing or otherwise adversely impact the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect 
the Finance Documents and (ii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), on a timely
basis, all Financing Conditions (not including any condition where the failure
to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish any
information described in Section 8.06(a)) that are within Parents control, so
as to consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Parent shall give the Company notice as soon as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of a Financing Adverse Event; _provided_ that Parent
shall not be required to provide any such notice or additional information in
connection with such notice to the extent disclosure would be prohibited under
applicable Law or such disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege. If all or any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable as a result of a Financing Adverse Event, and such portion
is required, when taken together with all other sources of funding available
for payment thereof, to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, then Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange

 



     

 

 



 

and obtain in replacement thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with available cash of Parent and any then-available
Financing pursuant to the Finance Documents, to consummate the Merger.

sole and exclusive remedy for damages against the Company and its former,
current or futures stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or

representation,

 



     

 

 



 

warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or the failure of
the Merger to be consummated; _provided_ that no such payment shall relieve
any party of any liability or damages to any other party resulting from any
fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree

fees or expenses) incurred by the Company or on the Companys behalf in
connection with or related to the entry into this Agreement, in an amount in

change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger
Sub.

(a) The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not
have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such
Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Action against any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. The parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for
the purpose of any Action against the Financing Sources (in their capacities
as such) in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby brought by any party hereto and
(ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is

 



     

 

 



 

improper or that this Agreement or the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby may not be enforced in or by the above-named
court.

 



 

SECTION 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE).

 



 

SECTION 11.10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed manually or by
facsimile or other electronic transmission by the parties (including in .pdf,
.tiff, .jpg or similar format), in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument.

 



 

SECTION 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule), the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 11.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

SECTION 11.14. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, except for: (a) solely if the Effective
Time occurs, (i) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and (ii) the right of the holders of Company Stock Awards and
participants in the Companys ESPP to receive the applicable treatment
pursuant to Article 2 in accordance with the

 



     

 

 



 

terms of this Agreement; (b) the provisions set forth in Section 7.02 with
respect to the Persons referred to therein; and (c) the provisions set forth
in Section 11.03(c), Section 11.07(b), Section 11.08(b), Section 11.09,
Section 11.15 and this Section 11.14 (in each case, to the extent they relate
to the Financing Sources) which are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.03 without notice
or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

SECTION 11.15. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any claim against any Financing Source,
nor shall any Financing Source have any liability whatsoever to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with the Financing or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in each case,
whether arising, in whole or in part, out of comparative, contributory or sole
negligence by any Financing Source.
