-iii-    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  ----------------------------  
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 19, 2000,
by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
J Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Justin Industries, Inc., a Texas corporation
(the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the Board of
Directors of Purchaser, and the Board of Directors of the Company have
approved, and determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders to consummate, the transactions provided for
herein; and   WHEREAS, Parent and Purchaser have proposed acquiring all of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, of the
Company (the "Shares" or the "Company Common Stock") together with the
associated rights to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Rights") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of October 6, 1989, as amended (the
"Rights Agreement") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Rights
Agent thereunder, at a price of $22.00 per Share in cash; and   WHEREAS,
the Company, Parent and Purchaser desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer (as defined
herein) and the Merger (as defined herein); and   WHEREAS, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to Parent\'s
and Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser have entered into a Stockholder Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, the form of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Stockholder
Agreement"), with the stockholder named therein (the "Stockholder"), pursuant
to which the Stockholder has, among other things, (1) agreed to tender all
Shares (including Shares to be acquired upon conversion of the Series Two
Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, par value $2.50 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Preferred Stock" and collectively with the Company Common
Stock, the "Company Stock") owned by the Stockholder pursuant to the Offer,
(2) granted to Parent an option to purchase all of the Shares owned by the
Stockholder, and (3) agreed to vote all Shares beneficially owned by
the Stockholder in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and against any
Takeover Proposal (as defined herein), in each case subject to and on the
conditions set forth therein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   
ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND MERGER   Section 1.1 The Offer.  ---------  
Provided this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than seven (7)
business days after the public announcement of the execution hereof), the
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act") ) an offer (the "Offer") to purchase for cash all of the
Shares (and associated Rights) at a price of $22.00 per Share, net to
the seller in cash (such price, or such higher price per Share as may be paid
in the Offer, being referred to herein as the "Offer Price"), subject only to
the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto; provided, however, that Parent
may  -------- ------- designate another wholly owned, direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent as the bidder (within the meaning of Rule 14d-1(g) under
the Exchange Act) in the Offer, in which case reference herein to Purchaser
shall be deemed to apply to such subsidiary, as appropriate. The Company
shall not tender Shares held by it or by any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
the Offer. The Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, on
the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to the Offer, accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered as soon as it is
legally permitted to do so under applicable law.   The Offer shall be made
by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") containing the
terms set forth in this Agreement and only the conditions set forth in Annex
A hereto and providing for an initial expiration date (the "Expiration Date")
of twenty (20) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange
Act) from the date of commencement. The Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser not to, decrease the Offer Price or decrease the number
of Shares sought, amend the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A or
impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex A,
without the prior written consent of the Company. The Purchaser may, without
the consent of the Company, (A) extend the Offer for the shortest time
periods which it reasonably believes are necessary, but in no event more than
an additional forty (40) days, in one or more periods of not more than ten
(10) business days, if Parent and Purchaser are not in material breach of
this Agreement and if any condition to the Offer is not satisfied or waived
and such condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied and (B) if, on
the Expiration Date, the Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer equal at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
outstanding Shares but less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
Shares (on a fully diluted basis, as such term is defined in Annex A), extend
the Offer on one occasion for up to ten (10) business days notwithstanding
that all the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied so long as Purchaser
irrevocably waives the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the Offer
(other than in the case of paragraph (a) of Annex A hereto the occurrence of
any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or preliminary or permanent
injunction making illegal or prohibiting the consummation of the Offer) that
subsequently may not be satisfied during any such extension of the Offer. In
addition, the Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to
the   2   extent required by law in connection with such increase, in
each case without the consent of the Company.   On the date the Offer is
commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule
TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and
a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (the Schedule TO,
the Offer to Purchase and related letter of transmittal and related summary
advertisement, together with any amendments and supplements thereto,
collectively the "Offer Documents"). The Offer Documents shall comply in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws
and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Parent or the Purchaser with respect to information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent
and Purchaser shall further take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false and misleading in any material respect and the
Purchaser further shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule TO (and shall provide any comments
thereon as soon as practicable) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In
addition, Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser to, provide the Company
and its counsel in writing with any comments that Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments and with copies of any
written responses and telephonic notification of any verbal responses by
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel.   Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.   Section
1.2 Company Actions.  ---------------   The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of Directors, at a
meeting duly called and held, has (i) approved this Agreement (including all
terms and conditions set forth herein) and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger (as defined in Section 1.4)
(collectively, the "Transactions"), determined that the Merger is advisable
and that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company\'s stockholders and   3   recommended that the
Company\'s stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder to
the Purchaser and approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger; provided,
that such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended  -------- as
provided in Section 5.2(b). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of its Board of Directors
described in the immediately preceding sentence.   Concurrently with the
commencement of the Offer or as promptly thereafter as practicable, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall contain the
recommendation referred to in Section 1.2 (a) hereof unless such
recommendation has been withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been
modified or amended, in each case in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with
the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company\'s
stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made
by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or
the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company further shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, and shall mail such
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company promptly after commencement
of the Offer, together with the initial mailing of the Offer to Purchase.
Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false and
misleading in any material respect and the Company further shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and
comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 (and shall provide any comments thereon as
soon as practicable) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In addition,
the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel in writing
with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments and with copies of any written responses and telephonic notification
of any verbal responses by the Company or its counsel.   In connection with
the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent
with such additional information, including updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels and security position listings, and such other information and
assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the stockholders of the Company. Except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and subject to the
requirements of applicable law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser
and each of their affiliates, associates, employees, agents and advisors to,
hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and  
4   lists and the additional information referred to in the preceding
sentence, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and
Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Company all copies of such information then in its
possession or control or the possession or control of its agents or
representatives.   Section 1.3 Directors. Promptly upon the purchase by
Purchaser of Shares  --------- pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time
thereafter as Shares are acquired by Purchaser, Parent or their affiliates,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will
give Purchaser, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act,
representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to that number
of directors which equals the product of the total number of directors on the
Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors appointed
or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving
as officers of the Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of their
affiliates (including for purposes of this Section 1.3 such Shares as are
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries) bears to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding. At such times, if requested
by Purchaser, the Company will use its best efforts to cause each committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of each
subsidiary of the Company to include persons designated by
Purchaser constituting the same percentage of each such committee and the
Board of Directors of each subsidiary of the Company as Purchaser\'s
designees are of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company shall,
upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company as is necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees to
be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Section 1.3 and shall cause Purchaser\'s designees to be so
elected; provided, however, that, if  -------- ------- Purchaser\'s
designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company,
until the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the
date hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor
designees, stockholders, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the
federal securities laws) of Parent (one or more of such directors, the
"Independent Directors"); provided further, that if less than two (2)
Independent Directors remain, the remaining Independent Director (if any) or
if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors, shall designate
persons to fill the vacancies who shall not be either officers of the Company
or designees, shareholders, affiliates or associates of Parent, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly
after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an
information statement pursuant to Rule 14f- 1 if Purchaser has not
theretofore designated directors) such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent
and Purchaser will supply the Company and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, during the period after the election of
directors designated by Purchaser pursuant   5   to this Section 1.3 but
prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
delegate to a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company comprised
solely of the Independent Directors (the "Committee") the sole responsibility
for (i) the amendment or termination of this Agreement (in either case in
accordance with this Agreement) on behalf of the Company, but excluding a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) hereof, which is not
delegated, (ii) the waiver of any of the Company\'s rights or remedies
hereunder, (iii) the extension of the time for performance of Parent\'s or
Purchaser\'s obligations hereunder, or (iv) the assertion or enforcement of
the Company\'s rights under this Agreement to object to (a) a failure to
consummate the Merger for a failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2
to be satisfied or (b) a termination of this Agreement under Section
7.1(d)(iii).   Section 1.4 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this  ---------- Agreement and the provisions of the Texas Business
Corporation Act (the "Texas Act"), at the Effective Time, the Company and the
Purchaser shall consummate a merger (the "Merger") pursuant to which (a) the
Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company
shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") under the name "Justin Industries, Inc." and shall continue to
be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, and (c) the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective
Time, (x) the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as
desired by Parent and as so amended shall become the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as
provided by law and such articles of incorporation, (y) the bylaws of
the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by law, the articles of incorporation and such bylaws. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the Texas Act.   Section 1.5 Effective Time.
Parent, Purchaser, and the Company shall  -------------- cause appropriate
Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") to be executed and filed on the
date of the Closing (as defined in Section 1.6) (or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Texas (the "Secretary of State") as provided in the Texas Act. The Merger
shall become effective on the date on which the Articles of Merger have been
duly filed with the Secretary of State or such later time as is agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger, and such time
is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."   Section 1.6 Closing.
The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take  ------- place at 10:00
a.m., on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than the second business day,
after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Munger, Tolles and Olson, 355
South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   Section 1.7 Directors and
Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The 
--------------------------------------------------- directors of the
Purchaser and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving   6   Corporation until their successors
shall have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
articles of incorporation and bylaws.   Section 1.8 Stockholders\'
Meeting.  ---------------------   If required by applicable law in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors,
shall, in accordance with applicable law:   (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the "Special Meeting") as
soon as practicable following the acceptance for payment and purchase of
Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer;   (ii) prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary proxy or information statement relating to the Merger
and this Agreement and use its reasonable efforts (x) to obtain and furnish
the information required to be included by the federal securities laws (and
the rules and regulations thereunder) in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter
defined) and, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information
statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement (the "Proxy
Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders and (y) to obtain the necessary
approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its stockholders; and   (iii)
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement, unless such recommendation has
been withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified or amended, in
each case in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.   Parent
shall provide the Company with the information concerning Parent and
Purchaser required to be included in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall vote,
or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it, the Purchaser or
any of its other subsidiaries and affiliates in favor of the approval of the
Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.   Section 1.9 Merger Without
Meeting of Stockholders. In the event that 
-------------------------------------- Parent, the Purchaser or any other
Subsidiary of Parent, shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the
then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of
the Company, in accordance with Article 5.16 (in lieu of Article 5.03) of the
Texas Act.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by 
--------------------------- virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders of any shares of Company   7   Common Stock or
of the common stock, par value $.0l per share, of the Purchaser (the
"Purchaser Common Stock"):   Purchaser Common Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share of  ---------------------- the Purchaser Common Stock
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.0l per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned
Stock. All  ----------------------------------------------------- shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, all
shares of Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any
other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (in each case together with
associated Rights) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   Conversion of
Shares. Each issued and outstanding share of  -------------------- Company
Common Stock (together with associated Rights), other than Shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) hereof and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof), shall be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Company Common Stock (and
associated Rights) in the manner provided in Section 2.2 hereof. All such
shares of Company Common Stock (and associated Rights), when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares (and associated Rights) shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2 hereof, without interest.   Section 2.2 Exchange of
Certificates.  ------------------------   Paying Agent. Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company  ------------ (the "Paying Agent")
reasonably acceptable to the Company to make the payments of the funds to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof. When and as needed, Parent shall make
available to the Paying Agent such funds for timely payment hereunder.
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent.   Exchange
Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time but in  ------------------- no
event more than three (3) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares
were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the  
8   Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (subject to subsection (e), below) for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.   Transfer Books; No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common 
------------------------------------------------------------- Stock. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be ----- closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.   Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time
following 180  --------------------------------- calendar days after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificates such stockholder holds, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   Withholding Taxes. If so
specified in the Offer Documents,  ----------------- Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or Merger such amounts as Parent, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") or any provision of state, local or  
9   foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the deduction and
withholding was made.   Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any
provision of this  ----------------- Agreement to the contrary, if and to
the extent required by the Texas Act, shares of Company Common Stock which
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto (the "Dissenting Common
Stock") in accordance with Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the Texas Act,
shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and holders of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Dissenting Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Texas Act unless
and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise
lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the Texas Act. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such shares of Dissenting Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable
for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then
the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder\'s
Dissenting Common Stock pursuant to Article 12 of the Texas Act shall cease.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of shares of Dissenting Common Stock. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisals or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.   Section 2.4 Company Option Plans. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Board of  -------------------- Directors of Parent and the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Option Plans (as defined below)) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:   Adjust the terms of all outstanding stock options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted
under the Company\'s 1981 Stock Option Plan, 1984 Incentive Stock Option
Plan, 1992 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan or
1999 Performance Incentive Plan, each as amended (the "Option Plans"), to
provide that each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall (except to the extent that Parent and the holder of a
Company Stock Option otherwise agree in writing prior to the Effective Time):
(i) vest immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) if such Company Stock
Option has an exercise price of less than the Offer Price, unless the holder
of such Company Stock Option shall have elected by written notice to Parent
prior to the date 15 business days prior to the Effective Time to receive the
consideration contemplated by clause (iii), be cancelled at the Effective
Time in exchange for a payment from the Surviving Corporation (subject to any
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (2)
the excess of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of
Company   10   Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, payable
in cash immediately following the Effective Time; or (iii) with respect to
any Company Stock Option not cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) above, at the
Effective Time, be assumed by Parent, or substituted with a new option issued
by Parent, so that such Company Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the terms and conditions of Parent\'s 1996 Stock Option
Plan, as amended, (x) the number of shares of Parent Class B common stock,
par value $.1667 per share ("Parent Class B Stock") (which shares shall be
registered pursuant to an effective registration statement) equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option and (2) 0.0113519 (the "Parent Class B
Exchange Ratio"), provided that any fractional shares of Parent Class B Stock
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share, at (y) a price per share equal to (1) the exercise price for the
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company
Stock Option divided by (2) the Parent Class B Exchange Ratio, provided that
such exercise price shall be rounded up or down to the nearest cent.  
Except as provided in subsection (a) above, the Option Plans and any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any
subsidiary shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall
ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option
nor any participant in any such plan, program or arrangement shall have any
right thereunder to acquire capital securities of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as
follows:   Section 3.1 Corporate Organization. Each of the Company and its 
---------------------- subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries (as
defined below) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, when
aggregated with all other such failures, a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on the Company ("Company Material Adverse Effect"). As used in
this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, a material adverse
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of such party and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole or a material adverse effect on the
party\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that a "Material Adverse Effect" shall not include
any of the -------- ------- following or any combination of the following:
any change or effect resulting from or attributable to (A) general national,
international or regional economic or financial conditions, (B) other
developments which are not unique to the Company and its subsidiaries, but
also affect other persons who engage in the lines of business in which the
Company or its subsidiaries are   11   engaged, (C) the announcement or
pendency of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, if resulting therefrom, employee attrition and delay, reduction
or cancellation or change in the terms of orders or purchases from or other
transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries), and (D) any change in the
market price of the Company Common Stock, Parent Class A Common Stock, par
value $5.00 per share, or Parent Class B Stock, or any portfolio securities
owned by Parent or its subsidiaries. As used in this Agreement, (i) the word
"subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any
corporation, partnership or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of the Board
of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly beneficially
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries,
or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries, and (ii) "Significant
Subsidiary" has the meaning given such term in Rule 405 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Articles" and "Company
Bylaws"), as most recently filed with the Company\'s SEC Documents (as
hereinafter defined), are true, complete and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.   Section 3.2
Capitalization.  --------------   The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000
shares of Company Preferred Stock. At the close of business on June 19, 2000,
there were 25,775,603 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding,
100 shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding (all of which
are owned beneficially and of record by the Stockholder), and 1,705,885
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
Company Stock Options pursuant to the Option Plans. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(a) of the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered to Parent
concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Stock have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.
Except as set forth above or in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement there are not and, as of the
Effective Time there will not be, any shares of capital stock issued and
outstanding or any subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
securities of the Company, including any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any Company Stock (other than the Rights and
the conversion rights of the Company Preferred Stock set forth in the
Company\'s Articles).   Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its Significant
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse
rights or claims and security interests whatsoever ("Liens") which would
reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and all of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. None of the
Company\'s Significant Subsidiaries has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character   12   calling for the purchase or issuance of any security of
such Significant Subsidiary, including any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Significant Subsidiary.   Section 3.3 Authority. 
---------   The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject to obtaining the approval of
holders of 66-2/3% of the shares of Company Common Stock prior to the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with Article 5.03 of the Texas Act,
if so required. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby, have been duly authorized by its Board of Directors and, except for
obtaining the approval of its stockholders as contemplated by Section 1.8
hereof and as required by the Texas Act, no other corporate action on the
part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other parties thereto, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity.   The Board of Directors of the Company has
approved and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board of
Directors for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Company.   Section 3.4 Consents and Approvals; No
Violations.  -------------------------------------   Except for (i) the
consents and approvals set forth in Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) the filing with the SEC of the Offer Documents and, if
necessary, of the Proxy Statement, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas pursuant to the Texas Act,
(iv) if necessary, the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite votes of
the stockholders of the Company and (v) filings, permits, authorizations,
consents and approvals as may be required under, and other applicable
requirements of, the Exchange Act and the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), no consents
or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations with, any federal,
state or local court, administrative or regulatory agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (each a
"Governmental Entity"), are necessary for the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such other consents,
approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made
or given, would not reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   Except as set forth in Section 3.4(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company nor the   13   consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any
of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of
the similar organizational documents of any of its Significant Subsidiaries
or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to
in Section 3.4(a) and the authorization hereof by the Company\'s stockholders
are duly obtained in accordance with the Texas Act, (x) violate any statute,
code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with,
result in the loss of any material benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case
of clause (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
losses, terminations of rights thereof, accelerations or Lien creations
which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.5 SEC Documents; Undisclosed
Liabilities. The Company has filed 
-------------------------------------- all required reports, schedules, forms
and registration statements with the SEC since January 1, 1998 (collectively,
and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the "SEC Documents"). As of their
respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents (including
any and all financial statements included therein) as of such dates contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included
in the SEC Documents (the "SEC Financial Statements") comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (except,
in the case of unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments). Since December 31, 1999, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries, has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required, if
known, to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP except (i) as and to the extent
set forth on the audited balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1999 (including the notes thereto), (ii) as incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as
incurred   14   after December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice, (iv) as described in the SEC
Documents filed since December 31, 1999 (the "Recent SEC Documents"), or (v)
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 3.6 Broker\'s Fees. Except as set forth in Section
3.6 of the  ------------- Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any subsidiary of the Company nor any of their respective officers or
directors on behalf of the Company or such subsidiaries has employed any
financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any liability for any
broker\'s fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.7 Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Except as disclosed in  ------------------------------------ the
SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in Section
3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 1999, (a) no
events have occurred which would reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (b) the Company and its
subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, except for such deviations of the Company\'s business from the
ordinary course of business which would not reasonably be expected to have,
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.8 Legal
Proceedings.  -----------------   Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents
or in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which proceedings, claims, actions, or
investigations, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   Except as set forth in the SEC Documents
or in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no injunction,
order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company,
any of its subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries which, when aggregated with all other such injunctions, orders,
judgments, decrees and restrictions, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.9 Compliance with Applicable
Law. Except as disclosed in  ------------------------------ Section 3.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its subsidiaries
hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses as presently conducted
and are in compliance with the terms thereof, except where the failure to
hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such
noncompliance would not, when aggregated with all other such failures or
noncompliance, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any material violations of any applicable law, statute,
order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental  
15   Entity relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which, in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 3.10 Company Information. The information
relating to the Company  ------------------- and its subsidiaries to be
provided by the Company to be contained in the Proxy Statement, if any, or
the Offer Documents, or in any other document filed with any other
Governmental Entity in connection herewith at the respective times filed with
the SEC or such other Governmental Entity and first published, sent or given
to stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date it or any amendment or supplement is mailed to holders
of the shares of Company Common Stock, at the time of the Special Meeting and
at the Effective Time, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 (except that no representation is made by the
Company to such portions thereof that relate only to Parent or any of their
subsidiaries or to statements made therein based on information supplied by
Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion therein) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.   Section 3.11 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The
Company\'s Board of  ---------------------------- Directors has received the
opinion of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, financial advisor to the Company\'s
Board of Directors, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock is fair to the holders of such shares from a
financial point of view.   Section 3.12 Employee Matters. The Company has
delivered or made  ---------------- available to Parent full and complete
copies or descriptions of each material employment, severance, bonus, change-
in-control, profit sharing, compensation, termination, stock option, stock
appreciation right, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance unit,
pension, retirement, deferred compensation, welfare or other employee benefit
agreement, trust fund or other arrangement and any union, guild or collective
bargaining agreement maintained or contributed to or required to be
contributed to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as defined
below), for the benefit or welfare of any director, officer, employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (such plans
and arrangements being collectively the "Company Benefit Plans"). Each of
the Company Benefit Plans is in material compliance with all applicable
laws including ERISA and the Code except where such noncompliance would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Internal Revenue Service has determined that each Company Benefit Plan that
is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified and the Company is aware of no event occurring after the date of
such determination that would adversely affect such determination. The
liabilities accrued under each such plan are reflected on the latest balance
sheet of the Company included in the Recent SEC Reports in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. No
condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA
or to a civil penalty under Section 502(j) of ERISA or liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA or 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or the loss of a
federal tax deduction under Section 280G of the Code or other liability with
respect to the Company Benefit Plans that would have a   16   Company
Material Adverse Effect and that is not reflected on such balance
sheet. There are no pending or to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened,
claims (other than routine claims for benefits or immaterial claims) by, on
behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related
thereto except where such claims would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any
person, any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together
with such person would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA").   Section 3.13 Environmental Matters. Except as set
forth in Section 3.13  --------------------- of the Company\'s Disclosure
Schedule, there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions, causes of action, required environmental remediation
activities or, to the knowledge of the Company, governmental investigations
of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be expected to
result in the imposition, on the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any
liability or obligations arising under common law standards relating to
environmental protection, human health or safety, or under any local, state,
federal, national or supernational environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (collectively, "Environmental Laws"),
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, which liability or obligation would have or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of the Company, during or prior to the period of (i) its or any
of its subsidiaries\' ownership or operation of any of their respective
current properties, (ii) its or any of its subsidiaries\' participation in
the management of any property, or (iii) its or any of its subsidiaries\'
holding of a security interest or other interest in any property, there was
no release or threatened release of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or
dangerous materials or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws in,
on, under or affecting any such property which would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any material liability or obligations pursuant to or
under any Environmental Law that would have or would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.14 Takeover Statutes.
The Company has taken all actions  ----------------- necessary such that no
restrictive provision of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other similar anti- takeover
statute or regulation (including, without limitation, Article 13 of the Texas
Act) (each a "Takeover Statute") or restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the governing documents of the Company is, or at
the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, Parent, the Purchaser,
the shares of Company Stock, the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 3.15 Rights Agreement. The Company
has taken all action required  ---------------- so that the entering into of
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not enable or
require the Rights to be separated from the shares of Company Common Stock
with which the Rights are associated, or to be distributed, exercisable,
exercised, or nonredeemable or result in the Rights   17   associated
with any Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or any of its
affiliates or associates (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to be void
or voidable. The Company has delivered to Purchaser a true and correct copy
of the Rights Agreement, as amended in accordance with its terms to render
it inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.   Section
3.16 Properties. Except as disclosed in the Recent SEC Documents 
---------- and for any of the following which would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its subsidiaries (i) has
good and indefeasible title to all the properties and assets reflected on the
latest audited balance sheet included in such Recent SEC Documents as being
owned by the Company or one of its subsidiaries or acquired after the date
thereof which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company\'s business on a consolidated basis (except properties sold or
otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business), free and clear of (A) all Liens except (1) statutory liens
securing payments not yet due and (2) such imperfections or irregularities of
title or other Liens (other than real property mortgages or deeds of trust)
as do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations at such properties, and (B) all real property mortgages
and deeds of trust except such secured indebtedness as is properly reflected
in the latest audited balance sheet included in such Recent SEC Documents,
and (ii) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest
audited financial statements included in such Recent SEC Documents or
acquired after the date thereof which are material to its business on a
consolidated basis and is in possession of the properties purported to be
leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid without material default
thereunder by the lessee or, to the Company\'s knowledge, the lessor.  
Section 3.17 Tax Returns and Tax Payments. The Company and its 
---------------------------- subsidiaries have timely filed (or, as to
subsidiaries, the Company has filed on behalf of such subsidiaries) all
material Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by it, except
for such failure that would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and its subsidiaries have paid (or, as to subsidiaries, the
Company has paid on behalf of such subsidiaries) all Taxes (as defined below)
shown to be due on such Tax Returns or has provided (or, as to Subsidiaries,
the Company has made provision on behalf of such Subsidiaries) reserves in
its financial statements for any Taxes that have not been paid, whether or
not shown as being due on any Tax Returns, except for such Taxes which, if
unpaid or unreserved, would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has granted any request that
remains in effect for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.17 of the Company\'s Disclosure Schedule, no claim for
unpaid Taxes has been asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in writing by a Tax authority which, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. There
are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes
that are being disputed in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which adequate reserves have been taken, that could result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as discussed in Section 3.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no audit of any material Tax Return of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is being conducted by a Tax authority.
None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has made an  
18   election under Section 341(f) of the Code. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than the
Company and its subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law). As used herein,
"Taxes" shall mean all taxes of any kind, including, without limitation,
those on or measured by or referred to as income, gross receipts, sales, use,

or applications, domain names and tangible or intangible proprietary
information or materials that are used in the respective businesses of the
Company and its subsidiaries as currently conducted, except for any such
failures to own, be licensed or possess that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely in the future to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All patents, registered trademarks and
service marks and registered copyrights held by the Company or its

Agreement, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would constitute
a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under

this and the following sentences and to compliance with Section 5.2(a)) (x)
withdraw or modify its approval, determination, or recommendation of the

contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders; provided, however,
neither the Company  -------- ------- nor its Board of Directors nor any

or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer

transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries,

Company and its stockholders than the Offer and the Merger, and (C) for which
the third party has demonstrated that financing is reasonably likely to be

faith judgment (based on the advice of independent financial advisors and
outside counsel). Any Superior Proposal is a Takeover Proposal.   Section

action so deliberated or (B) arising out of, based upon or attributable to
the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage to which they
were not legally entitled. Parent, Purchaser, and the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated
by Section 145(e) of the DGCL or Article 2.02-1 of the Texas Act, as
applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified
Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and Parent and
Purchaser, (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to,   28   pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii)
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter,
provided that none of Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent,
which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.8, upon learning
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify
an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have under this Section 5.8 except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e) of the DGCL or
Article 2.02-1 of the Texas Act. The Indemnified Parties as a group may
retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each such matter
unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties.   Section 5.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any
time after the  --------------------- Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.   ARTICLE

consummation of the Offer as though made on or as of such date, or the
Company shall have breached or failed in any material respect to perform or

Agreement to be performed or complied with by it (including without
limitation if the Company shall have entered into any definitive agreement or
any agreement in principle with any person with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or similar business combination with the Company in violation of
Section 5.2), except, in the case of the failure of any representation or
warranty, for changes specifically permitted by the Agreement, and for those

with the Offer or with such acceptance for payment or payments.   The
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and may

Proxy Statement are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent or given

STOCKHOLDERS\' COVENANTS   Each Stockholder hereby jointly and severally
covenants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:   Section 2.1 Voting of
Shares. Stockholder hereby agrees that from the date hereof until the
termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 4.2 (the "Term"), at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company however called and in any action
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, Stockholder shall vote
its Shares (i) in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, (ii) against
any Takeover Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and against any
proposal for action or agreement that would result in a breach of
any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement
of the Company under the Merger Agreement or which is reasonably likely to
result in any of the Company\'s obligations under the Merger Agreement not
being fulfilled, any change in the directors of the Company (except as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement), any change in the present
capitalization of the Company or any amendment to the Company\'s corporate
structure or business, or any other action which could reasonably be expected
to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or materially adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the
likelihood of such transactions being consummated and (iii) in favor of any
other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement which is considered at any such meeting of shareholders
or in such consent, and in connection therewith to execute any documents
which are necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the foregoing,
including the ability for Purchaser or its nominee(s) to vote the Shares
directly.   Section 2.2 Proxy. Stockholder hereby revokes all prior proxies
or powers of attorney with respect to any of its Shares. During the
Term, Stockholder hereby constitutes and appoints Parent and Purchaser, or
any nominee designated by Parent and Purchaser, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution at any time during the Term, as its true and
lawful attorney and proxy ("Proxy"), for and in its name, place, and stead,
to demand that the Secretary of the Company call a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company for the purpose of considering any matter
referred to in Section 2.1 and to vote each Share held by Stockholder as  
-3-   its Proxy in respect of any such matter, at every annual, special,
adjourned, or postponed meeting of the stockholders of the Company, including
the right to sign its name (as stockholder) to any consent, certificate, or
other document relating to the Company that the law of the State of Texas
might permit or require. THE FOREGOING PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY ARE
IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE TERM. Stockholder
will take such further action and execute such other documents as may be
necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section 2.2.   Section 2.3
Conversion. Provided that all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
waived by Parent and Purchaser, Stockholder hereby agrees to take such
actions as are required to convert all shares of Company Preferred Stock
owned by Stockholder into Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Expiration Date of the Offer.   Section 2.4 Tender. Stockholder hereby
agrees to tender in the Offer, prior to the Expiration Date, all Shares of
Company Common Stock (including all such Shares acquired upon conversion of
Company Preferred Stock) owned beneficially and of record by it. Stockholder
hereby acknowledges and agrees that Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s obligation to
accept for payment and pay for such Shares in the Offer is subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in Annex A to the Merger Agreement. Without
the consent of Stockholder, Purchaser will not purchase any such Shares
tendered by Stockholder unless the Minimum Condition has been satisfied and
not waived by Purchaser and Parent.   Section 2.5 Restrictions on Transfer,
Proxies and Non-Interference. Stockholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement
is in effect, and except as contemplated hereby, not to (i) sell, transfer,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract,
option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale,
transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any of the
Shares, (ii) grant any proxies, deposit any Shares into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Shares, or (iii) take any
action that would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder
contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the
effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing Stockholder\'s
obligations under this Agreement.   Section 2.6 Disclosure. Stockholder
hereby authorizes Parent and Purchaser to publish and disclose in the Offer
Documents and, if approval of the Company\'s stockholders is required under
applicable law, the Proxy Statement (including all documents and schedules
filed with the SEC), its identity, its ownership of Company Securities, and
the nature of its commitments, arrangements, and understandings under this
Agreement.   Section 2.7 No Solicitation. Stockholder covenants and agrees
that, during the Term, it shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal from any person (other
than from Parent or Purchaser) relating to (i) any acquisition of any Shares
or (ii) any transaction that constitutes a Takeover Proposal. Stockholder
further covenants and agrees that, during the Term, it shall not participate
in any discussions or negotiations (except with Parent or Purchaser)
regarding, or furnish to any person (other than Parent or Purchaser) any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in or facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any person (other than Parent and Purchaser) to make, any transaction  
-4-   that may constitute a Takeover Proposal. Stockholder immediately
shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations of Stockholder and its agents, or other representatives with any
person (other than Parent and Purchaser) with respect to any of the
foregoing. Stockholder shall notify Parent and Purchaser promptly of any such
proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person with respect
thereto, of which it becomes aware and shall, in any such notice to Parent
and Purchaser, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the person
making such proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact and the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section to the contrary, Stockholder may, and if any agent,
or representative of Stockholder is a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company, such member of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in his or
her capacity as such director, take such actions, if any, as are permitted by
Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement.   ARTICLE III   COMPANY SECURITIES
OPTION   Section 3.1 Grant of Option. In order to induce Parent and
Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder hereby grants
to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Company Securities
Option") to purchase the Stockholder\'s Shares at a price per Share (the
"Offer Price") equal to $22.00 in cash or any higher price paid or to be paid
by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.2 below, but excluding
any price paid to any shareholder who exercises dissenters\' rights in
connection with the Merger. The Company Securities Option shall be
exercisable pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2 below.   Section 3.2
Exercise of Company Securities Option. The Company Securities Option (i)
shall become exercisable, in whole but not in part, for all Shares subject
thereto (less any such Shares which Purchaser has accepted for payment or
paid for in the Offer) at the close of business upon the Expiration Date (or,
if for any reason later, immediately after the expiration of the period,
including any extensions thereof, during which shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer may by the terms of the Offer be accepted or
rejected) or, if later, the date on which (x) all waiting periods under the
HSR Act or other applicable law shall have expired or been waived and (y)
there shall not be in effect any preliminary or final injunction or
other order issued by any court or governmental, administrative, or
regulatory agency or authority prohibiting the exercise of the Company
Securities Option pursuant to this Agreement, if, but only if, (I) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, when added to the
number of Shares not tendered, if any, that are subject to the Company
Securities Options, will satisfy the Minimum Condition, (II) if the number of
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer is not sufficient to
cause the Minimum Condition to be satisfied, Parent and Purchaser shall have
waived the Minimum Condition, and (III) Purchaser has accepted for payment
all shares of Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer,
and (ii) shall remain exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days after the
first such date on which the Company Securities Option becomes exercisable
pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence. If the Company Securities Option
does not become exercisable under this Section 3.2 due to (a) the termination
or withdrawal of the Offer prior to the Expiration Date (or the later date
specified in the second   -5-   parenthetical of this Section 3.2), or
(b) the failure of Purchaser to accept for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer, it shall be deemed to
have expired. In the event that Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the
Company Securities Option, Parent or Purchaser, prior to the expiration
thereof, shall send a written notice to Stockholder identifying the place for
the closing of such purchase at least two (2) business days prior to such
closing.   Section 3.3 Subsequent Sale. If, prior to the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time and (ii) the date which is eighteen (18) months after
the exercise of the Company Securities Option by Parent or Purchaser, Parent
or Purchaser sells any or all of the Shares purchased from Stockholder to
an unaffiliated third party (a "Subsequent Sale") at a per share price in
excess of the Offer Price (the "Subsequent Sale Price"), then Parent or
Purchaser will pay to Stockholder, within five (5) days of receipt of payment
by Parent or Purchaser for such Shares, an amount equal to the excess of the
Subsequent Sale Price over the Offer Price multiplied by the number of shares
sold in the Subsequent Sale.   ARTICLE IV   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 4.1
Definitions. Terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement, have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement.   Section 4.2
Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect (i) by the written mutual consent of the parties hereto or (ii)
automatically and without any required action of the parties hereto upon the
earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the closing of the exercise
of the Company Securities Option or the expiration of the Company Securities
Option, whichever occurs earlier. The termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement
prior to termination.   Section 4.3 Non-Survival. The representations and
warrants made herein shall terminate upon Stockholder\'s sale of its Shares
to the Purchaser in the Offer or pursuant to Section 3.2.   Section 4.4

4.5 Severability. In the event that any provision in this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted as to the jurisdiction involved but only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal, and enforceable. The validity,
legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality, or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any
other jurisdiction.   Section 4.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the
Merger Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect thereto.   Section 4.7
Assignment. No party may assign or delegate this Agreement or any right,
interest, or obligation hereunder, provided that Parent or Purchaser, in its

Events. Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to Stockholder\'s Shares and shall be binding upon any person or
entity to which legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares shall pass,
whether by operation of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding any transfer of
Shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all
obligations under this Agreement.   Section 4.12 No Waiver. The failure of
any party hereto to exercise any right, power, or remedy provided under this
Agreement or otherwise available at law or in equity, the failure of any
party hereto to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its
obligations hereunder, or the existence of any custom or practice of the
parties at variance with the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver by
such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power, or remedy
or to demand such compliance.   Section 4.13 Specific Performance. The
parties hereto acknowledge that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
