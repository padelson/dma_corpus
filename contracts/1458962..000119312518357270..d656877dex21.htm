Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the "Charter"), will be amended and
restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate

Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation
will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the

prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the

(a) _Capital Stock_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or by
Parent and the applicable holder, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will
occur:

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.000004 per share, of Merger
Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

 

(ii) each share of Company Class A Stock and each share of Company Class B
Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to $36.50, without interest thereon (the "Per
Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit
(and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11);
and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company
as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned
Company Shares") will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of

other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who
shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price
pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that
all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such
demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of
this Section 2.7(c)(ii), "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised
of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to
the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its
counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be afforded
any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the
payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above. 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company RSU_ s. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company RSUs that are unexpired,
unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated as follows.

 

(i) Vested Company RSUs. Each Vested Company RSU shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Vested Company RSU, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "Vested RSU
Consideration").

(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. Each Company RSU that is
unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is not a Vested Company RSU (the "Unvested Company RSUs")
shall be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to (A) the amount of the Per Share Price multiplied
by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cash
Replacement Company RSU Amounts"), which Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts
will, subject to the holders continued service with the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through
the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the
Unvested Company RSUs for which such Cash Replacement RSU Amounts were
exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement
Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including, with
respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific terminations of
employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied to the Unvested Company RSUs
for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative
by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such
other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good
faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of
the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts.

(b) _Company_ _Options_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company Options that are
unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

 

(i) _Vested Options_. Each Vested Company Option shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Company Option, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Price over the applicable per share exercise price under
such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the
"Vested Option Consideration").

 

(ii) _Unvested Options_. Each Company Option that is unexpired,
unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is not a Vested Company Option (the "Unvested Company

 



-16- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Options") shall be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option
multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the
applicable per share exercise price under such Unvested Company Option,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "Cash Replacement Option
Amounts"), which Cash Replacement Option Amounts will, subject to the holders
continued service with the Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, vest
and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which such
Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to
its terms. All Cash Replacement Option Amounts will have the same terms and
conditions (including, with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting
on specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied
to the award of Unvested Company Options for which they were exchanged,
except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial
changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Option
Amounts.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the per share exercise price of
any Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Price, such Company Option shall be cancelled immediately upon
the Effective Time pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ without payment
or consideration.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay on the first
payroll date following thirty days after the Closing Date the aggregate
Vested Option Consideration and Vested RSU Consideration, as applicable, net
of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to each of the
Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs through, to the extent
applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll (subject to any required tax
withholdings) to the applicable holders of such Vested Company Options and
Vested Company RSUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a
holder of Company Options and Company RSUs pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)(i)_, as applicable, cannot be made
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then
the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder,
which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly
following the Closing Date (but in no event later than the first payroll date
following thirty days after the Closing Date).

(d) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to
effect the cancellation and exchange, as applicable, of Company RSUs and
Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act). All Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the
Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Employee Plan or Contract
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company Group will be cancelled as of the Effective Time,
and the Company will take all action necessary to effect the foregoing. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the
Effective Time no participant in any Company Equity Plan or other Employee
Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

(e) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the
Companys 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to
provide that each individual participating in an Offering Period (as defined
in the ESPP) in progress on the date hereof will not be permitted to (i)
increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the
rate in effect as of the date hereof; or (ii) make separate non-payroll
contributions to the ESPP on or following the date hereof, except as may be
required by applicable law. No individual who is not participating in the ESPP
with respect to any current Offering Period as of the date hereof will be
allowed to commence participation in the ESPP following the date hereof. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be necessary
to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Offering
Period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective

 



-17- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Time to terminate no later than five days prior to the date on which the
Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary
to reflect the shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat any shortened
Offering Period as a fully effective and completed Offering Period for all
purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one
Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no
further Offering Period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP
after the date hereof. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the
funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to
and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of
the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

 

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a payment
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Payment Agent. 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent,
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or
fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof
and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity
of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Exchange
Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the
Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of
Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for
any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and
maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund
will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in
any event within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the
"Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by

 



-18- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an
"agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent
will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the
Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price
(such amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit
the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per
Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the
applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be
made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent

 



-19- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the
Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share
Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per
Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or Company
Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.13   _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

2.14 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of
the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
take all such lawful and necessary action.

be, in the aggregate, sufficient to (i) make the payment of all amounts
payable pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger
and (ii) along with the cash on hand at the Company at Closing, pay all fees
and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Equity Financing.

 

(d) _Validity_. As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter (in
the form delivered by Parent to the Company) is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Guarantors, as applicable, enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and the
Guarantors, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations. Other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant
to any agreement relating to the Equity Financing to which the Guarantors,
Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, is a party. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors pursuant to the
Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub are
not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III or the
Companys compliance

 hereunder). As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Equity Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such term or condition
is contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent
and Merger Sub are not making any representation or warranty regarding the
effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III
or the Companys compliance hereunder). As of the date hereof, Parent and
Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or
other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof, in
each case pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter.

(e) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, none of the
Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has
entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any
agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) expressly
prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company Group in connection with the Merger.

 

4.12 _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is a
party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed
or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other
understandings (whether or not binding) with any stockholder (other than any
existing limited partner of the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates),
director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a)
relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as
to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant
to which any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to
receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price
in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock; (ii) such holder
of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against
any Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee
or other Affiliate of the Company other than the Guarantors has agreed to
provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

4.13 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving
effect to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to
Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger and all related
fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries in connection therewith), (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and
such Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of each of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) each of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent
and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due.

(a) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article

respective Affiliates or Representatives as having been authorized by the
Company Group or any of its Affiliates or Representatives (or any other
Person); and

 

(iii) the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
Agreement are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and
warranties, including any express or implied or as to merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose, and the Company hereby disclaims any other
or implied representations or warranties, notwithstanding the delivery

Representatives of any documentation or other information (including any
financial information, supplemental data or financial projections or other
forward-looking statements).

(b) _No Reliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the

to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (B)
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make
such reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions); (D) take or fail to
take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being
considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_
, _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (2) the delivery by the Company to Parent
of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change; or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any positive
material event or development or material change in circumstances with respect
to the Company that was (A) not actually known to, or reasonably expected by,
the Company Board as of the date hereof; and (B) does not relate to (a) any
Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company
meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates
or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics
for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date
hereof in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock
or the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying
cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken
into account) (each such event, an "Intervening Event"), if the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law
and if and only if:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least two
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will
specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company and its Representatives, during such two Business Day period,
must have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) no longer determines that the failure to make a Company
Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening

applicable law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation); or

 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether
during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after

Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent

with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including paying

prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such
Person or "group" of Persons that is in effect on the date of this Agreement);

proposals. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a

to the respective terms of the Capped Call Documentation).

(c) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will

representation letters, authorization letters and undertakings (including
with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and
the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing based on financial information and
data derived from the Companys historical books and records)) that is not
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to
the Effective Time; and (B) any bank information memoranda required in
relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure reflecting the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this
Section 6.6 will require (1) any officer or Representative of the Company
Group to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action under
this Section 6.6 that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such officer or Representative; or (2) the Company Board
to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto, effective prior to the
Closing Date.

(d) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such

Company Group; (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
Company, its business and products or the Merger; and (iii) are used in a
manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company
reasonably imposes.

provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this

Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose

other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as
if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a
beneficiary.

(g) _Indemnification_. The Company Group and its Representatives will be
indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
suffered or incurred by them in connection with any cooperation provided
pursuant to this Section 6.6 or the provision of information utilized in
connection therewith. Parents obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(f) and this
Section 6.6(g) referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

(h) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantors, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will
be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
financing sources or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub
and such investors) enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,

Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company

 Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.

 

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board (and any
committee empowered to take such action, if applicable) will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

6.8   _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company,
except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable law or
regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company Group is a party
or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a
third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such
Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent
to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this
Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company Group or any of its
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company Group
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company Group. Any access to the properties of the Company Group will be
subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be
directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person designated

Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

6.10 _Directors  and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company Group
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between a member of the Company
Group and any of its current or former directors or officers (and any person
who becomes a director or officer of a member of the Company Group prior to
the Effective Time) (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") or employees for
any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Persons or employees occurring
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that
are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement
of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other
similar organizational documents of the

 Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date hereof. During
such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof, each Indemnified Person from
and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or its
Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the Merger, as
well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect
thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if,
at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in
such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal
Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any
such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees
and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an
Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the
Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of
such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent
(unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the
Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with

 



-55- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase
such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all
of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 6.10.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may
not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section
6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were a
Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this
Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii)
the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii)
any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group;
or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Section 6.10 will be joint and several.

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company Group for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant
to such policies or agreements.

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a
"change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the
Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) honor all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance
arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the
Surviving Corporation from in any way amending, modifying or terminating any
such Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.

 

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the
Company Group as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time
until December 31, 2019, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the 

 



-56- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the
benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans and any other employee
benefit plans or other compensation and severance arrangements (other than
equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment
agreements) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Plans") at benefit levels that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on
the date hereof, and provide compensation and benefits (other than equity-
based benefits and subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment
agreements) to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii)
provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based
benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements)
to each Continuing Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based
benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Comparable Plans"); or
(iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that
each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b),
individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity-based benefits and subject to Section 6.11(b),
and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, each of base
compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be
decreased from and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2019 for any
Continuing Employee employed during that period. From and after the Effective
Time until December 31, 2019, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits to eligible
employees in accordance with the Companys severance plans, guidelines and
practices as in effect on the date hereof and that have been made available
to Parent prior to the Closing Date.

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is
made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company Group prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement), except that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Plans) (such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that coverage
pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable
Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability
benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full
credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, co-pay, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time
off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture
and will not limit future accruals (except to the extent that such limits or
forfeitures applied under the Company Plans in effect as of the date hereof).

contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to

of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11,
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that

satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in

Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation but will
not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set
forth above.

Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be

Company Class A Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable

further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

 

6.18 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, will execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent
approving the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

 

6.19 _No Control of the Other Partys Business_. The Parties acknowledge

8.3   _Fees and Expenses_.

Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) at the time of such termination, the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied

 for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will

Parent an amount equal to $57,168,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"). For
purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to "15%" in the definition

then the Company must prior to or concurrently with such termination pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee; _provided_ , that if (A) such termination

into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate an
Acquisition Transaction at the time of such termination, then the "Company
Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $28,584,000.

 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable
pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. 

(d) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof, the Company will pay to Parent
its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the
annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof
was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable law. All payments under this Section 8.3 shall be made by the
Company to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent.

(e) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches under this
Agreement, the Guaranties or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount

all such breaches (the "Parent Liability Limitation"). In no event will any
of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of
their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or
obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary

 Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to
the Debt Financing, nor limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking
to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect
to any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing. Other than the Guarantors obligations under the Guaranties
and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and

or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger.

(ii) Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only monetary damages of Parent and
Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from (A) the
Company Group and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future
holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Company Group and its Affiliates
(the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the
Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with
respect to, and the Company Group may be entitled to remedies with respect to,
the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as
applicable); and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the
Company or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any

hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated
with respect to, and the Company Group may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d),

pursuant to Section 8.3(d)) (the "Company Liability Limitation"). In no event
will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit
any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to

8.6 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. None of the Financing Sources
will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any
of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 8.6
shall limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the
Effective Time under any debt commitment letter or the definitive debt
documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or
its Affiliates are party thereto.

 disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their respective Affiliates; or
(c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for

the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranties; or
(ii) impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially
impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
RSUs and Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC and the Company have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 5, 2018 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), that will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company Group furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
they were parties thereto.

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Guaranties and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will
(a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c)
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance
with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 

9.6 T _hird Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 6.10
and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not,
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as
set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b) if a court of competent
jurisdiction has declined to grant specific performance and has instead
granted an award of damages, then the Company may enforce such award and seek
additional damages on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs and Company Options (which Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors
acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value
or lost premium) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i);
(c) if Parent or Merger Sub wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches this
Agreement, or if the Guarantors wrongfully terminate or willfully breach the
Guaranties, then, following the termination of this Agreement, the Company may
seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company
Options (which Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree may
include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); and (d) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs and Company Options to receive the merger consideration set forth
in Article II. The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) and clause (c) of
the second sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company
Options by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for
such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in
such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company
RSUs or Company Options and subsequently transfer therewith and,
consequently,

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the
Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company
in connection therewith and subject to the limitations set forth in Section
8.3(e)(i)) may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A)
distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any
date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use
and benefit of the Company in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.4, Section 8.6, Section
9.3, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and this Section
9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors
and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof
(it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns).

 9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no
circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing
and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance).

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section
8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish
or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to
enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter
in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the
rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any Debt Financing
under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its Affiliates and their
direct and indirect equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source, solely in
their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the

 



-69- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Debt Financing, and in no event shall the Company, any of its Affiliates or
its or their direct or indirect equityholders be entitled to directly seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any Financing
Source.

(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B)
the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents
to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guaranties, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2
or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in
this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court within the State of Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the event that
any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranties or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in
the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such
Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead
or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal
Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Merger, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and
any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of
process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTIES, THE EQUITY
COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY
SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.11.

 

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

9.13 _Counterparts._ This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot
be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be
cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing
condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent
effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed
to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.
