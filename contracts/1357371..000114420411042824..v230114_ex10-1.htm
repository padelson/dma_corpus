ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 26, 2011,
is by and between CABOT OIL and GAS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Seller"), and BREITBURN OPERATING L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
("Buyer").

  

  

WHEREAS, Seller owns certain oil and gas properties and related assets located
in the States of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
Seller, such oil and gas properties and related assets upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

  

  

Section 1.1 Certain Defined Terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, the
respective terms defined in Appendix A attached hereto and incorporated herein
shall, when used herein, have the respective meanings therein specified, with
each such definition to be equally applicable both to the singular and the
plural forms of the term so defined.

  

  

Section 1.2 Rules of Construction.

  

  

(a) All article, section, schedule and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, schedules and exhibits to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. The schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for
all purposes.

  

  

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the plural,
and vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires
otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neutral genders and vice versa. The term "includes" or "including" shall mean
"including without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
section or article in which such words appear.

  

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that each Party and its attorneys have reviewed
this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party, or any similar rule
operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable to the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 1 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Any event hereunder requiring the payment of cash or cash equivalents and
any action to be taken hereunder on a day that is not a Business Day shall be
deferred until the first Business Day occurring after such day.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

SALE AND PURCHASE

  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell
and convey to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller, the Assets.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

  

  

Section 3.1 Consideration. The consideration for the sale and conveyance of
the Assets to Buyer is TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($285,000,000.00), as adjusted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(the "Purchase Price"). The "Adjusted Purchase Price" shall be the Purchase
Price (i) as adjusted by the Initial Adjustment Amount, (ii) as adjusted for
Title Defects, if any, in accordance with Section 6.2, (iii) as may be
adjusted for excluded Title Defect Properties, if any, in accordance with
Section 6.5(a), (iv) as may be adjusted for undisclosed gas imbalances, if
any, pursuant to Section 3.5, (v) as may be adjusted for payments of portions
of the Purchase Price received by Seller from holders of Preference Rights
contemporaneously with Closing in accordance with and as contemplated by
Section 7.2, (vi) as may be adjusted on account of Retained Assets as
contemplated by Section 7.3, (vii) as adjusted downward by an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of proceeds which Seller is holding in suspense as of the
Effective Time in respect of past production of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons
attributable to the Assets (viii) as may be adjusted with respect to wells
listed on Schedule 4.1(j) (the "PandA Wells") pursuant to Section 3.6, and (ix)
as adjusted downward by an amount equal to $1,838,125.00 for certain gas
imbalances and other matters (with the adjustments described in subsections
(i) through (ix) above, collectively the "Purchase Price Adjustments").

  

  

Section 3.2 Payment. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer has deposited an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price
with Seller as a deposit hereunder (the "Deposit"). At the Closing, Buyer
shall wire transfer the Adjusted Purchase Price minus the Deposit in
immediately available funds to JP Morgan Chase Bank, ABA No. 021-000-021 for
the account of Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation, Account No. 636462608, or such
other account specified by Seller to Buyer on or prior to the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 2 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 3.3 Adjustments.

  

  

(a) The Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by
an amount equal to the Net Cash Flow with respect to the Assets for the time
period (the "Adjustment Period") beginning at the Effective Time and ending at
7:00 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date. Seller shall deliver to Buyer on
or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date a statement (the "Adjustment Statement") setting forth the Purchase Price
Adjustments which shall include Seller's preliminary determination as of such
date of the Net Cash Flow (such preliminary determination of the Net Cash Flow
being the "Initial Adjustment Amount") and Seller's preliminary determination
of the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustments contemplated by subsections
(iv) and (vii) of the definition of Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Initial
Other Amounts"). If the Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the Adjustment
Statement is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by
such amount. If the Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the Adjustment
Statement is a negative number, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by
such amount.

  

  

(b) The Initial Adjustment Amount and the Initial Other Amounts set forth on
the Adjustment Statement shall be based upon actual information available to
Seller at the time of its preparation and upon Seller's good faith estimates
and assumptions. There shall be attached to the Adjustment Statement such
supporting documentation and other data as is reasonably necessary to provide
a basis for the Purchase Price Adjustments (including Net Cash Flow) shown
therein.

  

  

(c) The "Net Cash Flow" shall be the algebraic sum of (i) a positive amount
equal to the aggregate amount paid by Seller as Seller's share of the costs
and expenses of exploration, maintenance, development, production and
operation of the Assets incurred with respect to the Adjustment Period
(including prepayments of any such costs or expenses but excluding any costs
and expenses paid by Seller during the Adjustment Period with respect to the
plugging and abandonment of any of the PandA Wells and any costs and expenses
relating to the purchase of the Inventory), (ii) a positive amount equal to
the sum of (A) all overhead charges paid by Seller to any operator of any of
the Assets, and (B) with respect to any properties operated by Seller or any
affiliate of Seller, the overhead charges payable to Seller or such affiliated
operator on account of the Subject Interests in such properties under existing
operating agreements or, if no overhead charge is applicable to a Subject
Interest under an existing operating agreement, an overhead charge to such
Subject Interest equal to $4,500 per month for each drilling well and $1,000
per month for each producing well attributable to each such Subject Interest,
and (iii) a negative amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds received by
Seller from the sale or disposition of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons
produced from the Assets during the Adjustment Period or from the rental,
sale, salvage or other disposition of any other Assets during the Adjustment
Period.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 3 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 3.4 Post Closing Review. After the Closing, Seller shall review the
Adjustment Statement and determine the actual Purchase Price Adjustments
contemplated by subsections (iv) and (vii) of the definition of Adjusted
Purchase Price and the actual Net Cash Flow. On or prior to the ninetieth
(90th) day after the Closing Date, Seller shall present Buyer with a statement
of the actual Purchase Price Adjustments contemplated by subsections (iv) and
(vii) of the definition of Adjusted Purchase Price and the actual Net Cash
Flow and such supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to support
the same (the "Final Adjustment Statement"). Buyer will give representatives
of Seller reasonable access to its premises and to its books and records for
purposes of preparing the Final Adjustment Statement and will cause
appropriate personnel of Buyer to assist Seller and Seller's representatives,
at no cost to Seller, in the preparation of the Final Adjustment Statement.
Seller will give representatives of Buyer reasonable access to its premises
and to its books and records for purposes of reviewing the calculation of
Purchase Price Adjustments reflected in the Final Adjustment Statement and
will cause appropriate personnel of Seller to assist Buyer and its
representatives, at no cost to Buyer, in verification of such calculation. The
Final Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding on Seller and Buyer
as to the Net Cash Flow and, without limiting Buyer's rights pursuant to
Section 3.5, the other Purchase Price Adjustments reflected therein, thirty
(30) days following the date the Final Adjustment Statement is received by
Buyer, except to the extent that prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)
day period Buyer delivers to Seller notice, as hereinafter required, of its
disagreement with the contents of the Final Adjustment Statement. Such notice
shall be in writing and set forth all of Buyer's disagreements with respect to
any portion of the Final Adjustment Statement, together with Buyer's proposed
changes thereto, and shall include an explanation in reasonable detail of, and
such supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to support, such
changes. If Buyer has timely delivered such a notice of disagreement to
Seller, then, upon written agreement between Buyer and Seller resolving all
disagreements of Buyer set forth in such notice, the Final Adjustment
Statement will become final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Net
Cash Flow and, without limiting Buyer's rights pursuant to Section 3.5, the
other Purchase Price Adjustments reflected therein. If the Final Adjustment
Statement has not become final and binding by the sixtieth (60th) day
following its receipt by Buyer, then Buyer or Seller may submit any unresolved
disagreements of Buyer set forth in such notice to final and binding
arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures. Upon resolution of
such unresolved disagreements of Buyer, the Final Adjustment Statement shall
be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Net Cash Flow and,
without limiting Buyer's rights pursuant to Section 3.5, any other Purchase
Price Adjustments reflected therein. Within three (3) Business Days after the
Final Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding as to the Net Cash Flow
and, without limiting Buyer's rights pursuant to Section 3.5, the other
Purchase Price Adjustments reflected therein, Seller or Buyer, as appropriate,
shall pay to the other Party the amount, if any, by which the actual Purchase
Price Adjustments shown in the Final Adjustment Statement, are less than or
exceed the sum of the Initial Adjustment Amount and the Initial Other Amounts,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until paid at the Agreed
Rate. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, Seller shall
not be liable to pay to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.4 any amounts on
account of Net Cash Flow that have been paid by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
the Transition Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.5 Gas Imbalance Adjustments. The Purchase Price shall be (a) reduced
by an amount equal to (1) Unscheduled (Negative) Imbalances multiplied by (2)
$3.12 per Mcf and (b) increased by an amount equal to (1) Unscheduled
(Positive) Imbalances multiplied by (2) $3.12 per Mcf.

  

  

Section 3.6 PandA Wells. With respect to any of the PandA Wells that (a) have not
been plugged and abandoned by the Closing (or Seller's share of the cost for
which has not been paid by Seller by Closing) or (b) Seller has not, prior to
the Closing, prepaid Seller's share of the plugging and abandonment costs of
such well to the operator conducting such plugging and abandonment operation,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the plugging and abandonment costs set
forth on Schedule 4.1(j) for such PandA Well.

title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files, assignments,
division orders, and similar documents and (y) all environmental reports,
assessments and audits, in each case, relating to the Assets insofar as the
same are in Seller's possession and insofar as Seller may do so without (a)
violating legal constraints or any legal obligation (provided that, in the
case of confidentiality obligations, Seller has used commercially reasonable

attorney/client privilege (such limitations described in clauses (a) and (b)
being herein collectively called the "Limitations"), (ii) subject to any

ARTICLE VI

  

TITLE ADJUSTMENTS

  

  

Section 6.1 No Warranty or Representation. Without limiting Buyer's right to
adjust the Purchase Price by operation of Sections 6.2 and 6.5(a) and except
for the special warranty of title which is contained in the Conveyance, Seller
makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
with respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided above, Buyer's sole remedy
for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of
the Assets shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article VI,
which remedies (other than those provided for in Section 6.5) shall, subject
to Section 6.6, cease and be deemed to be finally and conclusively satisfied,

representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of the information, records and data now, heretofore
or hereafter made available to Buyer in connection with this Agreement

other matters contained in or related to the Reserve Report or any other
material furnished to Buyer by Seller or by Seller's agents or
representatives).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 10 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 6.2 Buyer's Title Review.

  

  

(a) Buyer's Assertion of Title Defects. Prior to the expiration of the sixty
(60) day period commencing on the execution of this Agreement (the "Title
Examination Period"), Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any matters
which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer
intends to assert as a Title Defect with respect to any portion of a Property
Subdivision pursuant to this Article VI. For all purposes of this Agreement,
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Title Defect which Buyer fails to
assert as a Title Defect by written notice given to Seller on or before the
expiration of the Title Examination Period. To be effective, Buyer's written
notice of a Title Defect must include (i) a brief description of the matter
constituting the asserted Title Defect, (ii) the claimed Title Defect Amount
attributable thereto, and (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify
the existence of such asserted Title Defect. To give Seller an opportunity to
commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to give Seller
written notice of any Title Defect which Buyer determines exists promptly
following Buyer's determination of the existence of same, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the end of the Title
Examination Period. Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written
notice of any Seller Title Credit which is discovered by any of Buyer's
employees or representatives while conducting Buyer's title review, due
diligence or investigation with respect to the Subject Interests and Property
Subdivisions.

  

  

(b) Purchase Price Allocations. The Purchase Price has been allocated to the
various Subject Interests in Property Subdivisions in the manner and in
accordance with the respective values set forth in Part II of the Property
Schedule. If any adjustment is made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 6.2, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the affected Property Subdivision in the Property
Schedule.

  

  

(c) Seller's Opportunity to Cure. Seller shall have until two (2) days prior
to the Closing Date, at its cost and expense, if it so elects but without
obligation, to cure all or a portion of such asserted Title Defects. Any
asserted Title Defects which are waived by Buyer or cured within such time
shall be deemed "Permitted Encumbrances" hereunder. If Seller within such time
fails to cure any Title Defect of which Buyer has given timely written notice
as required above and Buyer has not and does not waive same on or before the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Property Subdivision affected
by such uncured and unwaived Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property".

  

  

(d) Buyer's Title Adjustments. Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6, as Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to Title Defects (other than as set
forth in the Conveyance), Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the Purchase Price
by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts
with respect to all Title Defect Properties exceeds the sum of $7,000,000 (the
"Title Defect Deductible") plus the aggregate amount of Seller Title Credits
with respect to all Property Subdivisions. As used herein, the term "Title
Defect Amount" shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the amount
by which the value of such Title Defect Property is impaired as a result of
the existence of one or more uncured and unwaived Title Defects, which amount
shall be determined as follows:

  

  

(1) If the Title Defect results from Seller having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in the Net Revenue
Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified
for such Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 11 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(2) If the Title Defect results from Seller having a greater Working Interest
in a Title Defect Property than the Working Interest specified therefor in
Part II of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to
the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the increase in
the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with respect to such
Title Defect Property for the period from and after the Effective Time which
is attributable to such increase in Seller's Working Interest; provided,
however, that no Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to the
extent that an increase in Seller's Working Interest in a Property Subdivision
has the effect of proportionately increasing Seller's Net Revenue Interest in
such Property Subdivision.

  

  

(3) If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien, the Title Defect
Amount shall be an amount sufficient to discharge such lien.

  

  

(4) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(1), (2) or (3) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the
difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such
Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect
Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated in Part II of the Property Schedule to such Title
Defect Property); provided that, if such Title Defect is reasonably
susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than
the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect.

  

  

(5) If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect
Property throughout the entire productive life of such Title Defect Property,
such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.

  

  

(6) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a lien
affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect
to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the
curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect
Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense
of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect Amount for
one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect Amount.

  

  

(7) If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision (as
contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Property
Subdivision) and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated
specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in the Property
Schedule, then for purposes of computing the Title Defect Amount, the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision shall be further
allocated among the portions of such Property Subdivision in the proportion
that the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) of such Property
Subdivision affected by such Title Defect bears to the net acreage (or net
acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property Subdivision. In the event
such Property Subdivision is subject to a unitization agreement, the foregoing
allocation shall be made in a manner which is consistent with the allocation
of production or productive acreage in such unitization agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 12 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(8) The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or any
portion thereof shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such Title Defect Property or such portion in Section 6.2(b) and paragraph
(7) above. For example, but without limitation, if Seller does not own fifty
percent (50%) of the Net Revenue Interest specified in the Property Schedule
for a Title Defect Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest is
also burdened by a lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect
Property shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such
fifty percent (50%) interest notwithstanding that it may be affected by
multiple Title Defects.

  

  

(9) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to the foregoing with respect to a Title Defect Property is
$20,000.00 or less, then the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title
Defect Property shall be deemed to be zero.

  

  

Section 6.3 Determination of Title Defects. A portion of a Property
Subdivision shall be deemed to have a "Title Defect" if Seller does not have
Defensible Title thereto as of the execution date hereof and as of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the following matters shall not constitute Title Defects: (a) defects arising
out of lack of corporate authorization, unless Buyer provides affirmative
evidence that such corporate action was not authorized and results in another
Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or
portion thereof; (b) defects in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1950,
unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that the defect results in another
Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or
portion thereof; and (c) defects relating to matters for which the applicable
statute of limitations has expired.

  

  

Section 6.4 Seller Title Credit. A "Seller Title Credit" shall mean, with
respect to a Property Subdivision, the amount by which the value of such
Property Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of (a) Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue specified
therefor in Part II of the Property Schedule, or (b) Seller having a lesser
Working Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Working Interest
specified therefor in Part II of the Property Schedule, which amount shall be
determined as follows:

  

  

(1) If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest
specified therefor in Part II of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title
Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part II of the
Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the
Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II of the Property Schedule.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 13 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(2) If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a lesser Working
Interest in a Property Subdivision than the Working Interest specified
therefor in Part II of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be
equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the
decrease in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with
respect to such Property Subdivision for the period from and after the
Effective Time which is attributable to such decrease in Seller's Working
Interest; provided, however, no Seller Title Credit shall be allowed on
account of and to the extent that a decrease in Seller's Working Interest in a
Property Subdivision has the effect of proportionately decreasing Seller's Net
Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision.

  

  

(3) In determining the amount of Seller Title Credits, the principles and
methodology set forth in paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) of Section 6.2(d) shall
be applied, mutatis mutandis.

  

  

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

if the amount of a Seller Title Credit determined pursuant to the foregoing
with respect to a Property Subdivision is $20,000.00 or less, then the amount
of such Seller Title Credit shall be deemed to be zero; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

there shall be no increase to the Title Defect Deductible for Seller Title
Credits which would otherwise generate an increase to the Title Defect
Deductible unless and until the aggregate amount of such Seller Title Credits
exceeds $7,000,000, and then only to the extent that such aggregate amount
exceeds such amount.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

The Title Defect Deductible shall be restored to the extent that any portion
thereof is applied as a credit against a Title Defect Amount attributable to a
Title Defect which is subsequently cured by Seller or determined not to
constitute a Title Defect.

  

  

Section 6.5 Exclusion of Title Defect Properties; Indemnification. On or
before the Closing Date, Seller may with respect to any Title Defect Property,
(a) elect to retain and exclude such Title Defect Property from the Assets to
be conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof so long as the
Purchase Price is reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated (or
deemed allocated pursuant to Section 6.2(d)(7)) to such Title Defect Property
in Part II of the Property Schedule, or (b) indemnify Buyer, in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, from and against all liabilities,
losses, costs and expenses resulting from each Title Defect affecting such
Title Defect Property which do not exceed, in the aggregate, the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property in Part II of the
Property Schedule. In the event Seller exercises its right under Section
6.5(a) with respect to a Title Defect Property, said Title Defect Property,
together with a pro rata share of all incidental rights, oil, gas and other
hydrocarbons and other assets attributable or appurtenant thereto, shall be
retained by Seller and excluded from the Assets which are conveyed by Seller
to Buyer pursuant to the Conveyance. In the event Seller exercises its right
under Section 6.5(b) with respect to a Title Defect Property, the Purchase
Price shall not be reduced on account of any Title Defect affecting such Title
Defect Property.

Section 6.6 Deferred Claims and Disputes. In the event that Buyer and Seller
have not agreed upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by
Buyer or Seller pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this
Article VI, any such claim (a "Deferred Adjustment Claim") shall be settled
pursuant to this Section 6.6 and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and
9.2(e), shall not prevent or delay Closing. With respect to each potential
Deferred Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other a
written notice describing each such potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, the
amount in dispute and a statement setting forth the facts and circumstances
that support such Party's position with respect to such Deferred Adjustment
Claim. At Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on account of,
and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.2(e), no effect shall be
given to, the Deferred Adjustment Claim. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th)
consecutive calendar day following the Closing Date (the "Deferred Matters
Date"), Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the
Deferred Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve by written agreement
all disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment Claims. Any Deferred Adjustment
Claims which are not so resolved on or before the Deferred Matters Date shall
be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration Procedures; provided, however, that Seller may elect at any time
to resolve all disputes relating to the Deferred Adjustment Claims by the
payment to Buyer of the amount by which the Purchase Price would have been
reduced at Closing on account of the Title Defects which constitute Deferred
Adjustment Claims if same did not constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims.
Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, including Section
6.2(c), Seller shall be entitled to cure any Title Defect which constitutes a
Deferred Adjustment Claim at any time prior to the point in time when a final
and binding written decision of the board of arbitrators is made with respect
thereto in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures. The amount of any
reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer becomes entitled under the
final and binding written decision of the board of arbitrators shall be
promptly refunded by Seller to Buyer.

  

  

Section 6.7 No Duplication. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if a Title Defect results from any matter which could also result in
the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Section
4.1, then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title Defect
pursuant to this Article VI and shall be precluded from also asserting such
matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

PREFERENCE RIGHTS AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS

  

  

Section 7.1 Compliance. Buyer's purchase of the Assets is expressly subject to
all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements. Promptly following the execution hereof, Seller shall initiate
all procedures required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preference
Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth on Schedule 7.1 with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall not be obligated to
pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) the
holder of any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement in order to obtain the
waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 15 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 7.2 Effect of Preference Rights. If a third party who has been offered
a Preference Property pursuant to Section 7.1 elects prior to Closing to
purchase such Preference Property in accordance with the terms of such
Preference Right, and Seller receives written notice of such election prior to
the Closing Date, such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Assets
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Preference Property pursuant to the immediately following
sentence. The portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to any Asset or
portion thereof affected by a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") shall
be the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto in Part II of the
Property Schedule. If a Preference Right affects only a portion of a Property
Subdivision and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated
specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in Part II of the
Property Schedule, then the portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to
such Preference Property shall be determined in the same manner as provided in
Section 6.2(d)(7) when a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property
Subdivision. If a third party who has been offered a Preference Property or
who has been requested to waive its Preference Right pursuant to Section 7.1
does not elect to purchase such Preference Property or waive such Preference
Right with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to
the Closing Date, such Preference Property shall be conveyed to Buyer at
Closing subject to such Preference Right, unless such Preference Property has
been otherwise eliminated from the Assets in accordance with other provisions
of this Agreement. If a third party elects to purchase a Preference Property
subject to a Preference Right and Closing has already occurred with respect to
such Preference Property, Buyer shall be obligated to convey said Preference
Property to such third party and shall be entitled to the consideration for
the sale of such Preference Property.

  

  

Section 7.3 Transfer Requirements. If a Transfer Requirement applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not obtained, complied with or
otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date, then, unless otherwise mutually
agreed by Seller and Buyer, any Asset or portion thereof affected by such
Transfer Requirement (a "Retained Asset") shall be held back from the Assets
to be transferred and conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price to
be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price which
would be allocated to such Retained Asset pursuant to Section 7.2 if such
Retained Asset were a Preference Property. Any Retained Asset so held back at
the initial Closing will be conveyed to Buyer within ten (10) days following
the date on which Seller obtains, complies with or otherwise satisfies all
Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset for a purchase price
equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account of the
holding back of such Retained Asset; provided, however, if all Transfer
Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the initial
Closing are not obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied within one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date, then such Retained Asset
shall be eliminated from the Assets and this Agreement unless Seller and Buyer
mutually agree to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset in which case
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any objection with respect to non-
compliance with such Transfer Requirements. In connection with any subsequent
conveyance of a Retained Asset, appropriate adjustments for Net Cash Flow
attributable to such Retained Asset will be made to account for any delayed
Closing with respect to such Retained Asset.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 7.4 Certain Governmental Consents. Seller and Buyer will use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts before and after Closing, as
appropriate, to obtain all approvals and consents from the United States
Department of Interior and the applicable state or Indian agencies or
authorities that may be required under the terms of (or regulations
specifically applicable to) any federal, state or Indian leases in connection
with the assignment of the Subject Interests therein from Seller to Buyer.
Following the Closing, until such approvals and consents are obtained, Seller
shall continue to hold legal title to such Subject Interests as nominee for
Buyer. Seller shall not be obligated or authorized to incur any costs or
expenses in Seller's capacity as nominee. For purposes of Article XIII, Seller
and Buyer shall treat and deal with such Subject Interests as if full legal
and equitable title to such Subject Interests had passed from Seller to Buyer
at Closing.

  

  

Section 7.5 Express Conditions on Sale. Buyer acknowledges that Seller desires
to sell all of the Assets and would not have entered into this Agreement but
for Buyer's agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided.
Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller does not desire
to sell any Preference Property unless the sale of all of the Assets is
consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller's obligation hereunder to
sell the Preference Properties to Buyer is expressly conditioned upon the
consummation by the Closing Date of the sale of all of the Assets in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by conveyance to Buyer or
conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preference Right; provided that, nothing
herein is intended or shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to
any portion of the Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of
the essence with respect to the Parties' agreement to consummate the sale of
the Assets by the Closing Date.

agrees that:

  

  

(a) Sales. Seller shall not sell, transfer, assign, convey, farmout, release,

construction, maintenance, development, production or operation of the Assets
or the production or processing of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons therefrom
pursuant to or in accordance with this Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, in each
case, to the extent arising in the ordinary course of business and that are
not delinquent and that will be paid in the ordinary course of business or, if
delinquent, that are being contested in good faith, or (ii) required or
evidenced by the Subject Interests, joint operating agreements or unitization
or pooling agreements relating to or included in the Assets, or required or
evidenced by any other contract or agreement included in the Assets, to the
extent securing amounts or obligations arising in the ordinary course of
business and that are not delinquent and that will be paid or performed in the
ordinary course of business, or, if delinquent, that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate actions.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 17 -

business, in accordance with Seller's past practices, in compliance, in all
material respects, with Law and, subject to the exceptions set forth in clause
(iii) below, the terms of the Subject Interests, maintain insurance now in
force with respect to the Assets, and pay or cause to be paid all costs and
expenses in connection therewith promptly when due;

  

  

(ii) not commit to participate in the drilling of any new well or other new
operations on the Assets the cost of which (net to Seller's interest) is in
excess of $500,000.00 in any single instance, without the advance written
consent of Buyer, which consent or non-consent must be given by Buyer within
the lesser of (x) ten (10) days of Buyer's receipt of the notice from Seller
or (y) one-half (½) of the applicable notice period within which Seller is
contractually obligated to respond to third parties to avoid a deemed election
by Seller regarding such operation, as specified in Seller's notice to Buyer
requesting such consent; provided that, failure by Buyer to respond within the
aforesaid applicable period shall constitute Buyer's consent to Seller's
participation in such well or other operation;

  

  

(iii) maintain and keep the Assets in full force and effect, except where such
failure is due to (i) the failure to pay a delay rental, royalty, shut in
royalty or other payment by mistake or oversight (including Seller's
negligence) unless caused by Seller's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
or (ii) the failure to participate in an operation which Buyer does not timely
approve; and

  

  

(iv) use Seller's commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its
relationships with suppliers, customers and others having material business
relations with Seller with respect to the Assets so that they will be
preserved for Buyer on and after the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Contracts and Agreements. Seller shall not:

  

  

(i) grant or create any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement with respect
to the Assets except in connection with the performance by Seller of an
obligation or agreement existing on the date hereof or pursuant to this

(iv) voluntarily terminate, amend, transfer, execute or extend any Material

outside the ordinary course of business; or

  

  

(v) enter into agreements with respect to any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 8.2 Qualifications on Seller's Conduct.

  

  

(a) Emergencies; Legal Requirements. Seller may take (or not take, as the case
may be) any of the actions mentioned in Section 8.1 above if reasonably
necessary under emergency circumstances (or if required or prohibited (as the
case may be) pursuant to Law) and provided Buyer is notified as soon
thereafter as practicable.

  

  

(b) Non-Operated Properties. If Seller is not the operator of a particular
portion of the Assets, the obligations of Seller in Section 8.1 above with
respect to such portion of the Assets, which have reference to operations or
activities which pursuant to existing contracts are carried out or performed
by the operator, shall be construed to require only that Seller use
commercially reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense
(unless Buyer has agreed to reimburse Seller therefor) or institute any cause
of action) to cause the operator of such portion of the Assets to take such
actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable
operating agreements and other applicable agreements.

  

  

(c) Certain Operations. Should Seller not wish to pay any lease rental or
other payment or participate in any reworking, deepening, drilling,
completion, equipping or other operation on or with respect to any well or
other Property Subdivision which may otherwise be required by Section 8.1
above, Seller shall give Buyer written notice thereof at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date such rental or other payment is due or, in the case of
an operation, promptly after Seller receives notice of such proposed operation
from the operator of such property (or if Seller is the operator, at the same
time Seller gives or is required to give notice of such proposed operation to
the non-operators of such property); and Seller shall not be obligated to make
any such payment or to elect to participate in any such operation which Seller
does not wish to make or participate in unless Seller receives from Buyer,
within a reasonable time prior to the date when such payment or election is
required to be made by Seller, the written election and agreement of Buyer (i)
to require Seller to take such action and (ii) to pay all costs and expenses
of Seller with respect to such lease rental or other payment or such
operation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be obligated to pay
any lease rental or other payment or to elect to participate in any operation
if the operator of the property involved recommends that such action not be
taken. If Buyer advances any funds pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) with
respect to a particular portion of the Assets, such portion of the Assets is
not conveyed to Buyer at Closing or Closing does not occur, and such funds are
not reimbursed to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the earlier of Closing
or termination of this Agreement, then, with respect to such particular
portion of the Assets, (i) Buyer shall own and be entitled to any interest of
Seller that would have lapsed but for such payment or (ii) in the case of
operations, Buyer shall be entitled to receive the penalty, if any, that
Seller, as nonconsenting party, would have suffered under the applicable
operating or other agreement with respect to such operations as if Buyer were
a consenting party thereunder; in each case, subject to and after deduction of
any damages or other relief to which Seller may be entitled with respect to
any breach by Buyer of this Agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 19 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 8.3 Conveyance. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall execute and
deliver or cause the execution and delivery of the General Conveyance, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.3 (the "Conveyance"),
together with all special federal, state and tribal assignment forms as may be
required by Law to be executed in connection with the conveyance of specific
Assets; provided that, the terms and provisions of the Conveyance shall
control as to any conflict between the Conveyance and any such special
assignment forms.

  

  

Section 8.4 Public Announcements. If a Party intends to issue, or permit any
agent or affiliate of it to issue, any press releases or otherwise make, or
cause any agent or affiliate of it to make, any public statements with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, such Party shall
deliver to the other Party a copy of any such press release or public
statement not less than one (1) Business Day before such Party (or its
affiliate or agent) issues or makes such press release or public statement.

  

  

Section 8.5 Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer each agrees that, from time
to time, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver
or cause their respective affiliates to execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other action as may be
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement. Any
separate or additional assignment of the Assets or any portion thereof
required pursuant to this Section 8.5 (i) shall evidence the conveyance and
assignment of the Assets made or intended to be made in the Conveyance, (ii)
shall not modify or be deemed to modify any of the terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Conveyance, and (iii) shall be deemed to contain
all of the terms and provisions of the Conveyance, as fully as though the same
were set forth at length in such separate or additional assignment.

  

  

Section 8.6 Removal. Buyer shall have no right to use the name or mark of
Seller or any of its affiliates (or any variation or derivative thereof) or
the logos relating thereto and, as promptly as practicable, but in any case
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall remove the name
and mark of Seller and any of its affiliates and any variations and
derivatives thereof and logos relating thereto from the Assets. Because
damages would be an inadequate remedy, the Parties agree that Seller shall be
entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for
any breach by Buyer of this Section 8.6.

  

  

Section 8.7 Records. Within a reasonable period of time following the Closing,
Seller shall make all Records available for delivery to Buyer in Houston,
Texas. Buyer agrees to maintain the Records that are acquired pursuant to this
Agreement until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such
longer period of time as Seller shall advise Buyer is necessary in order to
have Records available with respect to open years for Tax audit purposes), or,
if any of such Records pertain to any claim or dispute pending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of such
Records designated by Seller until such claim or dispute is finally resolved
and the time for all appeals has been exhausted. Buyer shall provide Seller
and its representatives reasonable access to and the right to copy such
Records for the purposes of (i) preparing and delivering any accounting
provided for under this Agreement and adjusting, prorating and settling the
charges and credits provided for in this Agreement, (ii) complying with any
Law affecting Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
preparing any audit of the books and records of any third party relating to
Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date, or responding to
any audit prepared by such third parties, (iv) preparing Tax Returns, (v)

otherwise dealing with any claim or dispute under this Agreement or with
respect to the Assets. In no event shall Buyer destroy any such Records
without giving Seller sixty (60) days' advance written notice thereof and the
opportunity, at Seller's expense, to obtain such Records prior to their
destruction.

any non-material matter relating to Seller or the Assets which relates to an
event that first occurs after the date of this Agreement and does not result
from a breach by Seller of Section 8.1, or (b) any matter which relates to a
property excluded from the Assets pursuant to Section 6.5(a).

  

  

Section 8.9 Recording. Immediately following the Closing, Buyer, at its cost
and expense, shall record the Conveyance and all other instruments of
assignment in the appropriate governmental offices of the jurisdictions in
which the Assets are located and in any other locations and records in which
recordation is required or advisable. Promptly following such recording, Buyer
shall advise Seller in writing of the pertinent recording data.

  

  

Section 8.10 Casualty and Condemnation. If after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets shall be destroyed or damaged
by fire or other casualty or if any part of the Assets shall be taken in
condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or if proceedings for such
purposes shall be pending or threatened, this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding any such destruction, damage, taking or
proceeding or the threat thereof. To the extent insurance proceeds,
condemnation awards or other payments are not committed, used or applied by
Seller prior to the Closing Date to repair, restore or replace such destroyed,
damaged or taken Assets, Seller shall at the Closing (a) assign to Buyer
Seller's right to receive all insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or
payments owed to Seller by reason of such destruction or taking, less any
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in collecting same or in
connection with such proceedings or the threat thereof, and (b) pay to Buyer
all insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or payments theretofore paid to
Seller by reason of such destruction, damage or taking, less any reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Seller in collecting same or in connection with
such proceedings or the threat thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or payments (or any rights thereto)
by reason of such destruction, damage or taking which are held by or owed to
Seller for the account or benefit of any third party joint interest owners
shall not be paid or assigned by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Section and
shall instead be transferred to the successor operator or other Person
responsible therefor pursuant to the terms of the applicable operating or
other agreement.

  

  

Section 8.11 Transition Agreement. At Closing, Seller and Buyer shall execute
and deliver a Transition Services Agreement (the "Transition Agreement")

Section 8.12 Key Employee. Buyer shall have the right, at any time, to solicit
and make an offer of employment (as an employee, contractor or consultant)
that is conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing to the individual listed
on Schedule 8.12, providing for a salary and benefits that are no less
favorable than such individual's current salary and benefits (the "Key
Employee," and such offer, the "Employment Offer"). No such offer of
employment shall become effective unless and until the Closing occurs. Seller
shall not directly or indirectly make an offer of employment or relocation (in
each case, as either an employee, consultant or contractor) to the Key
Employee (or solicit the Key Employee for employment or relocation); and shall
not act, in any way, to restrict Buyer from making, or deter the Key Employee
from accepting, the Employment Offer. Except with respect to the Key Employee,
Buyer shall not make any solicitations or offers of employment to any employee
of Seller or its affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller. This
Section 8.12 shall not restrict, and shall not be deemed to restrict, Buyer
from making any solicitations or offers of employment to the Key Employee or
any consultant or adviser of Seller.

action relating to the filing of any Property Tax Tax Return or the payment of
any Property Tax, in each case, if such election, adoption, change, amendment,
agreement, filing, settlement, surrender, consent, or other action would have
the effect of increasing the Property Tax liability for any of the Assets for
any period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date.

LIMITATIONS

  

  

Section 12.1 Disclaimer of Warranties. Notwithstanding anything contained to
the contrary in any other provision of this Agreement, it is the explicit
intent of each Party that Seller is not making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, beyond those
representations and warranties expressly given in this Agreement and the
Conveyance, and it is understood that, without limiting such express
representations and warranties, Buyer is taking the Assets as is and where is
and with all faults. Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, except for those representations and warranties expressly
given in this Agreement and the Conveyance, Seller hereby: (a) expressly
disclaims and negates any representation or warranty, express or implied, at
common law, by statute or otherwise, relating to (i) the condition of the
Assets (including any implied or express warranty of merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose, or of conformity to models or samples of
materials, or the presence or absence of any hazardous materials in or on, or
disposed of or discharged from, the Assets) or (ii) any infringement by Seller
or any of its affiliates of any patent or proprietary right of any third
party; and (b) negates any rights of Buyer under statutes to claim diminution
of consideration and any claims by Buyer for damages because of defects,
whether known or unknown, it being the intention of Seller and Buyer that the
Assets are to be accepted by Buyer in their present condition and state of
repair.

  

  

Section 12.2 Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act Waiver. Buyer (a) represents
and warrants to Seller that it (i) is acquiring the Assets for commercial or
business use, (ii) is represented by legal counsel, (iii) acknowledges the
consideration paid or to be paid for the Assets will exceed $500,000, and (iv)
has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that
enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position
with respect to Seller; and (b) hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
any and all rights or remedies it may have under the Deceptive Trade Practices
- Consumer Protection Act of the state of Texas, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code § 17.41
et seq. to the maximum extent it can do so under Law, if such act would for
any reason be deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

WAIVER OF CONSUMER RIGHTS

  

  

BUYER WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES - CONSUMER
PROTECTION ACT, SECTION 17.41 ET SEQ., BUSINESS and COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT
GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN
ATTORNEY OF BUYER'S OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER.

  

  

Furthermore, Buyer waives any comparable provision of the Law of the state or
other jurisdiction where any portion of the Assets is located or to which the
Assets are subject.

Section 12.3 Damages. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in
any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer agree that, except for
the liquidated damages specifically provided for in Section 14.2, the recovery
by either Party of any damages suffered or incurred by it as a result of any
breach by the other Party of any of its representations, warranties or
obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to the actual damages
suffered or incurred by the non-breaching Party (and the Indemnified Persons
to which such obligations may extend under the terms hereof) as a result of
the breach by the breaching Party of its representations, warranties or
obligations hereunder and in no event shall the breaching Party be liable to
the non-breaching Party or any Indemnified Person for any indirect,
consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages (including any damages
on account of lost profits or opportunities, business interruption or lost or
delayed production) suffered or incurred by the non-breaching Party or any
Indemnified Person as a result of the breach by the breaching Party of any of
its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder. For purposes of the
foregoing, actual damages may, however, include indirect, consequential,
special, exemplary or punitive damages to the extent (i) the injuries or
losses resulting in or giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by
a Person which is not a Seller Indemnified Person, a Buyer Indemnified Person
or an affiliate of any of the foregoing and (ii) such damages are recovered
against an Indemnified Person by a Person which is not a Seller Indemnified
Person, a Buyer Indemnified Person or an affiliate of any of the foregoing.
This Section 12.3 shall operate only to limit a Party's liability and shall
not operate to increase or expand any contractual obligation of a Party
hereunder or cause any contractual obligation of a Party hereunder to survive
longer than provided in Section 11.3.

subject to the limitations of Section 11.3, Covered Liabilities resulting from
any breach or nonfulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Seller which is expressly set forth in this

Section 13.3 Indemnification and Defense Procedures. A Person which is
entitled to be indemnified under Section 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2 is herein
referred to as an "Indemnified Person" and the Party which is obligated to
indemnify an Indemnified Person under Section 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2 is
herein referred to as the "Indemnifying Party" with respect to the matter for
which it is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Person. All claims for
indemnification under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 and 13.2 shall be asserted
and resolved as follows:

  

  

(a) If a third-party claim for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2 (an "Indemnified Claim") is
made against an Indemnified Person, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto by or from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be, then the Party
electing to seek indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person shall promptly
transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("Claim Notice") (i)
notifying such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnified Claim and requesting
indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person with respect to such
Indemnified Claim under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may
be, (ii) setting forth the full name, address for all notices and the
authorized representatives of such Indemnified Person with respect to such
Indemnified Claim, and (iii) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
Indemnified Claim, including a copy of all papers served with respect to such
Indemnified Claim (if any) and the basis of such request for indemnification
under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be. Failure to
provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby; provided that, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless
an Indemnified Person with respect to a third-party claim until a Claim Notice
meeting the foregoing requirements is furnished to the Indemnifying Party by
the Party seeking indemnity hereunder. Within 30 days after receipt of any
Claim Notice (the "Election Period") from a Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice (A) whether the Indemnifying
Party disputes its potential liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person
under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be, with respect to
such third-party claim and (B) whether the Indemnifying Party desires to
defend the Indemnified Person against such third-party claim; provided that,
if the Indemnifying Party fails to so notify the Party who sent the Claim
Notice during the Election Period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have elected to dispute such liability and not to defend against such third-
party claim.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 28 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Party who sent the Claim Notice
within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b),
13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be, and (ii) elects to assume the defense of
such Indemnified Person with respect to such third-party claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
expense, such third-party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 13.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third-party claim
in a manner) which provides for or results in any payment by or liability of
the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other amount, any lien, charge
or encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified Person, any finding of
responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Person or any
sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified
Person without the Indemnified Person's express written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Person is hereby
authorized, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only
if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder),
to file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings
which the Indemnified Person shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect
its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected
to be prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in contesting any such third-party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects
to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnified Person, if the
Indemnified Person is a Buyer Indemnified Person, or a Seller Indemnified
Person, if the Indemnified Person is a Seller Indemnified Person). The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any third-party claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 13.3(b), and the Indemnified Person shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. The prosecution of
the defense of a third-party claim with reasonable diligence shall include the
taking of such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or other
security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien
against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Person for payment of
such third-party claim.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to notify the Party who sent the Claim
Notice within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) or (ii) elects to defend
the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) but fails to prosecute the
defense of (or to settle) the third-party claim with reasonable diligence,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), the third-party claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly and vigorously
prosecuted by the Indemnified Person to a final conclusion or settled. The
Indemnified Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Person may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such third-party claim, without the Indemnifying
Party's express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section 13.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 29 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) If an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under Sections 5.1,
6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2 for a claim or other matter which does not involve a
third-party claim, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek indemnity for itself
or on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect thereto by or from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, then the
Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of itself or an Indemnified Person
shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice describing
in reasonable detail the nature of such claim or other matter, the Indemnified
Person's reasonable estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such
claim or other matter and the basis for the Indemnified Person's entitlement
to indemnification under Sections 5.1, 6.5(b), 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may
be. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Party who sent such notice
within thirty (30) days from its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party does not dispute such claim for indemnity, the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have disputed such claim.

  

  

Section 13.4 Seller's General Liability Limitation.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) In no event shall Seller's aggregate liability arising out of or relating
to Section 13.2(b) with respect to a breach by Seller of any representation or
warranty made by Seller in Section 4.1 of this Agreement exceed an amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price; and

  

  

(ii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
13.2(b) with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller in Section 4.1 of this Agreement unless the aggregate amount which
would otherwise be payable by Seller thereunder with respect to all breaches
of any such representations and warranties exceeds an amount equal to three
percent (3%) of the Purchase Price (the "Deductible Amount"), and in such
event, Seller shall be responsible for only the amount in excess of the
Deductible Amount.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary but without in
any way affecting the obligations of a Buyer Indemnified Person to notify
Seller of a third-party claim pursuant to Section 13.3, Seller shall not have
any liability to any Person with respect to any Covered Liability pursuant to
Section 13.2 unless and until Buyer uses commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce any and all of the rights and remedies that Buyer may have with
respect to such Covered Liability against any other Person pursuant to (i) any
insurance maintained for the joint account under any operating agreement with
respect to the Assets and (ii) any other agreements for insurance,
indemnification, guarantee or similar assurances which may be included in the
Assets.

  

  

Section 13.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 8.6, Seller and
Buyer acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing Date, the
indemnification provisions of this Article XIII are the sole and exclusive
remedy of Seller and Buyer for the breach of any representation or warranty or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or Buyer
under this Agreement or confirmed in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, and Seller does hereby release, acquit and forever discharge all Buyer
Indemnified Persons and Buyer does hereby release, acquit, and forever
discharge all Seller Indemnified Persons from any such other remedies.

ARTICLE XIV

  

TERMINATION; REMEDIES

  

  

Section 14.1 Termination.

  

  

(a) Termination of Agreement. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

  

  

(i) By the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; or

  

  

(ii) If the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on November
7, 2011 (the "Termination Effective Time"), then (A) by Seller if any
condition specified in Section 9.1 has not been satisfied on or before the
Termination Effective Time, and shall not theretofore have been waived by
Seller, or (B) by Buyer if any condition specified in Section 9.2 has not been
satisfied on or before the Termination Effective Time, and shall not
theretofore have been waived by Buyer; provided, in each case, that the
failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on or before such
time did not result from the failure by the Party seeking termination of this
Agreement to fulfill any undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the
part of such Party that is required to be fulfilled on or prior to Closing.

  

  

(b) Effect of Termination. Without limiting Seller's or Buyer's respective
remedies and rights in regard to the Deposit under Section 14.2, in the event
of termination of this Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, pursuant to Section 14.1(a), written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party, and this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate; provided, however, that Sections 4.1(n),
4.2(g), this Article XIV, Article XV (other than Sections 15.4, 15.9, 15.10,
and 15.16) and the last sentence of Section 8.2 shall survive such termination
and Buyer will continue to be bound by its obligations set forth in Article V
following such termination. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein, all filings, applications and other submissions made to any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the
Governmental Authority to which they were made.

  

  

Section 14.2 Remedies.

  

  

(a) Seller's Remedies. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is not terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
14.1(a)(ii)(B) and the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.1(a),
9.1(b) or 9.1(c) are not satisfied, Seller, at its sole option, may (i)
enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this
Agreement and, without waiving or releasing Buyer's obligations under Sections
5.1 and 5.2, retain the Deposit, including any interest and other amounts
earned thereon, as liquidated damages. Such remedies shall be Seller's sole
and exclusive remedies for such failure, all other remedies being expressly
waived by Seller. Seller and Buyer agree upon the Deposit as liquidated
damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience of measuring actual damages
and the uncertainty thereof, and Seller and Buyer agree that such amount is a
reasonable estimate of Seller's loss in the event of any such failure by
Buyer. Without waiving or releasing Buyer from any of its other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
specific performance with respect to clause (ii)(b) of Section 10.3 shall not
require Buyer to make a false statement in the officer's certificate of Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 31 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Buyer's Remedies. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is not terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
14.1(a)(ii)(A) and the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.2(a),
9.2(b) or 9.2(c) are not satisfied, Buyer, at its sole option, may (i) enforce
specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this Agreement and
receive back the Deposit, together with interest thereon from the date of this
Agreement to the date repayment is made by Seller to Buyer at the Agreed Rate.
Such remedies shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies for such failure,
all other remedies being expressly waived by Buyer. In addition, if this
Agreement is terminated by either Party on account of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Sections 9.1(d), 9.1(e), 9.2(d) or 9.2(e) not being
satisfied and the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.1(a), (b) and
(c) are satisfied, then, notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, Buyer shall be entitled to a return of the Deposit. Without waiving
or releasing Seller from any of its other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, specific performance with respect
to Section 10.2(b) shall not require Seller to make a false statement in the
officer's certificate of Seller.

Section 15.9 Purchase Price Allocation for Tax Purposes. Seller and Buyer
agree that the Purchase Price shall be preliminarily allocated to the various
Assets for federal, state and local income Tax purposes only in the manner set
forth on Schedule 15.9. The allocation of the Purchase Price shall be
reflected on the completed Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement Under

Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the requirements of section 1060(b) of

described therein. The Parties agree to revise the allocations set forth on

portion of such period beginning at the Effective Time. For any such Property

necessary pursuant to the provisions of Section 1031 of the Code and the

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES

  

  

The Arbitration Procedures referred to in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement") to which this Exhibit A-1 is attached shall be as follows:

  

  

    

1.

  |  

Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to such terms in the Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

2.

  |  

 

(a) With respect to unresolved Deferred Adjustment Claims, within five (5)
Business Days of the Deferred Matters Date, Seller and Buyer shall each submit
to the other the list of what such Party considers to comprise the remaining
unresolved Deferred Adjustment Claims. The two lists shall together comprise
the "Disputed Issues" relating to Deferred Adjustment Claims which shall be
resolved by the binding arbitration provided for herein.

 

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) If, pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Agreement, either Buyer or Seller elect
to submit any Final Adjustment Statement disagreements to arbitration, such
disagreements will also constitute "Disputed Issues" to be resolved by the
binding arbitration provided for herein.

  

  

    

3.

  |  

Seller and Buyer, each being duly authorized by all necessary corporate,
limited partnership or other proceedings, shall submit the Disputed Issues to
binding arbitration by a board of arbitration to be selected by the following
procedures. Notices hereunder shall be sufficient if sent in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement. With respect to Disputed Issues involving Deferred
Adjustment Claims, within five (5) days after the Deferred Matters Date,
Seller shall by written notice to Buyer name one arbitrator and Buyer shall by
written notice to Seller name one arbitrator. With respect to Disputed Issues
involving Final Adjustment Statement disagreements, within five (5) days after
either Buyer or Seller provides the other Party with written notice that such
Party desires to submit such Final Adjustment Statement disagreements to
arbitration, Seller shall by written notice to Buyer name one arbitrator and
Buyer shall by written notice to Seller name one arbitrator. If a Party fails
to name an arbitrator, the other Party shall by further written notice to the
other Party name the second arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed shall
name the third arbitrator within ten (10) days after the selection of the
second arbitrator. If they fail to do so, either arbitrator may request the
judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas
having greatest tenure, but not yet on retired or senior status, to appoint
the third arbitrator. If that judge fails to do so within thirty (30) days,
either Party may request the judge of that court next senior to name the third
arbitrator, and if that judge fails to do so after ten (10) days, either Party
may make the request of the judge of that court next senior, and so on, until
the board of arbitration is constituted. Each arbitrator must be experienced
in and knowledgeable about the oil and gas exploration and production business
(including, in the case of Deferred Adjustment Claims, land and title matters)
and, to the extent the Disputed Issues relate to accounting, must be
experienced in and knowledgeable about oil and gas accounting matters. In
addition, the third arbitrator, in each case, shall be required to meet the
qualification requirements of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"), whether appointed by the
arbitrators or by a judge as provided above.

Exhibit A-1, Page 1  

  

 

 

 

   
 

    

4.

  |  

If prior to rendering a decision an arbitrator resigns or becomes unable to
serve, the arbitrator shall be replaced as follows. If that arbitrator was one
of the two arbitrators appointed by a Party, the Party that named him or her
shall name a replacement; provided, however, that if that replacement is not
named within five (5) days from notice of resignation or inability to serve,
the other Party shall name a replacement. If he or she was the third
arbitrator, the other two arbitrators shall name a replacement; provided,
however, that if they fail to agree on a replacement within ten (10) days,
either arbitrator may follow the procedures specified in Paragraph 3 above and
request judicial appoint of the replacement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.

  |  

No Party subject to these Arbitration Procedures will commence or prosecute
any suit or action against the other Party subject to these Arbitration
Procedures relating to the Disputed Issues, other than as may be necessary to
compel arbitration under these Arbitration Procedures or to enforce the award
of the board of arbitration.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

6.

  |  

The board of arbitration may in all matters act through a majority of its
members on each matter if unanimity is not attained. It shall not be necessary
that the same majority agree on each and every item; that is, the Parties will
be bound by majority rulings on each Disputed Issue even though the majority
is not the same as to each Disputed Issue. In fulfilling their duties
hereunder with respect to Deferred Adjustment Claims, each of the arbitrators
shall be bound by the matters set forth in Article VI of the Agreement. The
arbitrators shall not add any interest factor reflecting the time value of
money to any Title Defect Amount.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

7.

  |  

No matters whatsoever, other than the Disputed Issues, are subject to the
agreement to arbitrate embodied in these Arbitration Procedures. The board of
arbitration shall be empowered hereunder solely to resolve the Disputed
Issues. The board of arbitration shall not have any authority to award
indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages. The sole forum for the
arbitration shall be Harris County, Texas and all hearings shall be conducted
in Harris County, Texas.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.

  |  

The decision of the board of arbitration shall be rendered in writing and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties as to the Disputed Issues. The
expenses of arbitration, including reasonable compensation to the third
arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the Parties. Each Party shall bear the
compensation and expenses of its own counsel, witnesses and employees and of
any arbitrator it has appointed. If the testimony of a witness is obtained by
both Parties, the costs associated with obtaining such testimony shall be
borne equally between the Parties.
