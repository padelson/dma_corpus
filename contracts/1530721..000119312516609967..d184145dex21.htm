Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Escrow Agent no fewer than two Business Days

the Release Event. Any funds in the Escrow Account (inclusive of any interest
earned thereon less Tax distributions paid to the Buyer in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement) not so used shall be distributed to the Seller, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 



14 Section 2.4 _Withholding_. The Buyer shall deduct and withhold from any

than with respect to PRC Withholding Taxes (the procedures for which are set
forth in Section 2.5) the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide advance written notice to any Person on behalf of which any such
deduction and withholding is expected and shall cooperate with any reasonable
request from any such Person to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. The provisions of Section
8.3(e) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to this Section 2.4.

 

Section 2.5 _PRC Withholding Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limits set forth in this Section 2.5, from and after the
Closing, the Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Tax Indemnified
Buyer Parties harmless from and against any Losses that the Tax Indemnified
Buyer Parties suffer, sustain or incur to the extent arising out of, in
connection with, with respect to or due to any PRC withholding Taxes with
respect to the transfer of the Shares by the Seller hereunder, as assessed
and finally determined by a competent PRC Tax Authority (the " _PRC
Withholding Taxes_ ").

 

(b) With respect to PRC Withholding Taxes, the Buyer shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent, cash in an amount equal to
$47,500,000 (the " _PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Amount_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Escrow
Agent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "
_PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Account_ "); for the avoidance of doubt, the PRC
Withholding Tax Escrow Account shall be separate and distinct from the Escrow
Account.

 

(c) (i) The Seller shall, as soon as possible but in any event no later than
thirty (30) days after the signing of this Agreement, report to the competent
PRC Tax Authority the Contemplated Transactions with respect to the share
transfer conducted by the Seller in accordance with Circular 698, Bulletin 7
and other applicable PRC Tax Laws. The Buyer shall have the right (but not
an obligation) to review and comment on any and all application documents in
connection with the share transfer to be submitted by the Seller to the
competent PRC Tax Authority. The Seller shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments of the Buyer on such application documents; _provided_
that the Seller shall be entitled to submit such application to the PRC Tax
Authority without incorporating any changes with which the Seller disagrees in
good faith to the extent necessary to avoid submitting the application later
than thirty (30) days after the signing of this Agreement. The Buyer shall
have the right to appoint a

 



15  representative to witness the submission of the application documents. The
Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of any acknowledgment of receipt received
from the PRC Tax Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer (or its
representative) shall be entitled to witness interactions with the PRC Tax
Authority but shall not have any other right to participate in any discussions
with the PRC Tax Authority.

 

(ii) The Escrow Agent shall retain the PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Amount in
the PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Account until the earliest of the occurrence
of any of the following:

(A) At a meeting with tax officials of the PRC Tax Authority, including
senior/competent authority ( _e.g._ , a department chief, director or
substantially similar official), after the introduction of the Contemplated
Transactions by the Seller and/or its representative, and as witnessed by the
Buyer and/or its representative, the tax officials provide oral or written
confirmation, in either case, satisfactory to the Buyer in its reasonable
judgment; _provided_ that any oral or written confirmation substantially to
the effect of the following (and which, in any event, shall include a
statement substantially to the effect of the last sentence set forth below)
shall be satisfactory to the Buyer:

 

 _< The PRC Tax Authority (i) agrees that the Seller did not "use an
arrangement that does not have a reasonable commercial purpose" to avoid its
obligation to pay enterprise income tax in China, and (ii) agrees that the
transfer of the Shares by the Seller hereunder does not involve an indirect
transfer that is treated as a direct transfer of equity interests in a China
tax resident enterprise. Therefore, the PRC Tax Authority is of the opinion
that no PRC income Tax is required to be paid as a result of the transfer of
the Shares by the Seller hereunder.>_

 

and the minutes of such meetings or conferences with the PRC Tax Authority
prepared by the Seller and its representatives or advisors reflect such oral
or written confirmation.

(B) The Seller delivers a final tax assessment notice or invoice and a tax
payment receipt issued by the PRC Tax Authority, evidencing that any
applicable PRC Withholding Taxes have been paid in full by or on behalf of the
Seller; or

 

(C) The three-year anniversary of the date of the transaction reporting with
the PRC Tax Authority pursuant to Section 2.5(c).

(iii) Upon the occurrence of the earliest of any of Section 2.5(c)(ii)(A)-(C)
(a " _Release Event_ "), the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow

 



16  Agent to distribute the PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Amount to the Seller
within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such joint written instruction
via wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated
by the Seller in accordance with Section 3.2(b)(i).

(iv) If, prior to a Release Event, the Seller

(A) determines (in consultation with the Buyer and the PRC Tax Authority) to
pay to the competent PRC Tax Authority the PRC Withholding Tax, or

(B) is required by the competent PRC Tax Authority to pay the PRC
Withholding Taxes,

the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer from the
PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Account an amount equal to the PRC Withholding
Taxes determined based on the final tax assessment notice or invoice, who
shall promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
receipt of such funds from the Escrow Agent, make payment of such PRC
Withholding Taxes to the competent PRC Tax Authority on behalf of the Seller.
The Buyer shall provide the Seller with written proof (including the tax
payment receipt) of its payment of the applicable PRC Withholding Taxes on
behalf of the Seller. Such amounts paid to the competent PRC Tax Authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Seller.

 

(v) To the extent that there is any surplus in the PRC Withholding Tax Escrow
Account after the Buyer has paid the PRC Withholding Taxes on behalf of the
Seller to the competent PRC Tax Authority pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(iv)(A) or
Section 2.5(c)(iv)(B) above, the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute such surplus (inclusive of any interest earned on the PRC
Withholding Tax Escrow Account less Tax distributions paid to the Buyer in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) to the Seller within three (3) Business
Days of receipt of such joint written instruction via wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Seller in
accordance with Section 3.2(b); _provided_ , that any such surplus shall be
released only to the extent that it exceeds outstanding and unpaid or
unresolved claims for indemnification under Section 2.5(a) above. To the
extent (i) the PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay the
applicable tax liability of the Seller and (ii) no Release Event has
occurred, the Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after request by the
Buyer or a shorter period as required by the relevant competent PRC Tax
Authority, pay to the competent PRC Tax Authority the balance as determined
based on the final tax assessment notice or invoice; _provided_ , that any
such balance shall be satisfied solely out of the Escrow Account.

 



17 (vi) The Seller shall, and shall cause its representatives to, provide
any documents, information and/or other assistance reasonably requested by
the Buyer in connection with its payment of PRC Withholding Taxes on behalf of
the Seller.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. The Seller shall respond as soon as reasonably practicable

applicable Laws.

 



27 (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date taxable income

connection with obtaining Tax exemptions, Tax holidays, Tax deferrals, Tax
incentives or other preferential Tax treatments or Tax rebates contained any
material misstatement or omission that would have affected the granting of
such Tax exemptions, preferential treatments or rebates. No suspension,
revocation or cancellation of any such Tax exemptions, preferential treatments
or rebates is pending or threatened in writing. The Company has no reason to
believe that the Contemplated Transactions will have any material adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemptions,
preferential treatments or rebates or will result in the clawback or

its properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted. The
Buyer is duly licensed or qualified and in good standing as a foreign limited
liability company in all jurisdictions in which it is required to be so

into this Agreement or consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 6.2 _Due Authorization_. The Buyer has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Document to which it is or
will be a

 



40  party and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and
delivery by the Buyer of each Transaction Document to which it is or will be a
party and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions has been duly and
validly authorized and approved by the board of managing officers of the
Buyer, and no other proceeding, consent or authorization on the part of the
Buyer is necessary to authorize any Transaction Document to which it is or
will be a party or the Contemplated Transactions. Each Transaction Document to
which the Buyer is or will be a party, has been or will be duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Buyer and constitutes, or will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against the
Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 6.3 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery by the Buyer of each
Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party and the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions do not and will not:

(a) breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under any provision
of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
result in a breach or violation of or conflict or default under, or accelerate
the performance required or result in the termination of or give any Person
the right to terminate, any material Contract to which the Buyer is a party or
by which any of the Buyers assets are bound, in each case, except for those,
which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

(b) assuming compliance with the matters addressed in Section 6.4, breach,
violate, conflict with or result in a default under, any provision of, or
constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result
in a breach or violation of or, conflict or default under, in each case in
any material respect, any applicable material Law or Order binding upon or
applicable to the Buyer, except for those, which would not reasonably be
expected to materially impair the Buyers ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement;

(c) violate or conflict with the Organizational Documents of the Buyer; or

 

(d) result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, on any assets of the Buyer, except for

effect on the Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.4 _No Authorization or Consents Required_. Assuming the truth and
completeness of the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in
this Agreement, no notice to, consent, approval or authorization of or
designation, declaration or filing with any Governmental Authority or other
Person is required by the Buyer with respect to the Buyers execution
or delivery of any Transaction Document to which it is in will be a party or

Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



41 Section 6.5 _Litigation_. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Buyer, threatened Actions before or by any Governmental Authority against the
Buyer that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or restrict the
ability of the Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations under any
Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party. The Buyer is not
subject to any outstanding Order that prohibits or otherwise restricts the
ability of the Buyer to consummate fully the Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Investment Purpose_. The Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its
own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
any distribution of such securities in violation of any federal, state or
foreign securities Laws. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is
informed as to the risks of the Contemplated Transactions and the ownership
of the Shares. The Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Shares pursuant to this Agreement and protecting its own
interests in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. The Buyer
acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under any federal, state
or foreign securities Laws and that the Shares may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such
transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is

of an effective registration statement under any applicable securities Laws or
pursuant to an exemption from registration under applicable federal, state or
foreign securities Laws.

_Section_ _ _ _6.7_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter, which will be paid by the
Buyer or its Affiliate at or prior to the Closing, there are no claims for
brokerage, finders or other advisory fees, costs, expenses, commissions or
other similar payments in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based on any Contract made by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

representations and warranties contained in this Article VI, neither the Buyer
nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Buyer, and the Buyer hereby disclaims any such other

Subsidiaries) shall have the right and remedy, without regard to any other
available remedy, to (A) have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced
by any court of competent jurisdiction and (B) have issued an injunction
restraining any such breach without posting of a bond; it being understood
that any breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable

Company and each of its Subsidiaries) will have any adequate remedy at law or

44  amended to the extent necessary in order that such provision be valid and
enforceable, the remainder of such Restrictive Covenant shall not thereby be
affected and shall be given full effect without regard to invalid portions
and such amendment shall apply only with respect to the operation of the
Restrictive Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication
is made; and

 

(iii) the parties acknowledge and agree that the Restrictive Covenants are
necessary for the protection and preservation of the value and the goodwill

prohibit any party from issuing or causing publication of any such press
release or public announcement to the extent that such disclosure is required

party shall provide the other party with copies of any such press release,
announcement or public disclosure reasonably in advance of such issuance and
in good faith consider such other partys comments thereon; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict confidential communications
between any party and the investors of such party in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice to the extent such investors are
subject to customary confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.

(c) Effective upon the Closing, each of the Seller and SHL, on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, hereby expressly
waives and releases any rights and benefits which such party has or may have

appropriate Governmental Authority to change their respective
legal, registered, assumed, trade and "doing business as" names, as
applicable, to a name or names not containing "Michael Kors", "MK" or any name
confusingly similar to any of the foregoing. Subsequent to any such filing,
the Seller shall, and SHL shall cause the Seller and each of the MK Holdcos
to, take all other actions necessary to change their respective legal,
registered, assumed, trade and "doing business as" names, as applicable, to a
name or names not containing "Michael Kors" or any name confusingly similar
to any of the foregoing and will cause to be filed as soon as practicable
after the Closing, in all jurisdictions in which the Seller and the MK
Holdcos, as applicable, are qualified to do business, any documents necessary
to reflect such change in their respective legal, registered, assumed, trade
and "doing business as" names, as applicable, or to terminate its
qualification therein. The Seller and SHL further agree that from and after
the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and SHL

former directors, officers, shareholders and their respective Affiliates,
agents and representatives, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the

 



47  " _Indemnified D andO Parties_") as provided in their respective
Organizational Documents entered into on or prior to the date hereof, shall
survive the Contemplated Transactions and shall continue in full force and
effect and (ii) following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect provisions in the Organizational

Indemnified DandO Parties that are not less favorable to those contained in the
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case,
for a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.8 shall limit any
applicable rights an Indemnified Buyer Party would be entitled to pursuant to
Section 8.2 or Section 9.2, and nothing in this Section 7.8 shall be construed
as precluding amounts paid to Indemnified DandO Parties pursuant to this
Section 7.8 from constituting Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8.2 or
Section 9.2 to the extent such Losses are indemnifiable in accordance with the
terms and limitations set forth in Section 8.2 and Section 9.2, as
applicable.

(b) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified DandO Parties and their
heirs and legal representatives.

representatives under this Section 7.8 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified DandO Parties may have under the Organizational Documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any agreements between such persons
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws.

 

Section 7.9 _Cooperation with Filings_. From and after the Closing, the Seller

Tang Shiu Fai to cooperate with the Company and MK Shanghai to complete any
governmental filings required under the PRC Laws, including the filings
required for the change of legal representative and change of composition of
the board of directors or similar governing body of MK Shanghai.

against and hold them harmless from any and all Losses suffered or arising out
of, in each case, without duplication, and with respect to any Losses
attributable to the PRC IIT Matter (as defined below), other than the
Aggregate Funded PRC IIT Amount (as defined below) (provided that this
exception for the Aggregate Funded PRC IIT Amount (as defined below) shall not
apply to Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnified Buyer Party as a result of a
breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.26), (i)
other than Taxes that are

 



48  accrued as a liability on the Financial Statements and set forth on
_Section_ _ _ _8.1(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Lockbox Date (" _Pre-Lockbox Taxes_ "), (ii) Taxes imposed on a Tax
Indemnified Buyer Party as a result of (x) a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 5.11, other than Taxes that are accrued as a
liability on the Financial Statements and set forth on _Section_ _ _
_8.1(a)(i)_ or _Section_ _ _ _8.1(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(provided that the foregoing exception in this clause (x) for Taxes that are
accrued as a liability on the Financial Statements and set forth on _Section_
_ _ _8.1(a)(i)_ or _Section_ _ _ _8.1(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
shall not apply to Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnified Buyer Party as a result
of a breach of the representations and warranties contained in the second
sentence of Section 5.11(b)), or (y) a breach of a covenant or agreement set
forth in Section 2.5 or Article VIII; _provided_ , that for purposes of this
clause (ii) of this Section 8.1(a) only, any breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined without reference to any
materiality qualifier set forth therein or any exception disclosed thereto,
(iii) Taxes directly or indirectly attributable to the failure of MK Shanghai
to report to the applicable Tax Authority, or withhold Taxes attributable
to, income allocated to Patrick Lee and James Lee for the years ending March
31, 2012 through March 31, 2016 for their services to MK Shanghai during such
period, or Taxes otherwise directly or indirectly attributable to the matters
described in  _Section_ _ _ _5.11(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "
_PRC IIT Matter_ "), for the avoidance of doubt in excess of the Aggregate
Funded PRC IIT Amount (as defined below), (iv) Taxes for which the Seller
is responsible pursuant to Section 8.6, Section 8.7 or Section 8.8 or (v)
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
attributable to any item described in clauses (i) through (v) above.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the representations and
warranties of the Seller and the Company contained in Section 5.11 (Taxes) of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect
with respect to any claim based on such representations and warranties until
the earlier of (i) the date which is 60 days after the date upon which the
liability to which any such claim may relate is barred by all applicable
statutes of limitations (including all periods of extension, whether
automatic or permissive) or (ii) the third anniversary of the Closing Date. If
the Buyer delivers written notice to the Seller of a claim for indemnification
within the survival period applicable to such claim in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, such claim shall survive until finally
resolved or judicially determined. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all claims by the Tax Indemnified Buyer Parties for
indemnification with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Section
8.1 shall be satisfied solely out of any funds remaining in the Escrow
Account.

 

(b) _Refunds_. If following the Lockbox Date, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries realizes any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, which are of a type for which the Seller has an
indemnification obligation under Section 8.1(a), the Company shall pay to the
Seller the amount so realized, net of any cost (including any Tax cost)
of obtaining any such refund or utilizing any such credit. The parties hereby
acknowledge that any such payment shall not be considered an Affiliate
Payment. For purposes of this Section 8.1(b), (i) a refund shall be deemed to
be realized when actually received, and (ii) a credit shall be deemed to

 



49  be realized when and to the extent a payment of any Tax of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is actually reduced by such credit (on a with-or-without basis).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such refund or economic benefit of any
credit shall be paid to the extent (x) such amount resulted from the carrying
back to any Pre-Lockbox Tax Period of any Tax attribute attributable to any
period thereafter or (y) the aggregate amount of indemnification claims made
pursuant to Article VIII and Article IX exceeds the Escrow Amount. In the
event that any refund is subsequently disallowed by any applicable Tax
Authority, the Seller shall promptly remit any payments received under this
Section 8.1(b) in respect of such disallowed amounts. The Buyers and the
Sellers obligations under this Section 8.1(b) shall survive until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date.

Section 8.2 _Tax Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) After the Closing, the Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing
of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an Action received by
such party from any Tax Authority or any other Person with respect to Taxes
for which the Seller is liable pursuant to Section 8.1; _provided_ , _however_
, that a failure to give such notice will not affect the Buyers rights to
indemnification under this Article VIII, except to the extent that the Seller
is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax Liability and shall include
copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from
any Tax Authority or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax
Liability.

 

(b) Payment by the Seller of any amount due to the Tax Indemnified Buyer
Parties under Article VIII shall be made within ten days following written
notice by the Tax Indemnified Buyer Parties that payment of such amounts to
the appropriate Tax Authority or other applicable third party is due by the
Tax Indemnified Buyer Parties; _provided_ that the Seller shall not
be required to make any payment earlier than five Business Days before it is
due to the appropriate Tax Authority or applicable third party. In the case of
a Tax that is contested in accordance with Section 8.3, payment of such
contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by such Tax Authority or a court.

(c) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by the Buyer.

Law applicable to the Tax giving rise to the payment hereunder.

 



50 Section 8.3 _Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Closing, except as provided in Sections 8.3(b) and 8.3(c), the
Buyer shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing and at
its own expense, of any audit, claim for refund or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax Liability or refund with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such audit, claim for refund
or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax Liability referred to herein as a "
_Contest_ ").

(b) In the case of a Contest after the Closing that relates solely to Taxes
for which the Buyer is indemnified under Section 8.1(a) and which do not
exceed by more than $50,000 the amount of funds remaining in the Escrow
Account at the time such contest is initiated, the Seller shall control the
conduct of such Contest, but the Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such Contest at its own expense, and the Seller shall not be able to settle,
compromise or concede any such Contest without the consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ , that if the Seller fails to assume control of the
conduct of any such Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt
by the Seller of notice of such Contest, the Buyer shall have the right to
assume control of such Contest but shall not be able to settle, compromise or
concede such Contest without the consent of the Seller, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if, at any
time before the resolution of a Contest otherwise described in this Section
8.3(a), the amount of Taxes at issue exceeds the amount then remaining in the
Escrow Account, the Buyer shall have the option to assume control of such
Contest in accordance with the procedures described in Section 8.3(c).

(c) In the case of a Contest after the Closing that (i) relates solely to
Taxes for which the Buyer is indemnified which exceeds the amount of funds
remaining in the Escrow Account by more than $50,000 at the time the contest
is initiated or (ii) relates both to Taxes for which the Buyer is indemnified
under Section 8.1(a) and Taxes for which the Buyer is not indemnified under
Section 8.1(a), the Buyer shall control the conduct of such Contest, but the
Seller shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its own
expense, and the Buyer shall not settle, compromise or concede such Contest
without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any expenses that are the responsibility
of the Seller pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or this Section 8.3(c) shall be
satisfied solely from any funds remaining in the Escrow Account.

 

(d) The Seller and the Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to employees and books and records) and assistance relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of any
Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any
Contest or in connection with the PRC Withholding Taxes. The Seller and the
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any Contest or other proceeding involving or otherwise
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their income or assets) with
respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney
and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
8.3(d). Any information obtained under this Section 8.3(d) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax Action.

 



51 (e) Each of the Buyer and the Company shall (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax and accounting
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods for five years and shall thereafter provide the Seller with written
notice prior to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any
portions of such records, (ii) transfer such records to the Seller upon its
written request prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition and
(iii) allow the Seller and its agents and representatives, at times and dates
reasonably and mutually acceptable to the parties, to from time to time
inspect and review such records as the Seller may deem necessary or
appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases, such activities are
to be conducted by the Seller during normal business hours and at the Sellers
sole expense. Any information obtained under this Section 8.3(e) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Action primarily
related to Taxes.

Section 8.4 _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

(a) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file, at its
own expense, all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
required to be filed with any Tax Authority after the Closing Date and shall
pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With
respect to any Tax Returns filed with respect to any taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Lockbox Date (" _Pre-Lockbox Tax
Periods_ "), the Seller shall be responsible for the Pre-Lockbox Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns other than any Pre-Lockbox Taxes that are accrued
as a liability on the Financial Statements and set forth on _Section_ _ _
_8.4(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Buyer shall notify the Seller of
any amounts due from the Seller in respect of any such Tax Return no later
than ten Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and
the Seller shall remit such payment to the Buyer out of any funds remaining in
the Escrow Account no later than five Business Days prior to the date such
Tax Return is due.

(b) In the case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to a Pre-Lockbox
Tax Period or a Straddle Period, the Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice, except as
otherwise required by Law, and shall deliver any such Tax Return to the Seller
for its review at least 30 days prior to the date such Tax Return is required
to be filed. If the Seller disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall
notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its
objection, and the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for 15
days following the Buyers receipt of such notice to resolve such objections.
If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve all objections during such
15-day period, then any remaining disputes, and only such remaining disputes,
shall be resolved by Deloitte or, if Deloitte is not available for such
assignment, another "big four" accounting firm upon which the Buyer and the
Seller shall reasonably agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining disputes in

 



52  accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30 days after its
appointment. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other hand.

(c) Except as required by applicable Law or the resolution of a Contest
(settled in accordance with Section 8.3), or as set forth in Section 8.4(d),
neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of the
Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (i) make or change any Tax election with respect to a Pre-
Lockbox Tax Period or (ii) amend or refile (or grant an extension of any
applicable statute of limitations with respect to) any Tax Return relating to
a Pre-Lockbox Tax Period.

(d) To the extent not paid prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall cause MK
Shanghai to, promptly and in no event later than ten (10) days after the
Closing Date, voluntarily disclose the PRC IIT Matter to the applicable Tax
Authority and request a resolution of the amount owed and an abatement of any
applicable penalties attributable to the PRC IIT Matter, and the Buyer shall
cause MK Shanghai to timely pay to the applicable Tax Authority the amount
agreed with such Tax Authority to be owed with respect to the PRC IIT Matter
as set forth in an applicable voucher (such amount, the " _Settled PRC IIT
Amount_ "). To the extent the Settled PRC IIT Amount is less than (i) RMB
4,818,585.50 with respect to Patrick Lee or (ii) RMB 1,133,989.53 with respect
to James Lee (each such amount, a " _Funded PRC IIT Amount_ ", and the
aggregate total of such amounts, or RMB 5,952,575.03, the " _Aggregate Funded
PRC IIT Amount_ "), the Buyer shall promptly reimburse Patrick Lee or James
Lee, as applicable, for the applicable excess amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, and to avoid duplication, any amount of Tax that is included in the
Aggregate Funded PRC IIT Amount shall not be indemnified by the Seller or paid
by the Seller or from the Escrow Account.

 

Section 8.5 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are payable with
respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends after the Lockbox Date
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-
Lockbox Taxes shall (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon
or related to income or receipts or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount
that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Lockbox Date and
(b) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in Section 8.5(a)) that
are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period), _multiplied by_ a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Lockbox Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
(a) of the preceding section, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
(including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that is calculated on an
annual 

 



53  basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Lockbox Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of
such item allocated to the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Lockbox Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based
upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this clause (b)
of this Section 8.5 shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Lockbox Date.

Section 8.6 _Conveyance Taxes_. Except as specifically set forth in Section
8.7 or Section 8.8, the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, shall each pay when due, and be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
any sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary,
excise, intangible, real property transfer or gains or similar Taxes incurred
as a result of the Contemplated Transactions and the Seller and the Buyer
shall jointly, to the extent required by Law, file all required change of
ownership forms, similar statements and other Tax Returns related to
conveyance taxes required to be paid in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 8.7 _Hong Kong Stamp Duty_.

(a) The parties acknowledge that a stamp duty will be assessed and payable in
Hong Kong in respect of the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated
hereby (the " _HK Stamp Duty_ "). The Buyer shall cause the duly executed
Transfer Documents to be lodged in the Stamp Duty Office of Hong Kong
for stamping within the period specified in the Stamp Duty Ordinance and, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, pay the full amount of the
HK Stamp Duty as assessed by the Stamp Duty Office of Hong Kong. The Seller
shall reimburse the Buyer, within two (2) Business Days following payment by
the Buyer of the HK Stamp Duty, for an amount (if any) equal to the excess of
(x) fifty percent (50%) of the HK Stamp Duty over (y) the Seller HK Stamp Duty
Withheld Amount. If the Seller HK Stamp Duty Withheld Amount exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the HK Stamp Duty, then the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller
for such excess within two (2) Business Days following payment by the Buyer of
the HK Stamp Duty.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Buyer will cause the register of members
of the Company to be updated promptly upon the payment of the HK Stamp Duty
and the stamping of the Transfer Documents and will make, or cause the Company
to make, all necessary filings, registrations and/or notifications with the
applicable Governmental Authority in respect of the sale and purchase of
the Shares. In connection therewith, the Seller shall cooperate with the
Buyer in all respects to (i) direct the secretary of the Company to accept
instructions from individuals nominated by the Buyer and (ii) provide all
other assistance reasonably necessary to facilitate the foregoing actions by
the Buyer and/or the Company.

Section 8.8 _China Stamp Duty_. The parties acknowledge that a stamp duty may
be assessed and payable in China in respect of the indirect sale and purchase
of

 



54  the shares of MK Shanghai (the " _China Stamp Duty_ "). If the China Stamp
Duty is due on the indirect sale and purchase of the shares of MK Shanghai,
the Buyer shall cause the duly executed Transfer Documents to be lodged with
the competent PRC Tax Authority for stamping within the prescribed period
specified by the competent PRC Tax Authority and, as soon as reasonably
practicable after notice of payment due, each of the Buyer and the Seller
shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the full amount of the China Stamp Duty as
assessed by the Stamp Duty Office of the competent PRC Tax Authority.

 

Section 8.9 _Conflicts_. The provisions of Article IX shall not apply to Tax
matters except as expressly set forth therein. In the event of a conflict
between this Article VIII and Article IX, this Article VIII shall govern with
respect to Tax matters.

Parties with respect to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise
be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) exceeds $2,500,000 (the

(including by using commercially reasonable efforts to recover any insurance
as may be available with respect to such Loss) upon and after becoming aware
of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to such Losses;

Section 9.6 _Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the
commencement of any Action involving a third party (such Action, a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto
is to be made against any party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), give such Indemnifying
Party written notice of such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light
of the circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
such failure to give notice shall prejudice any defense or claim available to
the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense; _provided_
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue
control of (but shall be entitled to participate in) the defense of any Third
Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal Action, (ii) the Third Party Claim has or would reasonably
be expected to result in Losses in excess of 150% of the amounts

 



58  available for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.4, (iii) the Third Party
Claim would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (iv) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim, or (v)
(x) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction against any Indemnified Party
that seeks to enjoin the Company or its Subsidiaries from conducting any
business activities and (y) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with legal counsel, that such claim for injunctive relief cannot
reasonably be separated from any related claim for money damages;  _provided_
, that if such claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion
relating to money damages.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
(i) it shall not settle the Third Party Claim unless either (A) the
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing thereto (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or (B) (1) the settlement
does not entail any admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified
Party, (2) the settlement includes an unconditional release of each Buyer
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all Losses with respect to such
Third Party Claim and (3) it shall indemnify and hold the Indemnified Party
harmless from and against any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any
settlement or judgment of such claim and may not claim that it does not have
an indemnification obligation with respect thereto, and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ, at its own expense, counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party; except that the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim if the
Indemnifying Party shall have any obligation as a result of such settlement
(whether monetary or otherwise) unless such settlement is consented to in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Any
consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section 9.6
shall be given by the Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and any consent to be given by the Seller Indemnified Parties under
this Section 9.6 shall be given by the Seller acting on behalf of the Seller
Indemnified Parties.

(f) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of
any claim on account of any Losses that do not result from a Third Party Claim
as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware thereof, which notice
shall 

 



59  describe such claim in good faith and in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

Section 9.7 _Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition_. The right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies based on any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in any
Transaction Document (including indemnification under Article VIII) or in any
document delivered with respect hereto or thereto will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to or any Knowledge or information
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (other than disclosures made in the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure
Letter, as applicable).

 

Section 9.8 _Additional Matters_. For purposes of this Article IX, including
for determining the existence of a breach and the amount of Losses, the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been made without any qualifications as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect, except for such qualifications set forth in Section 5.10.

Section 9.9 _Escrow Release_.

 

(a) On November 30, 2017, the Seller and Buyer shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to release to the Seller, to an

Section 9.6, respectively (such amounts in clause (ii), the " _Initial
Release Unpaid Claims Amount_ "). The Initial Release Unpaid Claims Amount
shall be paid to the Buyer if, as and when required in accordance with the
terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement. After the resolution and payment of
all claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties prior to November 30, 2017
in respect of which the Initial Release Unpaid Claims Amount was retained, the
Seller and the Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing it to release to the Seller, to an account or accounts
specified in writing by the Seller, the portion (if any) of the Initial
Release Unpaid Claims Amount not paid to the Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) On the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to

same term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise
transferred (including by operation of Law or otherwise) by any party without
the prior written consent of the other party, and any purported assignment or

63  such consent shall be void and unenforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without written consent of any party hereto, either party may assign its
rights and obligations to any of its Affiliates, but no assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any Liability hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Nothing in this Agreement shall

Section 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of

or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of New York.

 

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any Action
seeking to enforce any provision of, or, directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
shall be brought in any New York state or federal court located in New York
County, in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such Action and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in
any such court or that any such Action brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that by
mailing a copy of the service of process by registered or certified mail (or
any substantially similar form of mail) postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in Section 10.5 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



64 Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by the other party in accordance with the

shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions hereof and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition
to any other remedy at law or equity.

 

Section 10.13 _Severability_. Without limitation to Section 7.2(d)(ii), which
shall govern for purposes of Section 7.2, if any provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Contemplated
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such a determination, the Buyer, the Company and the
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner so that the Contemplated Transactions may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.14 _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or PDF_. This Agreement may
be signed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the
signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such
counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when, and only when, each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
This Agreement and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered
by means of a facsimile machine or electronically transmitted portable
document format, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

Section 10.15 _Representations and Warranties of SHL_. Except as set forth
on  _Section_ _ _ _10.15_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, SHL represents and
warrants to the Buyer as follows:

(a) SHL has been duly organized, is validly existing and is in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. SHL has the requisite
power and authority to own or lease its assets and properties and to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted. SHL is duly licensed or qualified
and is in good standing as a foreign entity in all jurisdictions in which it
is required to be so licensed or qualified, except where failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the ability
of SHL to enter into this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder.

(b) SHL has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver each
Transaction Document to which SHL is or will be a party and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery by SHL of each
Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party and the consummation
of the

 



65  Contemplated Transactions has been duly and validly authorized and approved
by the board of directors or other applicable governing body or
representatives of SHL, and no other proceeding, consent or authorization on
the part of SHL is necessary to authorize any Transaction Document to which it
is or will be a party or to perform its obligations hereunder. Each
Transaction Document to which SHL is or will be a party has been or will be
duly and validly executed and delivered by SHL and constitutes, or will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of SHL, enforceable against
SHL in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

(c) There are no pending or threatened Actions before or by any Governmental
Authority against SHL that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
or restrict the ability of SHL to enter into and perform SHLs obligations
under any Transaction Document to which SHL is or will be a party. SHL is not
subject to any outstanding Order that prohibits or otherwise restricts
the ability of SHL to perform its obligations hereunder.

(d) The execution and delivery by SHL of each Transaction Document to which
SHL is or will be a party and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions do not and will not:

(i) breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under any provision
of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
result in a breach, violation, conflict or default under, or accelerate the
performance required or result in the termination of or give any Person the
right to terminate, any material Contract to which SHL is a party or by which
any of SHLs assets are bound, in each case, except for those which would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on SHLs ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under, any
provision of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would result in a breach or violation of or conflict or default under,
in each case in any material respect, any applicable material Law or Order
binding upon or applicable to SHL, except for those which would not reasonably
be expected to materially impair SHLs ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement;

 

(iii) violate or conflict with any Organizational Documents of SHL; or

 

(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, on any assets of SHL, except for
those which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on SHLs ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 10.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, in tort, at law, in
equity or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the

 



66  negotiation, execution, termination, performance or non-performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be
made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto, or, to the extent a party has agreed to cause a Subsidiary to take or
omit to take any action, against such Subsidiary (but only to the extent of
the specific obligations of such parties or Subsidiaries set forth herein).
Without limiting any rights any party may have pursuant to any Transaction
Document against the parties to such Transaction Document, (i) no Person who
is not a named party to the this Agreement (other than the Subsidiaries of a
party to the extent a party has agreed to cause such Subsidiary to take or
omit to take any action), including any past, present or future, director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder or other
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, financial advisor or representative
of any named party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have
any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based
upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or Affiliates) for any liability based on, in respect of, by reason of,
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or their
negotiation or execution; and, (ii) to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities against any such
Non-Party Affiliates.

__[ _Signature Page to Share Purchase Agreement_ ] __ _Exhibit A _

 

 _Form of Escrow Agreement_ ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of May 31,
2016, by and among Michael Kors (Europe) B.V., a Dutch private limited
liability company (" _the Buyer_ "), Michael Kors Far East Trading Limited, a
British Virgin Islands company (" _the Seller_ ", and together with the Buyer,
sometimes referred to individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_ "), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").
Capitalized terms used but not defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such
terms in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below); provided the Escrow Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any capitalized terms not defined
herein.

 

WHEREAS, the Seller and the Buyer have entered into a Share Purchase
Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2016 (as amended, modified, supplemented or
restated from time to time, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the
Buyer, Michael Kors (HK) Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong with
limited liability (the " _Company_ "), the Seller and (solely for
the purposes of certain sections specified therein) Sportswear Holdings
Limited, a British Virgin Islands company; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to  _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.5(b)_ of the Purchase
Agreement, the Parties have agreed that the Buyer shall deposit a portion of
the cash consideration under the Purchase Agreement equal to the Escrow
Deposits (as hereinafter defined) (subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein and therein) with Escrow Agent hereunder to hold the Funds (as
hereinafter defined) until the Funds are released in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow Agent as their escrow agent
for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2\. Funds; Investment. (a) The Buyer agrees to deposit _ _ with Escrow Agent
the sum of (i) $52,000,000 (" _Indemnification Escrow Deposit_ ") and (ii)
$47,500,000 (" _PRC Withholding Tax Escrow Deposit_ " and together with the
Indemnification Escrow Deposit, the " _Escrow Deposits_ "). Escrow Agent
shall hold each Escrow Deposit in one or more demand deposit accounts and
invest and reinvest each of (i) the Indemnification Escrow Deposit and the
proceeds thereof (the " _Indemnification Fund_ ") and (ii) the PRC
Withholding Tax Escrow Deposit and the proceeds thereof (the " _PRC
Withholding Tax Fund_ " and together with the Indemnification Fund, the "
_Funds_ ") in a JPMorgan Money Market Deposit Account (" _MMDA_ "), or a
successor investment offered by Escrow Agent; it being understood that no
portion of the Indemnification Fund shall be held in the same account as the
PRC Withholding Tax Fund. MMDAs have rates of interest or compensation that
may vary from time to time as determined by the Escrow Agent. The Parties
recognize and agree that instructions to make any other investment ("
_Alternative Investment_ "), and any instruction to change investments must
be in a joint writing and executed by an Authorized Representative (as defined
in Section 3 below), of the Buyer and the Seller and shall specify the type
and identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent
is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through
the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of
any affiliated entity and the Escrow Agent or any affiliated entity may act as
counterparty with respect to such investments.

(b) The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with
respect to any Alternative Investment directed hereunder including without
limitation charging any applicable agency fee or trade execution fee in
connection with each transaction. Escrow Agent will not provide supervision,
recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in
the Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any
investment described herein, and each Party acknowledges that it was not
offered any advice or recommendation by Escrow Agent with regard to
any investment and has made an independent assessment of the suitability for
its own purposes of any investment hereunder. Market values, exchange rates
and other valuation information (including without limitation, market value,
current value or notional value) of any Alternative Investment furnished in
any report or statement may be obtained from third party sources and is
furnished for the exclusive use of the Parties. Escrow Agent has no
responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value  of any Alternative Investment and makes no representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any
values necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be received on the sale of
an Alternative Investment. Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any
loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to
its maturity or for the failure of an Authorized Representative of the Parties
to give Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Funds. Escrow
Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to
provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement. The
Parties hereto agree to treat the Buyer as the owner of any amount remaining
in the Funds for all income tax purposes. Accordingly, all interest or other
income earned under this Agreement shall be allocated to the Buyer and
reported, by Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, on IRS
Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the
Escrow Deposits by the Buyer whether or not said income has been distributed
during such year. The Parties shall duly complete such tax documentation
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent as necessary for Escrow Agent to
complete required tax reporting and for the relevant Party to receive
interest or other income without or at a reduced rate of withholding or
deduction of tax in any jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by applicable
law. Should any information supplied by a Party in such tax documentation
change, the applicable Party shall promptly notify Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent
shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the absence of proper tax
documentation as required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities. The Escrow Agent shall distribute, on or before
tenth (10th) calendar day of each calendar year, so long as any portion of the
Escrow Deposits remains in the Funds, to an account or accounts designated by
Buyer in writing, an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the income
earned on the investment of the Funds during the preceding calendar year (or
the balance of the Funds if such amount is less than 25% of the income earned
on the investment of the Funds in the preceding calendar year).

3\. Disposition and Termination. (a) The Escrow Agent shall release amounts
from the Funds only in accordance with (A) joint written instructions
received from the Seller and the Buyer substantially in the form of _Exhibit
A-1_ attached hereto (" _Joint Release Notice_ ") executed by each Party as
evidenced by the signatures of such Partys respective Authorized
Representative, which joint written instructions shall specify the Fund from
which such release shall be made and the party and account to whom such
release shall be paid or (B) a final award, judgment or court order of a
court of competent jurisdiction (" _Court Order_ ") delivered by one of the
Parties to the Escrow Agent and accompanied by written instruction from an
Authorized Representative of such Party to effect such Court Order and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such instructions and shall
have no responsibility to review the Court Order to which such instruction
refers or to make any determination as to whether such Court Order is final.
Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Escrow Agent
receives such an executed Joint Release Notice or a Court Order, the Escrow
Agent shall disburse the portion of the Funds set forth in the Joint Release
Notice or the Court Order, as applicable, to the persons or accounts
designated in such Joint Release Notice or Court Order, as applicable

Whenever Escrow Agent is required to make payment of the Funds pursuant to
this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within 3
Business Days) pay such amount in cash by wire transfer in immediately
available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 8, any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to,
or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of the Funds, must be in
writing executed by the appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by
the signatures of the person or persons signing this Agreement or one of
their designated persons as set forth on the Designation of Authorized
Representatives attached hereto as Schedules 1-A and 1-B (each an "
_Authorized Representative_ "), and delivered to Escrow Agent only by
confirmed facsimile or as a Portable Document Format ("PDF") attached to an
email on a Business Day only at the fax number or email address set forth in
Section 8 below. Each Designation of Authorized Representatives shall be
signed by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or other duly authorized
officer of the named Party. No instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Funds shall be deemed delivered and effective unless
Escrow Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by facsimile or
as a PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set
forth in Section 8 and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the Partys
or Parties transmitting fax number or email address and Escrow Agent has been
able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required
hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person
for refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to the
transfer or distribution of the Funds if delivered to any other fax number or
email address, including but not limited to a valid email address of any
employee of Escrow Agent.

 



2 The Parties each acknowledge that Escrow Agent is authorized to use the
following funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to the Buyer
and/or the Seller, respectively, without a verifying call-back as set forth in
Section 3(b) below:

Additionally, the Parties agree that repetitive funds transfer instructions
may be given to Escrow Agent for one or more beneficiaries where only the
date of the requested transfer, the amount of funds to be transferred, and/or
the description of the payment shall change within the repetitive instructions
(" _Standing Settlement Instructions_ "). Any such Standing Settlement
Instructions shall be set up in writing in advance of any actual transfer
request and shall contain complete funds transfer information (as set forth
above) for the beneficiary. Any such set-up of Standing Settlement
Instructions (other than those established concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement), and any changes in existing set-up, shall be confirmed by
means of a verifying callback to an Authorized Representative. Standing
Settlement Instructions will continue to be followed until cancelled by the
Parties jointly in a writing signed by an Authorized Representative of each
Party and delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section. Once set
up as provided herein, Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing
Settlement Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for
each beneficiary. Each Party agrees that any Standing Settlement Instructions
shall be effective as the funds transfer instructions of such Party or
the Parties, as applicable, without requiring a verifying callback, as set
forth in Section 3(b) below, if such Standing Settlement Instructions are
consistent with previously authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions for
that beneficiary.

 

(b) In the event any other funds transfer instructions are set forth in a
permitted instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with Section
3, Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such funds transfer
instructions by a single telephone call-back to one of the Authorized
Representatives of such Party or Parties, as the case may be, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be that Authorized
Representative. The persons designated as Authorized Representatives and
telephone numbers for same may be changed only in a writing executed by an
Authorized Representative or other duly authorized officer of the applicable
Party setting forth such changes and actually received by Escrow Agent via
facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email. Except as set forth in Section
3(a) above, no funds will be disbursed until an Authorized Representative is
able to confirm such instructions by telephone callback. Escrow Agent, any
intermediary bank and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely
upon the identifying number of the beneficiarys bank or any intermediary
bank included in a funds transfer instruction provided by a Party or the
Parties in accordance with Section 3 and confirmed by an Authorized
Representative of such Party or Parties. Further, the beneficiarys bank in
the funds transfer instruction may make payment on the basis of the account
number provided in such Party or Parties instruction and confirmed by an
Authorized Representative of such Party or Parties even though it identifies a
person different from the named beneficiary.

 



3 (c) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the internet and the Parties hereby expressly assume such
risks.

 

(d) As used in this Section 3, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which Escrow Agent located at the
notice address set forth below is authorized or required by law or executive
order to remain closed. The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures
set forth in this Section 3 are commercially reasonable.

 

(e) Upon delivery of the Funds in full by Escrow Agent, this Agreement shall
terminate and the related account(s) shall be closed, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.

4\. Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are
specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any
fiduciary duty, shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any
obligation to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement
between the Parties, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any
Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any
other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control the actions of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may
conclusively rely upon any written notice, document, instruction or request
delivered by the Parties reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without
inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind and Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity,
accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request.
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to
be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that Escrow Agents gross
negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud was the cause of any
direct loss to either Party. Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents,
provided that Escrow Agent shall be liable for any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of its affiliates or agents hereunder. In the event Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity, as to its
duties or rights hereunder, or receives instructions, claims or demands from
any Party hereto which in Escrow Agents judgment conflict with the
provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from the Parties, Escrow Agent shall be entitled either to: (a)
refrain from taking any action until it shall be given (i) a joint written
direction executed by Authorized Representatives of the Parties which
eliminates such conflict or (ii) a court order issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction (it being understood that Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely and act upon any such court order and shall have no
obligation to determine whether any such court order is final); or (b) file an
action in interpleader. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any
payments which may be due it or the Funds, including, without limitation, the
Escrow Deposits nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to
confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it
hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

5\. Resignation; Succession. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from
its duties or obligations hereunder by giving not less than thirty (30) days
advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties or may be
discharged from its duties and obligations and removed as escrow agent, with
or without cause, by the Parties at any time after giving no less than thirty
(30) days advance joint written notice to the Escrow Agent. Escrow Agents
sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be
to hold the Funds (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver
the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the
Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or to distribute it
in accordance with the directions of a final non-appealable court order, at
which time of delivery or distribution, Escrow Agents obligations hereunder
shall cease and terminate. If prior to the effective resignation or removal
date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent, or to
instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Funds to another person as provided
above, or if such delivery is contrary to applicable law, at any time on or
after the effective resignation date, Escrow Agent either (a) may interplead
the Funds with a court located in the State of New York and the reasonable and
documented expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in
connection with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the
Funds; or (b) appoint a successor escrow agent of its own choice. Any

 



4  appointment of a successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties
and no appointed successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of
Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall deliver the Funds to any appointed successor
escrow agent, at which time Escrow Agents obligations under this Agreement
shall cease and terminate. Any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all of the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

 

6\. Compensation; Acknowledgment. (a) The Parties each agree to pay Escrow
Agent upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter
reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which
unless otherwise agreed in writing, shall be as described in Schedule 2. The
Seller and the Buyer shall each be responsible for 50% of any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 6.2(a).

(b) Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set
forth in Schedule 2.

 

7\. Indemnification and Reimbursement. The Parties agree jointly and severally
to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse Escrow Agent and its
affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and
employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements,
litigation, investigations, or reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs
or expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees
and expenses of outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all
reasonable and documented expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively " _Losses_ "), arising out of or in connection with
(a) Escrow Agents performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that
such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been
caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud of such
Indemnitee and (b) Escrow Agents following, accepting or acting upon any
instruction or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties
received in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that as between
themselves, and without affecting their indemnification obligations to the
Escrow Agent, each of the Buyer and the Seller agrees to pay fifty percent
(50%) of any such indemnification claims and shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the other Party to the extent the amount of Losses paid to
an Indemnitee exceeds such agreed to fifty percent (50%) allocation. The
obligations set forth in this Section 7 shall survive the resignation,
replacement or removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

8\. Notices. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, all communications
hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an email, and
all instructions from a Party or the Parties to the Escrow Agent shall be
executed by an Authorized Representative, and shall be delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement by facsimile, email or overnight
courier only to the appropriate fax number, email address, or notice address

9\. Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that a legal garnishment,
attachment, levy restraining notice or court order is served with respect to
any of the Funds, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an
order of a court, Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its
reasonable discretion, to obey and comply with all such orders so entered or
issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and to the extent that Escrow
Agent obeys or complies with any such order it shall not be liable to any of
the Parties hereto or any other person by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such order being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled,
set aside or vacated.

 

10\. Miscellaneous. (a) The provisions of this Agreement may be waived,
altered, amended or supplemented only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent
and the Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder
may be assigned by any Party without the prior consent of Escrow Agent and the
other Party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws
of the State of New York. Each Party and Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any
objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds
and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner
permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the State of New York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction
either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its
assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment)
or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and hereby irrevocably
waives, such immunity. Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby waive any
right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding
arising or relating to this Agreement. No party to this Agreement is liable to
any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its
obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire,
war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission
failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Agreement and any
Joint Release Notice from the Parties may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument or instruction, as
applicable. All signatures of the parties to this Agreement may be transmitted
by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email, and such facsimile or PDF
will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party
whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any
provision of this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable
by reason of any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall,
as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.
The Parties each represent, warrant and covenant that (i) each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall
comply with applicable laws and regulations; (ii) such Party has full power
and authority to

 



6  enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform all of the
duties and obligations to be performed by it hereunder; and (iii) the
person(s) executing this Agreement on such Partys behalf and certifying
Authorized Representatives in the applicable Schedule 1 have been duly and
properly authorized to do so, and each Authorized Representative of such Party
has been duly and properly authorized to take the actions specified for such
person in the applicable Schedule 1. Except as expressly provided in Section 7
above, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
construed to give to any person or entity other than Escrow Agent and
the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or
in respect of the Funds or this Agreement.

 

(b) Information. The Parties authorize the Escrow Agent to disclose
information with respect to this Agreement and the account(s) established
hereunder, the Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such disclosure is:
(i) necessary or desirable, in the Escrow Agents opinion, for the purpose of
allowing the Escrow Agent to perform its duties and to exercise its powers
and rights hereunder; (ii) to a proposed assignee of the rights of Escrow
Agent; (iii) to a branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of the
Escrow Agent or to their auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any
competent court; (iv) to the auditors of any of the Parties; or (v) permitted
or required by applicable law, regardless of whether the disclosure is made in
the country in which each Party resides, in which the Escrow Account is
maintained, or in which the transaction is conducted. The Parties agree that
such disclosures by the Escrow Agent and its affiliates may be transmitted
across national boundaries and through networks, including those owned by
third parties.
