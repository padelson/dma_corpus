-22- 

 



    



   



  

5.2 _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
"), including supporting documentation, containing the Company's (i) good

Transaction Expenses and (ii) calculation of the Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount (based on the Company's good faith estimates of the Closing
Company Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses) (the " _Estimated
Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and be based
upon the books and records of the Company and other information then
available. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in its review of the
Estimated Closing Statement and consider in good faith any reasonable changes
thereto that Parent may suggest.

  



  

5.3 _Final Closing Statement_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a reasonably
detailed statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") containing its final
determination of the Closing Company Indebtedness and Company Transaction
Expenses and its final calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment
Amount based on such final determination, including such schedules and data
as may be reasonably necessary to support such determinations. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall provide the Stockholder Representative and its
Representatives with the opportunity to review all work papers and
documentation used by Parent in preparing the Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) If the Stockholder Representative objects to Parent's
determination of the Closing Company Indebtedness or Company
Transaction Expenses, as reflected in the Final Closing Statement, the
Stockholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such objection(s)
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final Closing Statement from the
Surviving Corporation (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The Objection Notice shall
specify the items or amounts contained in the Final Closing Statement that are
being disputed and describe in reasonable detail the basis for such disputes,
including the Stockholder Representative's calculation of any such amounts.

  



  

(c) If the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice
with respect to one or more items in the Final Closing Statement
in accordance with Section 5.3(b), then the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such disputed items.

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent and the Stockholder Representative
are unable to resolve the disputed items within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Objection Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder
Representative may demand that such disputed items be referred to an
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing as is mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative to finally resolve
such disputed items. The independent accounting firm shall act as an expert
and not an arbitrator, and shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Final Closing Statement as to which the Stockholder Representative has
disagreed and shall not assign a value to any such item or amount that is (i)
greater than the greatest value for such item or amount assigned by Parent in
the Final Closing Statement, on the one hand, or the Stockholder
Representative in the Objection Notice, on the other hand or (ii) less than
the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by Parent in the Final
Closing Statement, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative in the
Objection Notice, on the other hand. The determination of such
independent accounting firm shall be made as promptly as possible and shall
be final and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder Representative, absent
manifest error. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted
to submit such data and information to such independent accounting firm as
such parties deem appropriate. Parent and the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of the Holders, shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this Section. All expenses and fees of the independent accounting firm
shall be borne in accordance with the percentage of the aggregate disputed
amounts awarded to Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Holders, on the other hand, as a result of
such accounting firm's decision.

  



  

   

-23-

 



    



  

(e) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, and shall
cause their respective accountants to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement and the calculation of the Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount and in the conduct of reviews referred to in
this Section 5.3, including making available, to the extent reasonably
necessary, books, records, work papers and personnel, subject to the
execution of a customary confidentiality agreement with respect thereto.

  



  

(f) The Closing Company Indebtedness and Company Transaction
Expenses as determined pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be used
to determine the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount in accordance
with Section 5.1. For purposes of this agreement,  " _Final Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount_ " means the Merger Consideration Adjustment
Amount (x) as shown in Parent's Final Closing Statement, if no Objection
Notice with respect thereto is duly and timely delivered pursuant to Section
5.3(b), or (y) if an Objection Notice is duly and timely delivered, (A) as
agreed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative or (B) in the absence of
such agreement, as shown in the independent accounting firm's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 5.3(d). Once the Final Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount is determined in accordance with Section 5.1
and this Section 5.3, the following shall occur:

  



  

(i) if the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, (A) the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent in writing the Stockholder
Representative's determination of the portion of such excess payable to each
Holder in accordance with such Holder's Pro Rata Share, (B) Parent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Holders, an amount in
cash equal to the amount by which the Estimated Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount,
and (C) following delivery of such written notice by the Stockholder
Representative, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in accordance with
the Paying Agent Agreement, to each Holder entitled to receive a portion of
such excess, the amount set forth in such notice ( _provided_ , _that_ (x)
the aggregate amount payable to all Holders pursuant to this Section
5.3(f)(i) shall not exceed the excess of the Estimated Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount over the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount and
(y) the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.3(f)(i) that are payable
with respect to any Company Equity Award shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall pay over such
amounts to the Holders of such Company Equity Awards through the payroll
system of the Surviving Corporation on the first administratively practicable
payroll date thereafter, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments); or

  



  

   

-24-

 



    



  

(ii) if the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount exceeds
the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, the Escrow Agent shall,
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, within three (3) Business Days
of the determination of the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, pay
or cause to be paid such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account designated in writing by Parent from the Escrow Funds
( _provided_ , _that_ the aggregate amount payable to Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.3(f)(ii) shall not exceed the Escrow Amount).

  



  

(g) The Stockholder Representative shall revise the Spreadsheet to
reflect any changes to the amounts reflected thereon resulting from changes
in the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount (as compared to the
Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount) and shall provide such
revised Spreadsheet to Parent promptly (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days) following the determination of the Final Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(h) All payments made by Parent to the Holders pursuant to Section
5.3(f)(i), and all payments made to Parent by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 5.3(f)(ii), shall be treated as adjustments to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes.

  



  

5.4 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Stockholder:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares and Company Preferred Shares_.
Each Company Share (other than Company Restricted Shares, which are the
subject of Section 5.5(b)) and each Company Preferred Share, in each case,
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, or
Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case
not held on behalf of third parties (the Company Shares and Company Preferred
Shares referred to in this clause (i), the "Excluded Shares"), and (ii)
Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares that are owned by Stockholders
("Dissenting Stockholders") who have properly made and not withdrawn a demand
for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the Company Shares
and Company Preferred Shares referred to in this clause (ii), the "Dissenting
Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time, all of the Company Shares (other than
Company Restricted Shares, which are the subject of Section 5.5(b)) and
Company Preferred Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Company Share and each Company
Preferred Share (other than Dissenting Shares, Excluded Shares and Company
Restricted Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Holder of such
Excluded Share, shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  



  

(c) _Cancellation of Dissenting Shares_. Each Dissenting Share,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Holder of
such Dissenting Share, shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to
any rights of the Dissenting Stockholders under Section 5.8(e).

  



  

   

-25-

 



    



  

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, any and all
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

  

  



  

5.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each In the Money
Company Option (whether or not vested) shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the Holder thereof, be cancelled and each vested In the
Money Option shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to (i) the Per
Company Option Closing Payment, _plus_ (ii) such additional amounts (if any)
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 5.3(f)(i), Section 5.7(b) or
Section 11.5(a). Promptly following receipt of the applicable funds from the
Paying Agent (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter),
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Option
Holder, in immediately available funds through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation, a cash amount equal to (i) the aggregate Per Company
Option Closing Payments with respect to the vested In the Money Company
Options held by such Holder _minus_ (ii) the Pro Rata Share of the Withheld
Amounts with respect to the vested In the Money Company Options held by such
Holder, _minus_ (iii) the ISO Loan Repayment Amount owed by such Holder,
_minus_ (iv) applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an
exercise price per Company Share that is greater than or equal to the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment.

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. The Paying Agent shall provide
to each Holder of Company Restricted Shares a Letter of Transmittal pursuant
to Section 5.8(b). At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the Holder thereof,
accelerate in full and be cancelled and shall only entitle the Holder of such
Company Restricted Shares to receive (without interest) an amount in cash
(the " _Company Restricted Share Payment_ ") equal to (i) the product of (A)
the number of Company Restricted Shares held by such Holder _multiplied by_
(B) the Per Share Closing Payment, less (ii) applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such product of (A) and (B). Promptly following
receipt of the applicable funds from the Paying Agent (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, subject to receipt of a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal from such Holder, pay to each Holder of

to the applicable Company Restricted Share Payment with respect to the Company
Restricted Shares held by such Holder through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of
directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof shall adopt
any resolutions and take any corporate or other action necessary to effectuate
the provisions of Section 5.5.

Closing Date, on behalf of the Holders, Parent shall withhold from the
Aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Holders and pay to the
Stockholder Representative, an amount in cash equal to the Stockholder
Representative Expenses Holdback Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by the Stockholder Representative in
writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to be
held and used by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of
Section 11.5. The portion of the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback
Amount deposited on behalf of each Holder shall be equal to such Holder's Pro
Rata Share of the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount.

  



  

5.7 _Escrow Amount_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Amount (together with all accrued interest thereon
and any proceeds thereof, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") shall be deposited by
Parent at Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into
escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to be entered into at
the Closing, by and among Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Annex C_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Funds shall be held for the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending three (3) Business Days following
the determination of the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount

the purpose of paying any amount owed to Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(f)(ii)
in the event the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount.

  

    



  

(b) Immediately after the expiration of the Escrow Period and
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the remaining balance of the Escrow Funds, if any, to
be distributed to the Holders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares of
the Escrow Funds (provided that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
5.7(b) that are payable with respect to any Company Equity Award shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
such amounts to the Holders of such Company Equity Awards through the payroll
system of the Surviving Corporation on the first administratively practicable
payroll date thereafter, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments).

  



  

5.8 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate Acquiom Financial LLC, a Colorado limited liability company,
or another bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholder
Representative, to act as payments administrator (the  " _Paying Agent_ ") in
connection with the Merger. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall enter into a payments administration
agreement with the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), which
shall have customary terms and shall provide that, on the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Holders, an amount
in cash equal to the Aggregate Closing Consideration by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Paying Agent in
writing (the " _Closing Payment Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and
in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent
shall provide to each Stockholder of record as of the Effective Time (other
than Holders of Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in substantially the
form attached hereto as Annex D (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ").

  



   

-27-

 



    

  

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company
Shares, Company Preferred Shares or other equity securities of the Company
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Company Share, Company Preferred Share or other equity
security of the Company is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall (subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 5.8(b)) be cancelled and exchanged for the
amount to which the Holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article V. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares or Company Preferred
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to be exchanged upon due surrender of
the Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, may be issued
to such transferee if such Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares, as
applicable, are properly presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
reasonably evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. The Aggregate Merger Consideration, when deposited with
the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent or the Stockholder Representative, as
applicable, in each case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Shares (including Company Restricted
Shares), Company Preferred Shares and Company Options, other than with
respect to any Holder validly asserting appraisal rights in accordance with
the DGCL.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Closing Payment Fund_. Any portion of the
Closing Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the
Closing Payment Fund) that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders for twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any Stockholder (other than a Holder of Dissenting Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this Section 5.8 shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
upon due surrender of its Company Shares and/or Company Preferred Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former Holder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares and Company Preferred Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Company Shares and/or Company Preferred Shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to the Company Shares and/or Company Preferred Shares held by such
Person, but instead such Person shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Company Shares and/or Company Preferred Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. As of the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease
to exist, and each Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Person shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such Person is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such Person to be paid the fair value of such Person's
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease to exist and such
Dissenting Shares shall be converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (without
interest thereon) as if such Dissenting Shares had never been Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of its receipt of any
demands for appraisal of any Company Shares and/or Company Preferred Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL. The Company, prior to the Effective Time, and the
Surviving Corporation, after the Effective Time, shall have the right in
its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any such demands, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be withheld in
Parent's sole and absolute discretion), voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

  



  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations thereunder, or
any other applicable provision of any Law relating to Taxes; _provided_ that,
except with respect to amounts that are compensatory or required to be
withheld as a result of the failure to deliver the certificate contemplated
by Section 3.1(d), prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the
applicable withholding entity shall provide notice to the Holder of the
amounts subject to withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such Holder
to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from
withholding Tax. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the deducting or
withholding Person to the applicable Governmental Entity as required pursuant
to applicable Law, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

5.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Article V
are intended to be for the benefit of, and following the Effective Time they
shall be enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
only by, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Holders, who are
intended third party beneficiaries thereof. The covenants and obligations of
the Stockholder Representative in this Article V are intended to be for the
benefit of, and, following the Effective Time may be enforced against, the
Stockholder Representative by the Holders, who are intended third party
beneficiaries thereof.

  



  

5.10 _Repayment of Credit Facilities_. At least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, if requested by
Parent, have obtained and delivered to Parent from each of the lenders (or
their agent or other representative) in respect of each of the Credit
Facilities a customary "payoff letter" (collectively, the " _Payoff Letters_
") providing, upon receipt of the applicable payoff amounts, that (a) such
Credit Facilities shall have been repaid in full as of the Effective Time and
(b) if any Indebtedness under such Credit Facilities is secured, that all
Liens held by or on behalf of such lenders in respect of the properties and
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such
secured Indebtedness shall have been released.

5.11 _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_. On the Closing
Date, subject to delivery by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date of such information
as may be reasonably required to arrange for the payment of all Company
Transaction Expenses, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all outstanding
Company Transaction Expenses (except for Uruguayan Reorganization Costs) to
be paid in full by wire transfer of immediately available funds to each of
the attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors or other
vendors.

Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the Governing Documents of the Company

bookkeeping practices. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been no change

procedures of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as set forth on
Section 6.1(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Subsidiaries involving the sale of goods or the rendering of services in the
Ordinary Course of Business to Persons that are not Affiliates of the
Company; (B) constitute only valid, undisputed claims of the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries not subject to claims of set-off or other defenses or
counterclaims; and (C) are reflected properly on the books and records of the

Subsidiaries has received written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
other notice indicating that any account debtor does not intend to, or would
not reasonably be expected to have the ability to, pay any material accounts
receivable within ninety (90) days of invoice. Since the date of the Latest

Subsidiaries has been and is consistent with past practices.

Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action described in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b) that, if such action

and no unsatisfied judgments against, or materially and adversely affecting,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, and (C) the Company is not subject to any pending or threatened
Order that does or would be reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(i) Section 6.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
an accurate and complete list of each Company Benefit Plan as of the date of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plan_ "
means all benefit and compensation plans, programs, practices, agreements,
contracts, policies or arrangements, in each case, which is sponsored or
maintained by, or required to be contributed to, or with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ") (whether or not subject to ERISA), and deferred
compensation, employment, change in control, retention, severance, stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and
bonus plans.

  



  

(ii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has
made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, accurate and
complete copies of (1) the Company Benefit Plan document, including any
amendments thereto, (2) a written description of such Company Benefit Plan if
such plan is not set forth in a written document, (3) the most recently
prepared actuarial report, (4) the most recent Form 5500, (5) the
nondiscrimination test results for the three (3) most recently
completed years and (6) a copy of the IRS determination/opinion letter.
Except as would not be reasonably likely to result in material liability,
each Company Benefit Plan (other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")) is in
compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, including, without limitation,
ERISA and the Code (including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code).

  



  

(iii) Each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is
intended to be qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code
has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification or tax exemption of any such ERISA Plan. With respect to any
ERISA Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the

limitation, (A) the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person or entity,
including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin, make unlawful or otherwise prohibit consummation of
such transactions, and (B) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its
willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, product
lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or
interests therein, of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries

Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action is
necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual,
anticipated or threatened (1) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or
(2) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Merger by any Government Antitrust Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that

the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes

of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including,
without limitation, the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking
of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this paragraph (d)) necessary
to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove
such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; and

  



  

(iv) if, following consultation between the parties, there is a
disagreement between the parties about antitrust strategy, Parent's good
faith decision will control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent has the sole right, to be exercised in good faith, to
control and direct antitrust strategy in connection with review by any
Government Antitrust Entity of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any action by, or negotiations with, any Government Antitrust
Entity or other Person relating to the transactions and will take the lead in
all meetings, discussions and communications with any Government Antitrust

individuals having access to, and the number of visits to, it facilities. All
such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

the provisions of this Section 7.5, (iii) create any right to employment,

") to the Company (or its designee) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, at or prior to the time of termination in the case of a termination by
Parent, or as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including
Section 9.2), if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in
which Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee: (i) seeking and

and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Holders, their Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") for

obligations, interest or expenses suffered or incurred by any of the
foregoing that may be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) other than the obligation to pay

and Representatives shall have no further liability or obligation that may be
based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) none of the Seller Parties or any of their
respective Representatives shall have, and the Company, on behalf of the
Seller Parties, expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy
or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based on,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iv) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub, and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives to the Seller Parties and
their respective Representatives that may be based on, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed
the Parent Termination Fee and none of the Seller Parties or any of
their respective Representatives shall seek to recover monetary damages in
excess of such amount. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that in no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section
9.3(b) shall not apply to Section 11.5(f), which shall be enforceable by the
Stockholder Representative in its entirety against the Holders.

  



  

   

-72-

 



    



   



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company and the Holders in the circumstances
in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

Representative; _provided_  that, after the adoption of this Agreement by the
Stockholders of the Company, but prior to the Closing, the parties may amend
this Agreement to the extent permitted by the DGCL (which may, depending on
the nature of such amendment, require further Stockholder approval).

  



  

11.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party to this Agreement may, to the extent legally allowed: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. No
waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty
or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.

11.5 _Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder Representative (x) shall hold the Stockholder
Representative Expenses Holdback Amount in an account segregated from its
corporate funds, (y) shall use the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount solely for the purposes set forth in this Section 11.5 and
not for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and (z) shall
not voluntarily make any portion of the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholder
Representative Expenses Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative
will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Stockholder Representative
Expenses Holdback Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
recover from the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount, prior to
any distribution to the Holders, the Stockholder Representative's out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties under this Agreement
and the agreements ancillary hereto (" _Charges_ "), including, without
limitation, costs and expenses resulting from the employment of financial
advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors and agents assisting in the
assessment of arbitration, litigation and settlement of any disputes arising
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement.
Upon (i) the completion of the Stockholder Representative's responsibilities,
(ii) the disbursement of all of the Escrow Funds, (iii) final resolution of
all disputes arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying
Agent Agreement and (iv) full reimbursement of all Charges of the Stockholder
Representative as provided herein, the Stockholder Representative shall
distribute any remaining portion of the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount (the " _Holdback Distribution Amount_ ") to the Paying Agent
for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares; _provided_ that any Holdback Distribution Amount
corresponding to any Dissenting Shares or any Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares with respect to which the Holders thereof have not claimed
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
5.8(b) prior to the termination of the Closing Payment Fund pursuant to
Section 5.8(d) shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. For tax purposes,
the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Holders at the time of
Closing.

  



  

   

-76- 

 



    



  

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to enforce
and protect the rights and interests of the Holders arising out of or in any
manner relating to this Agreement and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate referred to herein or the transactions provided for
herein, and to take any and all actions which the Stockholder Representative
believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement to enforce and
protect such rights of the Holders, including asserting or pursuing any claim
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the authority or power of the Stockholder Representative to
so act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Stockholder
Representative shall act as it believes to be in the best interests of the
Holders. The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time. If the
Stockholder Representative shall resign or be removed by the Holders, the
Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a majority
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration), within ten (10) days after such
resignation or removal, appoint a successor to the Stockholder
Representative. Any such successor shall succeed the former Stockholder
Representative as the Stockholder Representative hereunder.

  



  

(c) The Stockholder Representative hereby represents and warrants
to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company that: (i) the
Stockholder Representative is a legal entity, validly existing and, in all
material respects, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) the Stockholder Representative has all requisite limited
liability company authority and has taken all limited liability company
action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement and to perform its obligations
thereunder, subject to the laws of agency, (iii) this Agreement has been, and
the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement will be, duly executed and
delivered by the Stockholder Representative and, assuming the valid execution
and delivery by all counterparties hereto, constitutes or, in the case of the
Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, will constitute, a valid and
binding obligation of the Stockholder Representative, enforceable against the
Stockholder Representative in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law), and (iv) the execution, delivery and
performance by the Stockholder Representative of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement does not and will not constitute or
result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or the bylaws or the comparable governing instruments of the
Stockholder Representative.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, each Holder, without any
further action on the part of such Holder, by virtue of such Holder's
approval of the Merger, execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal,
and/or acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, shall be
deemed to have consented to the appointment of the Stockholder Representative
as of the Effective Time as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact for
and on behalf of each such Holder, and the granting to the Stockholder
Representative the full power and authority to represent all of the Holders
with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and any other agreements ancillary
hereto in the sole discretion of the Stockholder Representative, and to do all
things and to perform all acts on behalf of the Holders, including waiving
rights, discharging liabilities and obligations, settling disputes
and actions, making decisions relating to the adjustments to the Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Agreement, and the
disbursement of the Escrow Funds (or any portion thereof) in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and executing and delivering all
agreements, certificates, receipts, notices, instructions and other
instruments contemplated by, or deemed advisable in connection with, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. All actions taken by the
Stockholder Representative hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on each
of the Holders as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of
the Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf of
all of the Holders (i) to interpret all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, (ii) to the
extent expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Paying Agent Agreement, to negotiate and settle disputes arising under, or
relating to, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, (iii) to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement, to
direct the Paying Agent to disburse to the Holders any funds received on
behalf of the Holders under this Agreement or otherwise, (iv) to give all
approvals and take any other actions with respect to the Holders in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement, or (v) after the Effective Time, to consent to
any amendment to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying
Agent Agreement. Any and all decisions and actions by the Stockholder
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Holders, and each Holder
waives the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.
Parent, Merger Sub (before the Effective Time), and the Surviving Corporation
(after the Effective Time) may deal solely with and rely solely on
the Stockholder Representative as the representative of all of the Holders.
Parent, Merger Sub (before the Effective Time), and the Surviving Corporation
(after the Effective Time) shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Holder by the
Stockholder Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any Holder by the Stockholder Representative, as fully
binding on such Holder. This power of attorney and all authority hereby
conferred is granted in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
made herein, and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act
of any one or more Holders or by operation of Law, whether by death or other
event.

  



  

(e) In the event of any pending or threatened action, claim,
dispute or other proceeding related to this Agreement, with respect to
any information that the Stockholder Representative may share with the
Holders, the Stockholder Representative and such Holders will have a
commonality of interest with respect thereto and agree that it is their
intention and understanding that sharing of information will not waive or
diminish the continued protection of the attorney-client privilege, the work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege or doctrine.

  



  

   

-78- 

 



    



  

(f) The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability of any
kind with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholder Representative
in connection with the Stockholder Representative's services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Holders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any
such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Holders the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to
the Stockholder Representative by the Holders, any such Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount and (ii) any other funds
that become payable to the Holders under this Agreement at such time as such
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Holders; provided, that while
this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered
or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Holders set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the
Stockholder Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities will
survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) The provisions of this Section 11.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Holders, who are intended third
party beneficiaries hereof.

  



  

11.6 _Attorney Client Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees to comply with the provisions of this Section
11.6 and, following the Closing, agrees to cause Parent's
controlled Affiliates and Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) (collectively with Parent, the " _Parent Parties_ ") to
comply with the provisions of this Section 11.6 and to execute and deliver any
documents or agreements reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative to implement such provisions.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any representation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by Stinson LLP (" _Stinson_ ") prior to the Closing Date,
each Parent Party:

  



  

(i) consents to Stinson's representation of the Stockholder
Representative in connection with any matters or disputes arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;

  



  

   

-79- 

 



    



  

(ii) waives any claim it has or may have that Stinson has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such a
representation described in clause (i) based upon Stinson's prior
representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(iii) agrees that, if a dispute arises between any Holder, on the
one hand, and any Parent Party, on the other hand, with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, Stinson may represent such Holder
notwithstanding that the interests of such Holder and such Parent Party may
be directly adverse and that Stinson may have represented the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in a substantially related matter.

  



  

(c) As to all communications prior to the Closing that reasonably
relate to this Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and that are (x) privileged
communications between Stinson or another legal advisor, on the one hand,
and, prior to the Closing, any Holder or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or (y) communications that refer or relate
to such privileged communications (collectively, " _Confidential
Communications_ "), each Parent Party agrees that, in the context of any
dispute described in clause (b)(i) above, the attorney-client
privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to the applicable
Holder, may be controlled by such Holder and will not pass to or be claimed
by any Parent Party. Each Parent Party will not assert that privilege has been
waived with respect to Confidential Communications coming into the possession
of such Parent Party merely as a result of the Merger. To the extent that any
Parent Party has or maintains any control of such privilege of such
Confidential Communications, such Parent Party will not, except as may be
required by applicable Law, waive or attempt to waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that, following the Closing, a dispute arises
between any Parent Party and a third party (other than a Holder, but
including any Governmental Entity), such Parent Party may assert the attorney-
client privilege against such third party to the extent necessary to prevent
disclosure of Confidential Communications. Each Parent Party will take
reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential
Communications.

  



  

11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, including electronic counterparts, each such counterpart
being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall
together constitute the same agreement.

11.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction;_ _ WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all
respects shall be governed by, interpreted and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of DELAWARE, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION OR WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO another JURISDICTION. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction
over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the District of
Delaware (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in the Chosen Courts and any appellate court from any
thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts and any
appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in
the Chosen Courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.4. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.8(b).

  



  

11.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other(s)
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other(s) (as
applicable) under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections
to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such
party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

  



  

   

-81- 

 



    



  

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

  



  

11.11 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other
document, instrument or other agreement contemplated by or referred to herein
or delivered in connection herewith, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that (a) no Person other than the parties hereto has any obligations under
this Agreement; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder
Representative's obligations under this Agreement are solely with respect to
the provisions hereof that apply to the Stockholder Representative, (b)
except claims for Fraud, this Agreement may be enforced only against, and any
claims, obligations, liabilities or other causes of action (whether at Law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out or by
reason of, or related in any manner to a breach of this Agreement (including
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement), or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement, by the Company may be made only
against the Company, and (c) except claims for Fraud, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, their respective Affiliates or their
respective Affiliates' directors or officers have a right of recovery for any
claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether at Law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out or by
reason of, or related in any manner to a breach of this Agreement (including
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement), or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement, against, and except for claims
against the Person for Fraud, no liability shall attach to, any of the
Company's or its Affiliates' respective current, former or future
equity holders, incorporators, controlling Persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or Representatives (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the
foregoing) (each, a  " _Non-Party Affiliate_ "), including any right of
recovery in respect of this Agreement against any Non-Party Affiliate that
may be granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the corporate veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or otherwise, this Section 11.11 shall not apply to Section 11.5,
which shall be enforceable by the Stockholder Representative in its entirety
against the Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or otherwise, no party may seek to rescind this Section 11.11
after the Closing.

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
Section 5.9 ( _Third Party Beneficiaries_ ), Section 7.6 ( _Indemnification;
Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_), Section 11.5 ( _Stockholder
Representative_ ) and Section 11.6 ( _Attorney Client Matters_ ), Parent and
the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

  



  

11.13 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires any Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause any such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause any such
Subsidiary to take such action.

  



  

11.14 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of
financial advisors, financial sponsors, legal counsel and other advisors,
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

  



  

11.15 _Transfer Taxes_. Except to the extent constituting
Uruguayan Reorganization Costs, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due, and Parent and Merger Sub will indemnify the Company against
liability for any such Taxes.

  



  

11.16 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

11.17 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by any
party hereto, except, in the case of Parent or Merger Sub: (a) prior to
the Effective Time, with the consent of the Company, (b) after the Effective
Time, to one of Parent's Affiliates or otherwise with the consent of the
Stockholder Representative, (c) after the Effective Time, in connection with
the sale of substantially all of the assets of Parent or substantially all of
the assets associated with one or more of Parent's business lines

Parent's financing sources, or (e) prior to the Closing, by written notice to
the Company, to another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
constituent corporation in the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event
all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation;  _provided_ that any such designation shall

11.18 _Guarantee_.

  



  

(a) The Ultimate Parent Entity agrees to take all action necessary
to cause Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform all of
their respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement on
a timely basis. The Ultimate Parent Entity does hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantee to the Company the full, complete and prompt performance
and payment, as the case may be, of the Guaranteed Obligations (as
hereinafter defined), and undertakes with the Company that, whenever
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation does not pay or perform any
of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with their respective terms, the
Ultimate Parent Entity shall, immediately on demand by the Company, pay or
perform such Guaranteed Obligations as if the Ultimate Parent Entity were the
principal obligor primarily liable for the performance thereof and not as a
mere surety. The Company may obtain recourse against the Ultimate Parent
Entity for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations prior
to, concurrently with, or after any other Legal Proceeding to enforce such
Guaranteed Obligations. In no event shall the Company be deemed to have
elected any remedy that precludes or impairs its ability to proceed against
the Ultimate Parent Entity hereunder. The Ultimate Parent Entity hereby
waives protest, presentment, demand for payment and notice of default or
nonpayment. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Ultimate Parent Entity may not assign or transfer its
obligations hereunder to any other Person without the prior written consent
of the Company. The Ultimate Parent Entity shall be entitled to perform or
satisfy the Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to the same terms and conditions
and subject to the same rights and limitations as are applicable to Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Guaranteed Obligations" means any and all
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to the extent
such obligations arise under this Agreement. Immediately following the making
of the payments required by Section 3.2 and Section 5.3, the provisions of
this Section 11.18 shall automatically terminate and the Ultimate Parent
Entity shall have no further obligation hereunder.

deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has

and binding agreement of the Ultimate Parent Entity, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The
Ultimate Parent Entity hereby makes the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 6.2(c) with respect to itself. The Ultimate Parent Entity
