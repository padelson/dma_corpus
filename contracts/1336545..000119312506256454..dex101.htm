described in Section 1.11. All of the shares of capital stock of AAI and each
CI company and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall be referred to

4 (b) _Net Debt and Reduction of Amount of Transaction Shares._

(i) If the Companys Net Debt (as defined) at the close of business on the
date two business days prior to the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Net Debt_
") is more than $110,000,000 as determined in accordance with this Agreement,
the number of Transaction Shares to be issued at the Closing shall be reduced
by that number of shares equal to the Net Debt Transaction Share Reduction
Number. The Company shall not incur and debt, other than in the ordinary
course of business during the period from the date two business days prior to
the Closing Date and the Closing Date.

(ii) The term " _Net Debt Transaction Share Reduction Number_ " shall mean the
quotient derived by dividing (i) the difference between the Closing Date Net
Debt and $110,000,000 by (ii) $7.75 (rounded up to the nearest share);
provided, however, that if Closing Date Net Debt is equal to or less than
$110,000,000, the Net Debt Transaction Share Reduction Number shall be zero.

(iii) The term "Net Debt" shall mean the Companys combined indebtedness (
_i.e_., all indebtedness for borrowed money and capitalized leases and
equivalents and other obligations evidenced by promissory notes or similar
instruments, as well as cash overdrafts), less the Companys combined cash and
cash equivalents ( _i.e.,_ all short-term money market instruments and

(iv) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, on the 25th day of each
calendar month, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written statement of the

thereof.

Stock that the beneficial holders of the Company Capital Stock are entitled to
receive as a result of the Business Combination shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or



 

5 distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Capital Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the date of
issuance or payments thereof.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the Business Combination, and each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon

share, one (1) share of Parent Common Stock.

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon surrender of all of the certificates
representing Company Capital Stock (" _Company Certificates_ ") at the
Closing, the holders of such Company Certificates shall receive in exchange
therefor certificates representing the Transaction Shares into which their
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be converted or exchanged at the
Effective Time, less the Escrow Shares. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Company Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Transaction
Shares then issuable under the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Required Withholding_. The Parent and the Surviving Corporations shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Capital Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(c) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.6, neither Parent, U.S. Surviving Corporation, the Company nor any other
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(d) _Canadian Tax Clearance Certificate._  The following provisions apply in
respect of each disposition of the shares of a CI company by CI Stockholders
to Parent or Canadian Newco (the " _Recipient Party_ ") pursuant to this
Agreement:

(i) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 1.6(d), the CI
Stockholders will deliver to Recipient Party a certificate issued pursuant to
section 116 of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (" _Canadian Tax Act_ ") in
respect of the disposition of the shares of the relevant CI company to the
Recipient Party (" _Section 116 Certificate_ "). 



 

6 (ii) If no Section 116 Certificate is delivered to the Recipient Party on or
prior to the Closing Date, the Recipient Party shall withhold 25% of the
portion of the Transaction Shares that is allocable to the acquisition of the
shares of the CI company (such shares hereinafter referred to as the "
_Canadian Shares_ " and such portion hereinafter referred to as the "
_Canadian Allocation"_ ). Such withheld Transaction Shares will be dealt with
as provided for in Section 1.6(d)(iv).

(iii) If a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue pursuant to
subsection 116(2) of the Canadian Tax Act in respect of the sale of the
Canadian Shares to the Recipient Party is delivered to the Recipient Party on
or prior to the Closing Date specifying a certificate limit in an amount less
than the Canadian Allocation, the Recipient Party shall withhold from
the Transaction Shares to be delivered at Closing that number of Transaction
Shares that has a value equal to 25% of the amount by which the Canadian
Allocation exceeds the certificate limit. Such withheld Transaction Shares
will be dealt with as provided for in Section 1.6(d)(iv).

(iv) Any Transaction Shares withheld by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.6(d)(ii) or Section 1.6(d)(iii) (" _Canadian Escrow Shares_ ") shall not be
delivered to the CI stockholder at Closing and shall be held in escrow by
Parent and only dealt with as hereinafter provided.

(v) Subject to Section 1.6(d)(vii), if, prior to the 27th day after the end of
the month in which the Closing Date occurs (" _Due Date_ ") the CI
Stockholder delivers to Recipient Party a Section 116 Certificate, the
Recipient Party will deliver such CI Stockholder the Canadian Escrow Shares
other than that number of Canadian Escrow Shares that has a value equal to
25% of the amount by which the Canadian Allocation exceeds the certificate
limit.

(vi) Subject to Section 1.6(d)(vii), if Recipient Party has withheld
Transaction Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(d)(ii) or Section 1.6(d)(iii) and
the CI stockholder does not deliver to the Recipient Party, prior to the Due
Date, a Section 116 Certificate or delivers a Section 116 Certificate
specifying a certificate limit less than the Canadian Allocation, the
Recipient Party shall remit to the Receiver General of Canada the amount
required to be remitted pursuant to subsection 116(5) of the Canadian Tax Act
and shall provide evidence of such remittance to the CI Stockholder. The
Recipient Party shall cause to be delivered to the CI Stockholder any
remaining portion of the Canadian Escrow Shares.

(vii) The Due Date under Section 1.6(d)(v) and Section 1.6(d)(vi) may be
extended to a later date if the Canada Revenue Agency confirms in writing to
Recipient Party that Recipient Party may continue to hold the Canadian Escrow
Shares without being subject to penalty and interest for late remittance,
provided that a copy of such correspondence is delivered to the
Recipient Party.



 

7 1.7 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Capital Stock and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporations or the Company of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are
presented to Parent or any Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.8 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Company
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the
shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Company
Certificates were converted or exchanged; provided, however, that, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of such cash and certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificates shall indemnify Parent against any claim that
may be made against Parent or U.S. Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations.

1.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest (a) U.S. Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of AAI, LLC and Merger Sub and (b) Parent with the full
right, title and possession to all shares of capital stock of each CI company,
the officers and directors of AAI, LLC and Merger Sub will take all such
lawful and necessary action.



 

8 1.11 _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnity obligations set forth in
Article VII, at the Closing, the Stockholder shall deposit in escrow, to be
held from the Closing Date until the later of (i) the first anniversary of the
Closing Date and (ii) 30 days after Parent has filed with the SEC its annual
report on Form 10-K or 10-KSB for the year ending December 31, 2007 (such
period, the " _Escrow Period_ "), and for such further period as may be
required pursuant to the Escrow Agreement referred to below, an aggregate of
8,064,516 Escrow Shares, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement to be entered into at the Closing between Parent, the
Stockholder and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as escrow agent ("
_Escrow Agent_ "), in the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow

1.12 _Stockholder Matters_.

(a) By his, her or its execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder and each
of the CI Stockholders and Lim, in his, her or its capacity as a
registered or beneficial stockholder of AAI and/or CI, and/or as a member of
LLC, hereby approves and adopts this Agreement and authorizes each of AAI,
each CI company and LLC, its respective directors, managers and officers to
take all actions necessary for the consummation of the Business Combination
and the other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and its exhibits. Such execution shall be deemed to be action taken
by the irrevocable written consent of the Stockholder, the CI Stockholders
and Lim for purposes of the Applicable Corporate Laws. The Stockholder, each
of the CI Stockholders and Lim also confirms that he, she or it is not
entitled to any appraisal, dissenters or similar rights pursuant to the
Applicable Corporate Laws.

(b) The Stockholder and each of the CI Stockholders, severally and not
jointly, represents and warrants as follows: (i) all Parent Common Stock to
be acquired by such Person pursuant to this Agreement will be acquired for
his, her or its account and not with a view towards distribution thereof other
than, with respect to any such Persons that are entities, transfers to its
stockholders, partners or members; (ii) he, she or it understands that he, she
or it must bear the economic risk of the investment in the Parent Common
Stock, which cannot be sold by him, her or it unless it is registered under
the Securities Act, or an exemption therefrom is available thereunder; (iii)
he, she or it has had both the opportunity to ask questions and receive
answers from the officers and directors of Parent and all persons acting
on Parents behalf concerning the business and operations of Parent and to
obtain any additional information to the extent Parent possesses or may
possess such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or
expense necessary to verify the accuracy of such information; and (iv) he,
she or it has had access to the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement. The Stockholder and each of the CI Stockholders acknowledges,
as to himself, herself or itself only, that (v) he, she or it is either (A)
an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated
under the Securities Act or (B) a person possessing sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters to enable it to evaluate the
merits and risks of an investment in Parent; and (vi) he, she or it
understands that the certificates representing the Parent Common Stock to be
received by him, her or it may bear legends to the effect that the Parent
Common Stock may not be transferred except upon compliance with (C) the

and (D) the provisions of this Agreement. Any CI Stockholder that is an
entity, for itself, represents, warrants and acknowledges, with respect to
each holder of its equity interests, to the same effect as the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.12(b).



 

9 (c) The Stockholder, each of the CI Stockholders and Lim, severally and not
jointly, represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of this

agency, commission, governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign
(a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any,
of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("
_Exchange Act_ "), state securities laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ "), and the rules
and regulations thereunder, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.2(a)) on
such Person or the Company or, after the Closing, the Parent, or prevent
consummation of the Business Combination or otherwise prevent the parties
hereto from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

1.13 _Appointed Director for Purposes of Escrow Agreement._ At or prior to the
Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent shall appoint one of its existing
members (" _Appointed Director_ ") who will continue to serve on Parents
board following consummation of the Business Combination under the terms of
the Voting Agreement to act on behalf of Parent and to take all necessary
actions and make all decisions following the Closing pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement regarding Parents rights under Article VII hereof. In the event the
Appointed Director resigns from the Board, he shall have the right to appoint
another member of the Board of Directors of Parent who was a director
of Parent prior to the Closing Date or some other Person who would qualify as
an "independent" director of Parent and who has not had any compensatory
business relationship with the Company prior to the Closing to serve as his
successor in the role of Appointed Director.

1.14 _Certain Registration Rights_. At the Closing, Parent and the Stockholder

aggregate sum of (i) an amount equal to the product of (A) AAIs net taxable
income for the period commencing January 1, 2006 and ending on the date
of Effective Time and (B) the highest combined marginal federal and state tax
rate applicable to individuals residing in the State of California with
respect to such income or gain (taking into account the amount and character
of the income or gain) minus (ii) all previous distributions made by AAI to
the Stockholder and Lim in respect of the 2006 taxable year and the 2007
taxable year, if applicable, prior to the Effective Time (the " _Stub Period
Tax Distribution_ "). The Stub Period Tax Distribution shall be allocated
between the Stockholder and Lim pro ratably with their respective ownership of
AAI (and giving effect to any purchase by the Stockholder of Lims interest in
AAI prior to the Effective Time). The Stub Period Tax Distribution shall not
be deemed to have been made to the Stockholder or Lim in consideration for the
Business Combination and shall not be deemed additional "purchase price" paid
by Parent for the Business Combination.

thereunder, and the calling and holding of the Special Meeting. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall ensure that the Proxy Statement does
not, as of the date on which it is distributed to the holders of Parent Common
Stock, and as of the date of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (provided that Parent shall not be responsible for the
accuracy or completeness of any information relating to the Company or any
other information furnished by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement). The Company represents and warrants that the information relating
to the Company (and the Subsidiaries) supplied by the Company for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will not as of date of its distribution to the holders of
Parent Common Stock (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or at the time of
the Special Meeting contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statement therein not false
or misleading.

(e) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that the holders
of Parent Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Business Combination, and shall otherwise use best efforts
to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.

(f) The Company also shall cooperate with Parent and provide all information
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any application or
other filing made to maintain or secure listing of Parents securities on the
American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, OTC-BB or other exchange or trading market.

5.2 _Directors and Officers of Parent and the Surviving Corporations_. Subject
to limitations imposed under applicable laws, the parties shall take all
necessary actions so that the persons listed in _Schedule 5.2_ (as same shall
be completed prior to Closing) are elected to the positions of officers and
directors of Parent and U.S. Surviving Corporation, effective immediately
after the Closing. The Stockholder and those stockholders of Parent stated to
be parties thereto shall enter into a Voting Agreement in the form of _Exhibit
C_ hereto concurrently with the execution of this Agreement.

5.3 _Public Disclosure_. From the date of this Agreement until Closing or
termination, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to jointly prepare all
press releases and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and
the transactions governed by it, and no party shall issue or otherwise make

transaction without the prior consent of Parent (in the case of the Company
and the Stockholder) or the Company (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub),
except as required by any legal requirement or by the rules and regulations
of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock



 

44 exchange or trading system. Each party will not unreasonably delay, withhold
or condition approval from the others with respect to any press release or
public announcement. If any party determines with the advice of counsel that
it is required to make this Agreement and the terms of the transaction public
or otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with respect
thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making any public disclosure,
consult with the other party regarding such disclosure, seek such confidential
treatment for such terms or portions of this Agreement or the transaction as
may be reasonably requested by the other party and disclose only such
information as is legally compelled to be disclosed. This provision will not
apply to communications by any party to its counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors. 

5.4 _Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Parent will
prepare and file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to
report the execution of this Agreement (" _Signing Form 8-K_ "), which the
Company may review and comment upon prior to filing. Any language included in
such Current Report that reflects the Companys comments, as well as any text
as to which the Company has not commented upon being given a reasonable
opportunity to comment, shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3,
be deemed to have been approved by the Company and may henceforth be used by
Parent in other filings made by it with the SEC and in other documents
distributed by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without further review or consent of the Stockholder or the
Company. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall also issue a press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement (" _Press Release_ ").

(b) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, Parent shall prepare a draft
Form 8-K announcing the Closing, together with, or incorporating by reference,
the financial statements prepared by the Company and such other information
that may be required to be disclosed with respect to the Business Combination
in any report or form to be filed with the SEC (" _Closing Form 8-K_ "),
which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and in a format
acceptable for EDGAR filing. Prior to Closing, Parent and the Company shall
prepare the press release announcing the consummation of the Business
Combination hereunder (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently with the
Closing, Parent shall file the Closing Form 8-K with the SEC and distribute
the Closing Press Release. 

5.5 _Required Information_. In connection with the preparation of the Signing
Form 8-K, Closing 8-K Form 8-K and Press Release, or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent and/or the
Company to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Business Combination or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
for such other reasonable purposes, the Company and Parent each shall, upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
themselves, their respective directors, officers and stockholders (including
the directors of Parent and the Company to be elected effective as of the
Closing pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof) and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Business Combination.
Each party warrants and represents to the other party that all such
information shall be true and correct in all material respects and will not
contain any untrue statement of a



 

45 material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

5.6 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

(a) _Confidentiality_. Any confidentiality agreement previously executed by
the parties shall be superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this
Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence any non-public
information received from the other party, and to use such non-public
information only for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Such confidentiality obligations will not apply to (i)
information which was known to the one party or their respective agents prior
to receipt from the other party; (ii) information which is or
becomes generally known; (iii) information acquired by a party or their
respective agents from a third party who was not bound to an obligation of
confidentiality; and (iv) disclosure required by law. In the event this
Agreement is terminated as provided in Article VIII hereof, each party (i)

other material obtained from the other in connection with the Business
Combination contemplated hereby, and (ii) will use its reasonable best
efforts to delete from its computer systems all documents and other material
obtained from the other in connection with the Business Combination
contemplated hereby.

(b) _Access to Information_.

counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel
of the Company during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of product
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.6 will
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Business Combination.

(ii) Parent will afford the Company and its financial advisors,
underwriters, accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the

pursuant to this Section 5.6 will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Business Combination.



 

46 5.7 _Cashless Exercise of Warrants_. The parties hereto agree that, in
connection with any redemption of Parents outstanding warrants, Parent shall
offer holders thereof the opportunity to exercise such warrants on a cashless
basis.

5.8 _Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder agrees to use

instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its board of directors and each
of AAI and each CI company and its respective board of directors shall, if
any state or provincial takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to the Business Combination, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its best efforts to
enable the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or
the Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock.

(b) Each of the Company, the Stockholder and Parent shall further cooperate
with each other and use their respective best efforts to take or cause to be

consummate the Business Combination or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This obligation shall include, on the part of Parent,
sending a termination letter to Escrow Agent in substantially the form of
Exhibit A attached to the Investment Management Trust Agreement by and

and Parent shall have the right to review and comment on in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to such party, that appear in any filing made with, or written

contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Company, the Stockholder and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(c) Each of the CI Stockholders and Lim shall take such actions and execute
all documents necessary, proper and advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The foregoing obligations shall include providing all

the CI Stockholders shall not, prior to 36 months after the Closing, sell,

_Exhibit D_ hereto executed by such Persons concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement.

5.11 _Certain Claims_.

(a) As additional consideration for the transactions prescribed hereby, each
of the Stockholder, each CI Stockholder and Lim hereby releases and forever
discharges, effective as of the Closing Date, each other and the Company and
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents,
from any and all rights, claims, demands, judgments, obligations, liabilities
and damages, whether accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, and whether
known or unknown arising out of or resulting from such Persons (i) status as
a holder of an equity interest in the Company or any Subsidiary; and (ii)
employment, service, consulting or other similar agreement entered into with
the Company or any Subsidiary prior to Closing to the extent that the basis
for claims under any such agreement that survives the Closing arise prior to
the Closing, provided, however, the foregoing shall not release any
obligations of such Persons set forth in this Agreement or any other

Agreement and any nominee agreements, the " _Stockholders Agreements_ ")
hereby irrevocably waives, solely with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions and the other documents contemplated hereby, any rights he, she

the consummation of the Business Combination. Each such Person also hereby
agrees that each of the Stockholders Agreements shall be immediately and
automatically terminated not later than the date of the Closing and each party
thereto hereby automatically waives, effective as of the Closing and only upon
consummation of the Business Combination, any and all claims and rights
whatsoever that he, she or it may have against any other party thereto with
respect to any matter thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the LLC
Operating Agreement shall not so terminate and shall be restated and amended,
effective as of the Closing Date, in such form and substance as Parent may
determine. All of the waivers, terminations and other actions contemplated by
this Section 5.11(b) shall be referred to collectively in this Agreement as

efforts to require each of its officers, directors, employees, agents and

of Parents public stockholders and that Parent may disburse monies from the
Trust Fund only (a) to Parents public stockholders in the event they elect
to convert their shares into cash in accordance with Parents Charter
Documents and/or the liquidation of Parent or (b) to Parent after it
consummates a business combination. The Company, the Stockholder, each of the
CI Stockholder and Lim further acknowledge that, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or, upon termination of this Agreement,
another business combination, are not consummated by December 15, 2007,
Parent will be obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts being held
in the Trust Fund. Accordingly, the Company, the Stockholder, each of the CI
Stockholders and Lim for themselves and their subsidiaries, affiliated
entities, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, representatives,
advisors and all other associates and affiliates, hereby waive all rights,
title, interest or claim of any kind against Parent and the Merger Sub to
collect from the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by Parent or
the Merger Sub for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or any negotiations, agreements or
understandings with Parent or the Merger Sub (whether in the past, present or
future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund at any time for
any reason whatsoever. This paragraph will survive this Agreement and will not
expire and will not be altered in any way without the express written consent
of Parent.

hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the

merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving

(a) The Stockholder shall exercise his rights under the Lim Option Agreement
prior to Closing of the Business Combination, and shall consummate the
purchase of Lims Company Capital Stock and Company Membership Interests
contemplated thereby (" _Lim Buy Out_ "). Lim and the Stockholder
hereby agree that the Lim Option Agreement shall be deemed amended and
modified as provided in this Section and that the period under which the Lim
Buy Out may occur is hereby extended from May 1, 2007 to the earlier of the
consummation of the Lim Buy Out and termination of this Agreement. In
consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby agreed that, in the event the Lim
Buy Out occurs after May 1, 2007, then, in addition to the $60 million
purchase price provided under the Lim Option Agreement for the purchase all
of Lims Company Capital Stock and Company Membership Interests, the buyer
thereof shall also pay an additional cash price (" _Additional Purchase Price_
") equal to (x) $60 million divided by 365, (2) multiplied by 0.20, (3)
multiplied by the number of days after May 1, 2007 the Lim Buy Out is
consummated. The $60 million purchase price plus any Additional Purchase Price
shall be referred to as the " _Lim Payment Amount_."

(b) Neither Lim nor the Stockholder nor any other party to this Agreement
shall agree to any terms in the Lim Buy Out that would adversely affect the
other terms of this Agreement or the ability of any party to otherwise
consummate the Business Combination as contemplated by this Agreement.

entered into in connection with the Lim Buy Out, including any
financing agreements, prior to executing same and Parent and counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. The Stockholder shall
promptly provide Parent with all information reasonably requested by Parent
with respect to the status of the Lim Buy Out and the arrangement of
financing with respect thereto.

(d) In the event that the Lim Buy Out is not consummated by the Stockholder
prior to Closing for any reason, Parent shall affect the Lim Buy Out as part
of and conditioned upon the consummation of the Business Combination by
reducing the number of Transaction Shares by the number equal to the Lim
Payment Amount divided by $7.75 and paying to Lim the Lim Payment Amount in
cash for the surrender of his Company Capital Stock and Company Membership
Interests in the Business Combination and the related transactions and such
cash payment shall be deemed part of the consideration paid by Parent for the
Business Combination. In such event, Lim agrees to immediately surrender his
shares in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination
concurrently with his receipt of the Lim Payment Amount. 



 

56 (e) In connection with the consummation of the Lim Buy Out, the Company and
Parent shall cause Lim to be released from any and all personal guarantees
made or given by him on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and
Lim shall otherwise be afforded all releases provided for under the Lim Option
Agreement.

terminated, sell or transfer any Company Capital Stock or Company
Membership Interests to any party other than the Stockholder or Parent as
contemplated hereby or cause any Lien to be placed thereon.

the Lim Option Agreement that may currently exist or arise after the date
hereof and prior to the earlier of the Closing and termination of this
Agreement is waived and suspended until such time as the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated. Each of the Stockholder and Lim agrees that he will not terminate
or cause a termination of the Lim Option Agreement prior to the earlier of
the Closing of the Business Combination and the termination of this
Agreement.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Lim
Option Agreement and without in any way contradicting, modifying or
restricting the nature and extent of the express obligations of a party hereto
contained in this Section 5.28 and Lims right to seek the full extent
of damages in the event of a breach, neither Parent nor the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof shall be obligated to indemnify Lim or hold him harmless
for any liability existing or arising from any circumstances existing prior to
the Lim Buy Out. 

5.29 _Hiring of Certain Officers_. As soon as practicable after execution of
this Agreement, Parent, the Company and Stockholder shall cooperate and use
their best efforts to search for and hire a Chief Operating Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer of Parent. The persons hired
to fill each such office shall be reasonably mutually acceptable to each of
Parent and the Company and each such person must be qualified to hold such
office in a publicly-owned and publicly-reporting company.

5.30 _Section 116 Filing_. As soon as practicable after execution of this
Agreement, Parent, the Company and the Stockholder shall cause to be prepared
and filed all necessary documents and applications necessary to obtain
the Section 116 Certificate. The cost of preparation and filing of same shall
be shared equally by the parties. Any tax liabilities, penalties or interest

Effective Time, but only to the extent of the Escrow Shares, from and against
all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by any
Parent Indemnitee by reason of, arising out of or resulting from:

arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of
investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,
proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether or
not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose of determining
the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any breach) for which
Parent Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VII,
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified
by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification and without
giving effect to such words.

7.2 _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The indemnification obligations
and liabilities under this Article VII with respect to actions, proceedings,
lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims brought against Parent by a
Person other than the Company (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions:

(a) _Notice of Claim_. Parent, acting through the Appointed Director, will
give the Stockholder prompt written notice after receiving written notice of
any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts giving
rise to such Third Party Claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") which Notice of
Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the nature of the
Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-pocket Loss
or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses which have
been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and (iii) whether
such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any insurance and the
estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under such insurance, and
the Stockholder shall be entitled to participate in the defense of Third Party
Claim at its expense.

(b) _Defense_. The Stockholder shall have the right, at its option (subject to
the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) and at its own expense,
by written notice to Parent, to assume the entire control of, subject to the
right of Parent to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice)
in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which
such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a
recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent to be the
lead counsel in connection with such defense. If the Stockholder is permitted
and elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim:

(i) the Stockholder shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third Party
Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of such
defense; provided, however, that Parent shall have the right to approve any
settlement, which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or
conditioned; and



 

64 (ii) Parent shall cooperate fully in all respects with the Stockholder in any
such defense, compromise or settlement thereof, including, without
limitation, the selection of counsel, and Parent shall make available to the

entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against Parent; or (iii) there is a
reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may materially and adversely
affect Parent other than as a result of money damages or other money payments.

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to provide
copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant available data
shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any Third Party Claim
by Parent against the Stockholder and shall not affect the Stockholders duty
or obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the
extent that) such failure shall have adversely affected the ability of the
Stockholder to defend against or reduce its liability or caused or increased
such liability or otherwise caused the damages for which the Stockholder is
obligated to be greater than such damages would have been had Parent given the
Stockholder prompt notice hereunder. So long as the Stockholder is defending
any such action actively and in good faith, Parent shall not settle such
action. Parent shall make available to the Stockholder all relevant records
and other relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under
the control of Parent, for the use of the Stockholder and its representatives
in defending any such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable
cooperation in such defense.

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Stockholder, promptly after receiving a Notice
of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in good faith,
Parent will (upon further written notice) have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim as it may
determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the Stockholder shall
have the right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be
unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned.

(f) _Parent s Rights_. Anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Stockholder shall not, without the written consent of
Parent, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or the plaintiff to Parent of a full and unconditional release
from all liability and obligation in respect of such action without any
payment by Parent.

(g) _Stockholder Consent_. Unless the Stockholder has consented to a
settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the settlement shall not be
a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and such amount shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement



 

65 7.3 _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by insurance, Parent
shall use best efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance;
provided that Parent shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such Losses and the time
limitations set forth in Section 7.4 hereof for bringing a claim of
indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of
such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by Parent for monies from an
insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not, however,
delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein
and otherwise determined to be due and owing by the Stockholder. If Parent
has received the payment required by this Agreement from the Stockholder in
respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other
amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other
amounts in trust for the benefit of the Stockholder and shall pay to the
Stockholder, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the
amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the aggregate amount
of any payments received from the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
it is the intention of the parties that no insurer or any other third party
shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

7.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) _Survival: Time Limitation_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any writing delivered by the Company to
Parent in connection with this Agreement (including the certificate required
to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3(a)) shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the Escrow Period.

(b) Any claim made by a party hereunder shall be preserved despite
the subsequent expiration of the Escrow Period and any claim set forth in a
Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period shall
survive until final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under this Article VII shall
be brought after the end of the Escrow Period.

(c) _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII unless and
until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable
exceeds $250,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the amount payable
shall include all amounts included in the Deductible and all future amounts
that become payable under Section 7.1 from time to time thereafter.

(d) _Aggregate Amount Limitation_. The aggregate liability for Losses
pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the Escrow Shares and
Parent shall have no claim against the Companys stockholders other than for
the Escrow Shares (and any proceeds of the shares or distributions with
respect to the Escrow Shares).



 

66 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent, on behalf of itself and all other Parent
Indemnitees, hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing,
its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the
requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Article VII
shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Parents or the Companys
right to bring any claim, demand or suit against the other party based upon
such other partys actual fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation or
omission, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation and
warranty, without intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, does
not constitute fraud.

7.6 _Adjustment to Transaction Consideration_. Amounts paid
for indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent as a result of
the Business Combination, except as otherwise required by Law.

7.7 _Stockholder Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_. The parties
acknowledge that the Stockholders obligations under this Article VII are
solely as a representative of the Companys stockholders in the manner set
forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify
Parent under this Article VII and that the Stockholder shall have no
personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by him in such capacity and
that all payments to Parent as a result of such indemnification obligations
shall be made solely from, and to the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-
pocket expenses of the Stockholder for attorneys fees and other costs shall
be borne in the first instance by Parent, which may make a claim for
reimbursement thereof against the Escrow Shares upon the claim with respect to
which such expenses are incurred becoming an Established Claim (as defined in
the Escrow Agreement). The parties further acknowledge that all actions to be
taken by Parent pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on its behalf by
the Appointed Director in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the
Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will hold
the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution of all
claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

ARTICLE VIII

this Agreement;



 

67 (c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Entity shall have issued

action is final and nonappealable;

(d) by the Company, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Article VI would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such breach by Parent
is curable by Parent prior to the Closing Date, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) for thirty (30) days after
delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach,
provided Parent continues to exercise best efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(d) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if
such breach by Parent is cured during such thirty (30)-day period);

(e) by Parent, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement,

satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such breach is curable
by the Company prior to the Closing Date, then Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) for thirty (30) days after delivery
of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach, provided the
Company continues to exercise best efforts to cure such breach (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
breach by the Company is cured during such thirty (30)-day period);

(f) by either Parent or the Company, if, at the Special Meeting (including any
adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby shall fail to be approved and adopted by the affirmative
vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock required under Parents certificate
of incorporation, or the holders of 20% or more of the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in Parents initial public offering and
outstanding as of the date of the record date of the Special Meeting exercise
their rights to convert the shares of Parent Common Stock held by them into
cash in accordance with Parents certificate of incorporation; or

(g) immediately by Parent by written notice to the Company without any cure
period, if (i) the Audited Annual Financials or Affirmed Stub Financials do
not conform with Section 6.3(n) or otherwise do not comply with the conditions
set forth thereunder or are not otherwise produced and delivered in accordance
with Section 5.1, (ii) 2006 Audited Financials are not delivered to Parent on

in the Projections or such Projections are not prepared in strict accordance
with Section 5.22, or (vii) the Fairness Opinion is not received by Parents
board on or prior to January 30, 2007.

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.1 above will be effective immediately upon (or, if
the termination is pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) and the
proviso therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written
notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect and the Business Combination shall be
abandoned, except for and subject to the following: (i) Sections 5.6, 5.13,
8.2 and 8.3 and Article X (General Provisions) shall survive the termination
of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement, including a breach by a party
electing to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if such
partys action or failure to act constituted a principal cause of or resulted
in the failure of the Business Combination to occur on or before the date

this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the words "include," "includes"

include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. For purposes of
this Agreement:

(a) the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " when used in connection with an
entity means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect,
individually or when aggregated with other changes, events, violations,
inaccuracies, circumstances or effects, that is materially adverse to the
business, assets (including intangible assets), revenues, financial condition,
prospects or results of operations of such entity, it being understood that
none of the following alone or in combination shall be deemed, in and of
itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i) changes attributable to
the public announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) changes in general national or regional economic conditions, or
(iii) any SEC rulemaking requiring enhanced disclosure of reverse merger
transactions with a public shell;

(b) the term " _Legal Requirements_ " means any federal, state, local,
municipal, foreign or other law, statute, constitution, principle of common
law, resolution, ordinance, code, edict, decree, rule, regulation, ruling or

(c) the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including
any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any
limited liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise,
association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity;

(d) the term " _knowledge_ " means actual knowledge or awareness, after due
inquiry, as to a specified fact or event of a Person that is an individual or

Person in a similar capacity of an entity other than a corporation; 



 

74 (e) the term " _Lien_ " means any mortgage, pledge, security interest,
encumbrance, lien, restriction or charge of any kind (including, without

in the nature thereof, any sale with recourse against the seller or any
Affiliate of the seller, or any agreement to give any security interest);

(f) the term " _Affiliate_ " means, as applied to any Person, any other Person

means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through
the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and

(g) all monetary amounts set forth herein are referenced in United States
dollars, unless otherwise noted.

10.3 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all
of which shall be considered one and the same document and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile to counsel for the
other party of a counterpart executed by a party shall be deemed to meet
the requirements of the previous sentence.

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in
this Agreement).

10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.



 

75 10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further acknowledge that the Company
and its assets, business and equity securities are unique and therefore, in
the event of the Companys failure to consummate the Business Combination for
any reason other than Parents or Merger Sub breach hereunder, Parent shall
have the right to seek equitable relief hereunder, including specific
performance.

10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

10.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.9 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 10.9, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to any of its affiliates (whether currently existing or
created hereafter), but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder.

10.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

10.11  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.



 

76 10.12 _Arbitration_. Any disputes or claims arising under or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be
resolved by binding arbitration. Notice of a demand to arbitrate a dispute by
either party shall be given in writing to the other at their last known
address. Arbitration shall be commenced by the filing by a party of an
arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") in
its office in New York City. The arbitration and resolution of the dispute
shall be resolved by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA pursuant to AAA
rules. The arbitration shall in all respects be governed and conducted by
applicable AAA rules, and any award and/or decision shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York City.
The arbitrator shall supply a written opinion supporting any award, and
judgment may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Each party shall pay its own fees and expenses for the arbitration, except
that any costs and charges imposed by the AAA and any fees of the arbitrator
for his services shall be assessed against the losing party by the arbitrator.
In the event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary or
desirable in order to prevent a party from acting contrary to this Agreement
or to prevent irreparable harm prior to a confirmation of an arbitration
award, then either party is authorized and entitled to commence a lawsuit
solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending the completion of
the arbitration in a court having jurisdiction over the parties. Each party
hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
located in the State of New York, New York County, for such purpose. All
rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative and in addition to any
other rights and remedies obtainable from arbitration.

10.13 _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.
