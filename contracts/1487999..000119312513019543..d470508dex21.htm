Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE AMALGAMATION_

Section 1.1 _The Amalgamation; Effective Time_ Upon the terms and subject to

Amalgamation to become effective pursuant to the Companies Act. The
Amalgamation shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of
amalgamation (the " _Certificate of Amalgamation_ ") by the Registrar or such
other time as the Certificate of Amalgamation may provide. The parties to
this Agreement agree that they will request the Registrar provide in the
Certificate of Amalgamation that the Effective Time will be the time when the
Amalgamation Application is filed with the Registrar or another time mutually
agreed in writing by the parties to this Agreement (the " _Effective Time_ ").
The name of the Amalgamated Company shall be "SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd."
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Nineteenmoront Corp. shall subscribe
for one Common Share for aggregate consideration of US$0.01 (at least equal to
the par value thereof) (the " _Carry-Forward Share_ ") and the Company shall
issue the Carry-Forward Share to such Person.

which the last of those conditions (other than any conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or (b) at such other place and time or on such other date as Parent
and the Company may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



2 Section 1.3 _Effects of the Amalgamation_ As of the Effective Time, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement,
the Company shall be amalgamated with Acquisition Sub and the amalgamated
company (the " _Amalgamated Company_ ") shall continue after the Amalgamation.
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that (a) the Amalgamation
shall be effected so as to constitute an "amalgamation" and (b) the
Amalgamated Company shall be deemed to be an "amalgamated company" in
accordance with Section 104 of the Companies Act. Under Section 109 of the

become the property of the Amalgamated Company; (iii) the Amalgamated Company
shall continue to be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the
Company and Acquisition Sub; (iv) any existing cause of action, claim or
liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; (v) any civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or
Acquisition Sub may continue to be prosecuted by or against the Amalgamated
Company; (vi) a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of
or against, the Company or Acquisition Sub may be enforced by or against the
Amalgamated Company; and (vii) the Certificate of Amalgamation shall be
deemed to be the certificate of incorporation of the Amalgamated Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the date of incorporation of each of the Company
and Acquisition Sub shall remain its respective original date of
incorporation and the Amalgamation shall not alter its original date of
incorporation.

Section 1.4  _Memorandum of Association_ The memorandum of association of the
Amalgamated Company shall be as set forth in the Amalgamation Agreement.

Section 1.5 _Amalgamated Company Bye-Laws_ The bye-laws of the Amalgamated
Company shall be the bye-laws of Acquisition Sub, which are attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (as they may be amended or modified from time to time after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of
the parties) (the " _Amalgamated Company Bye-Laws_ ").

 

Section 1.6 _Directors_ The parties to this Agreement shall take all requisite

4 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Transaction Consideration_
 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a
bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable
discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Amalgamation (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent,
the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion.

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
funds to the Paying Agent in amounts sufficient for the payment of the
aggregate Transaction Consideration payable under _Section 2.1(c)_. Such
funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Shares
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ the following: (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holders
converted shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates, or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and a Letter of Transmittal to the Paying
Agent and (B) instructions for surrendering such Certificates, if any.

 

(ii) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of that Certificate shall be entitled to receive, and the Paying
Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, the Transaction Consideration payable
in respect of the number of Common Shares evidenced by that Certificate less
any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates so surrendered shall be
canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any
amount payable upon surrender of Certificates.

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate but may, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to
deliver an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the
Transaction Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this _Article II_. Each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares
whose Common Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time or
following the Paying Agents receipt of an "agents message" and the
applicable Letter of Transmittal (or, at any later time at which such Book-
Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after
such time, the Transaction Consideration to which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_. 

 



5 (iv) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Transaction Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, then the Transaction Consideration may be paid to
such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the
Person requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2)
establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that any such
Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

(v) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this  _Section
2.2(c)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Transaction Consideration. Any Transaction Consideration paid upon
the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and the Common Shares formerly represented by it.

 

(d) _No Further Transfers_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
register of members of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Common Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Transaction
Consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under (i) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the " _Code_ "), (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or
(iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted and withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to
the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all
purposes under this Agreement.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Amalgamated Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the laws of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding US$3 billion. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Payment Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be
paid promptly to Parent.

 



6 (h) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to Parent for payment
of the applicable Transaction Consideration.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such Person of a bond in the form reasonably required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay the Transaction Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

Section 2.3 _Company Restricted Shares_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, any vesting conditions or restrictions
applicable to each restricted share (" _Company Restricted Share_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall lapse and each such
Company Restricted Share shall be treated in accordance with _Section
2.1(c)_.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Company Restricted Shares a letter
describing the treatment of such Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_.

Section 2.4 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_ All Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(c)_, as though such
Dissenting Shares were Common Shares for the purposes thereof, and any
Dissenting Holder shall, in the event that the fair value of a Dissenting
Share as determined by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106 of the
Companies Act is greater than the Transaction Consideration, be paid such
difference by the Amalgamated Company within thirty (30) days of the final
Court appraisal of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares. Additionally, in
the event that a Dissenting Holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal, its Common Shares shall be cancelled
and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration for each such Dissenting Share held by such
Dissenting Holder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any
demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands
received by the Company and (B) to the extent that the Company has
Knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with the Company in settlement
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any written demands for
appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or
applications without the prior written consent of Parent.

Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such action has been
threatened in a manner inconsistent with the historical experience of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which, in either case, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

of such conditions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ and the performance by the Company of its obligations
thereunder, the Amalgamated Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, will not: (a) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is
such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair market value of its
assets or because the fair saleable value (determined on a going

probable liability on its existing debts as they mature); (b) have incurred

contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.10 _Brokers_ The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,

banker in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub.

 



28 Section 4.11 _Limited Guaranty_ Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has caused the Guarantor to deliver to the Company the duly
executed Limited Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, and no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Limited
Guaranty.

Section 4.12 _Financing_ Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of (i) the Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, OTPP has committed to
provide the financing in the amount set forth therein (the " _Equity_
_Financing_ ") and (ii) the Debt Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association has committed to provide financing up to the aggregate
amount set forth therein for the purposes set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and the performance
by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds
to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by Equity Commitment
Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter and together with available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of the Company, in the aggregate, will
be sufficient to (i) fund the payment of the aggregate
Transaction Consideration in respect of the Common Shares, (ii) pay any and
all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Acquisition Sub in
connection with the Amalgamation and the Equity Financing and (iii) satisfy
all of the other payment obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub
contemplated hereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, each of the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect
and, to the knowledge of Parent and Acquisition Sub, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of the parties thereto, in each case, except as
enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or remedies in general, as from time
to time in effect, or (B) the exercise by courts of equity powers. Neither
the Equity Commitment Letter nor the Debt Commitment Letter has been amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and
the commitment contained in the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable, has not, prior to the date of this
Agreement, been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. There are
no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the
availability or aggregate amount of the Equity Financing or the Debt
Financing, as applicable. The Equity Commitment Letter does not violate the
fund documents of OTPP and OTPP has the ability to make capital calls
sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount under the Equity
Financing or the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would

 



29  reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Acquisition Sub under the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Acquisition
Subs obligation to consummate the Amalgamation and performance by the Company
of its obligations under this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will
not be satisfied or that the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing will
not otherwise be made available to Parent or Acquisition Sub on the Closing
Date to the extent necessary.

constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (y)
after consultation with its outside counsel, that engaging in such discussions
or negotiations is necessary in order for the Company Board to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives), if the Company Board determines (x) in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with its outside counsel, that
such action is necessary in order for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, but only so long as the Company has
caused such Person to enter into a confidentiality agreement (negotiations and
discussions with respect to which are expressly permitted following the
requisite Company Board determination) with the Company on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information has previously
been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; or

(iii) (1) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (2)
approve, endorse or recommend such Takeover Proposal, or (3) cause or permit
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ solely
in order to concurrently enter into an agreement regarding a Superior

 



35  Proposal, if (A) the Company receives from the Person submitting such
Takeover Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement (which the Company may
negotiate with the Person during the four (4) Business Day notice period) in
a customary form that is no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the Company Board determines (x) in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall
not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or approve, endorse or recommend
such Takeover Proposal, and the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to clause (3) above, until (I) after the fourth (4th) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Company Board and, if applicable, a statement that
the Company Board intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.4(a)_ (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new four (4) Business Day period), (II) during such four (4)
Business Day period following Parents receipt of a Notice of Superior
Proposal, in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, to
endorse or recommend such Takeover Proposal or to cause or permit the Company
to so terminate this Agreement, (A) the Company shall have offered
to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated with) Parent in making such
commercially reasonable adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) the Company Board
shall have determined, after considering the results of such negotiations and
the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Notice of Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal, and (III) payment of the Company Termination Fee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board shall be permitted to (i)
disclose to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
and (ii) make such other public disclosure if it determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, it being understood, however, that this clause (ii) shall
not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or take any of the actions referred to in clause (iii) of _Section
5.4(d)_, except to the extent permitted by this  _Section 5.4(d)_.

Section 5.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ ") Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to provide employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Employees_ ")
with compensation and benefits (other than equity compensation) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than 

 



38  those provided under the Companys compensation and benefit plans, programs,
policies, practices and arrangements in effect at the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that during such one-year period, nothing herein
shall prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or
arrangement, require that the Amalgamated Company provide or permit investment
in the securities of Parent or the Amalgamated Company or interfere with the
Amalgamated Companys right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Amalgamated
Company from terminating the employment of any Employee.

(b) Parent shall and shall cause the Amalgamated Company to honor the
individual agreements and Company Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.8(b)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter in effect as of the date hereof in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such
agreements and Company Benefit Plans and except as provided herein. During the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide all Employees who suffer an
involuntary termination of employment without cause with severance benefits
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Employees
under the Companys severance policy as in effect immediately prior to the
date hereof and as set forth in Section 5.8(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(c) For the purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates in which any Employees may
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "),
each Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or
acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of vesting or eligibility
for any plans which are frozen to new participants, benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plans or to the extent it would result in duplication
of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket requirements applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



39 (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment to
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or
terminating any of its benefit plans in accordance with their terms or (iii)
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit plan
which Parent or the Company may maintain.

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Amalgamated Company
shall cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents, or in agreements, copies of
which have been provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise in effect on the date of this Agreement to survive the Amalgamation
and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Effective Time, or, if longer, for such period as is set forth
in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date
of this Agreement, copies of which have been provided to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement. Parent shall guarantee such performance by the
Amalgamated Company.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to indemnify all Indemnified
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with respect to
all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as
directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to or
at the Effective Time. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any
Legal Action in connection with any matter occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to pay as incurred
such Indemnified Partys legal fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such Legal Action, subject to the Amalgamated Companys receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if and only to the
extent required by applicable Law, to repay such legal fees, costs and
expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, as of the Effective
Time, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time which obligation may be
satisfied by extending the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company or by providing for policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred before or at the Effective Time so long as the
Amalgamated Company is not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to
the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ ").
If the

 



40  Amalgamated Company is unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior
sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, the
Amalgamated Company shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) The covenants contained in this  _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with, amalgamates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of the Amalgamated Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts_ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Laws,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ are satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.

accordance with applicable Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain from any Governmental Entities any

orders required to be obtained by the parties to this Agreement in connection
with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) make all
necessary registrations and filings, and thereafter make any other submissions
required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or the Company, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under (A) the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) Foreign Competition Laws, (C) the
Companies Act, (D) the NYSE rules and regulations and (E) any other
applicable Laws or from CFIUS. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings and
notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the
non-filing party or its advisors prior to filing. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall file any such document if the other party has reasonably
objected to the filing of such document. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



41 The parties to this Agreement will cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing parties, and
make reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties informed in all material respects of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) consult with the other parties prior to
taking a position, and permit the other parties to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any investigations or proceedings related solely to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party and (iv) consult with the other parties in
advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to

opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (unless
prohibited by such Governmental Entity). The parties contemplate that as a
general matter the Company shall be represented at in-person meetings with any
Governmental Entity (unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this  _Section 5.11(a)_ as "Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the
recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent as the case
may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause
their respective outside counsels to comply with this _Section 5.11_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.11_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and, privileged
communications and competitively sensitive information.

Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department
of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall contact CFIUS as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days of the date hereof and request an informal consultation,
following which they will jointly prepare and submit a draft joint voluntary
notice in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Section 800.401(g), and after resolution
of all questions and comments received from CFIUS on such draft, shall prepare
and submit the CFIUS Notice, and the parties shall respond to any inquiries
from CFIUS in respect of the CFIUS filing, and the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to respond within the time frame set forth in 31
C.F.R. Section 800.403(a)(3), or otherwise provided by CFIUS, without the need
to request an extension of time, and shall make any other submissions under
Exon-Florio that are required to be made or

 



42  that the parties agree should be made. If Parent or the Company (or any of
their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information
from any Governmental Entity that is related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, an appropriate response to such request. Parent shall
advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulatory Laws, (ii) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) execute
and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company be
obligated to agree, as a condition for resolving any such objections, to
dispose of, divest of or hold separate any of its properties or other assets,
or the properties or other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries after
the consummation of the Amalgamation or to subject itself to any restriction
on the operation of its business or the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the consummation of the Amalgamation that would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
properties, assets, financial condition or Liabilities of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of
the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of
the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_, _Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section
7.2(d)_ so long as such party has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.11_.

Recommendation Change has occurred or in connection with _Section 5.4(d)_,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement

reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such
release or making any such public statement.

Expenses, except that Parent and the Company shall share equally each of the
filing fees with respect to the filings contemplated by _Section 5.11(a)_.

 

Section 5.15 _Takeover Statutes_ If any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Amalgamation or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall (a) take all necessary action to ensure
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b)
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute.

 

Section 5.16 _Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements_ Subject to
_Section 5.4_, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the Company will not terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality agreement not entered into in the ordinary
course of business or any agreement by a third party not to acquire assets or
securities of the Company to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to its terms or by written
agreement of the parties thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Company shall not be obligated to
comply with this _Section 5.16_ if the Company Board determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such compliance is
necessary in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not take
any action that would otherwise fail to comply with this _Section 5.16_ in
reliance on the foregoing exception until after the third (3rd) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Company intends to take such action and specifying the nature of the
action to be taken, it being understood and agreed that in determining whether
to authorize the Company to take such action the Company Board shall take into
account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent to the Company in response to such written notice.

Section 5.17  _Related Party Transactions_ Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take such
action as is required to cause any Related Party Transaction (other than those
agreements set forth in  _Section 5.17_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) to
be terminated without the creation of any Liability with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon such termination.

 

Section 5.18 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of
the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, as
applicable (as each may be amended in accordance with the terms 

 



44  below), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein
and (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected
timing of the Closing) all conditions, and otherwise comply with all terms,
applicable to Parent and Acquisition Sub in such definitive agreements within
their control. Parent and Acquisition Sub may not agree to or permit any
amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter without
the consent of the Company. Parent and Acquisition Sub may not agree to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing without the
consent of the Company if such amendments, supplement, other modification or
waivers would or could reasonably be expected to (w) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to repay or refinance
the debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, (x)
impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or
amend or otherwise modify the existing conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing so as to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
(provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Acquisition Sub may
replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities).

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient

financing efforts that Parent may undertake in connection with any Debt
Financing, in connection with obtaining consents from the Companys lenders or
note holders under the Companys existing financing arrangements or with

financing arrangements to occur at or following the Closing, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including, but not limited to, participation

accordance with the terms thereof.

provision to any lender, manager, administrative agent, collateral agent,

subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, warranty, inducement,
promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Agreement.

Section 8.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_ Except for (a) the Persons
intended to benefit from the provisions of _Section 5.9_, each of whom shall
have the right to enforce such provisions directly and (b) the right of
holders of Common Shares and Company Restricted Shares to receive Transaction
Consideration pursuant to _Article II_ (a claim with respect to which shall be
enforceable only by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, on
behalf of the shareholders of the Company or the holders of
Company Restricted Shares), this Agreement is not intended to confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources are hereby third-party
beneficiaries of  _Section 7.5_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 7.7_
(Amendment), _Section 8.4_ (Governing Law), _Section 8.5_ (Submission to
Jurisdiction), _Section 8.6_ (Waiver of Jury Trial), this  _Section 8.9_
(No Third-Party Beneficiaries), _Section 8.13_ (Remedies), and _Section
8.14_ (Specific Performance).

Section 8.10 _Severability_ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in
order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons
or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction. 

Section 8.11 _Rules of Construction_ The parties to this Agreement have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in any agreement or other document shall be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or other document. 

 



60 Section 8.12 _Assignment_ This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise, except that Parent may designate, by written notice to
the Company, a Subsidiary that is wholly-owned by Parent to be amalgamated
with the Company in lieu of Acquisition Sub, in which event all references in
this Agreement to Acquisition Sub shall be deemed references to such
Subsidiary, and in that case, all representations and warranties made in this
Agreement with respect to Acquisition Sub as of the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation, mutatis mutandis.

Section 8.13 _Remedies_ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.
Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that regardless of any
termination of this Agreement, the Company may recover, solely through an
action brought by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, damages
from Parent and Acquisition Sub if Parent or Acquisition Sub intentionally and
in bad faith breaches this Agreement and the remedy of specific performance
set forth in  _Section 8.14_ is not available to the Company, in which event
the damages recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of holders of
Common Shares and Company Restricted Shares (without duplication) shall not be
limited to expenses or out-of-pocket costs, but may include the benefit of
the bargain lost by the Company and the holders of Common Shares and Company
Restricted Shares taking into consideration all relevant matters. Any damages
recovered in any such action brought by the Company may be retained by the
Company for any corporate purpose or distributed to the holders of Common
Shares and Company Restricted Shares as the Company Board determines in its
sole and absolute discretion.

 

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to  _Section 7.6_
hereof and the discretion of the courts described in _Section 8.5_, the
parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or violations of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the courts
described in _Section 8.5_, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Moreover, and in recognition of
the foregoing, but subject to _Section 7.6_ of this Agreement in all
respects, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby waives (a) any defense
in any action for specific performance of this Agreement that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law for any party to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 8.15 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, all of which shall be one and the same agreement.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party to this Agreement shall
have received (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission)
counterparts signed by all of the other parties.
