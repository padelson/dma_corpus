estimate of the Net Working Capital of the Companies as of the Closing (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), together with a reasonably detailed

Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or negative, shall mean (i) the
Estimated Net Working Capital, minus (ii) $15,130,089 (the " _Base
Working Capital_ "), with Base Working Capital equal to the Net Working
Capital of the Companies as of June 30, 2007 (the " _Reference Statement Date_
"), and Net Working Capital having been derived from the combined balance
sheet of the Companies as of the Reference Statement Date (the " _Reference
Balance Sheet_ "). The calculation of the Base Working Capital is set forth in
Exhibit 2.06(a). The effective time of the Closing for purposes of calculating
the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital shall
be 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date. The calculation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital shall use the same
methodology as the calculation of the Base Working Capital, except that
Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital shall not
reflect the conduct of business or any action that takes place on the Closing
Date after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that is
outside of the ordinary course of business of the Companies.

(b) _Estimated Capital Expenditure Adjustment_. Not later than three (3) days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser its good faith
estimate of the cumulative capital expenditures made by the Companies for the
period from November 1, 2007 through the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Capex
Amount_ "), together with a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation
thereof. The " _Estimated Capex Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or
negative, shall mean the remainder of (i) the Estimated Capex Amount minus
(ii) the Budgeted Capex Amount. The effective time of the Closing for purposes
of calculating the Estimated Capex Amount shall be 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date. The calculation of the Estimated Capex Amount shall not reflect the
conduct of business or any action that takes place on the Closing Date after

the ordinary course of business of the Companies.

(c) _Closing Balance Sheet_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days thereafter,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller (i) a combined balance sheet of the
Companies as of the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Companies as of the Closing, as
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet and otherwise in accordance herewith
(the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), and (iii) a calculation of the
cumulative capital expenditures made by the Companies from October 1,
2007 through the Closing Date (the " _Closing Capex Amount_ "). The  



 

12  Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet; provided
that the methods described in Section 3.07 of the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the Reference Balance Sheet shall be applied to the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet.

(d) _Disputes_. Upon delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, Purchaser will
provide to Seller and its accountants reasonable access to the books
and records of the Companies, to the extent reasonably related to its
evaluation of the Closing Balance Sheet, the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital and the calculation of the Closing Capex Amount. If Seller
shall disagree with the calculation of (a) the Closing Net Working Capital or
any element of the Closing Balance Sheet relevant thereto or (b) the Closing
Capex Amount, it shall notify Purchaser of such disagreement in writing within
sixty (60) days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Capex Amount which notice shall set forth in detail the particulars of
such disagreement. In the event that Seller does not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such sixty (60) day period, Seller shall be deemed to
have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet, the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital and the calculation of the Closing Capex Amount delivered by
Purchaser, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided by
Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital or the calculation of the Closing Capex Amount.
If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by
Purchaser and Seller) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which such dispute is
referred to the Auditor, based solely on written submissions forwarded by
Purchaser and Seller to the Auditor within ten (10) Business Days following
the Auditors selection, (a) whether the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in
accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.06(c) and (only with
respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) whether and
to what extent (if any) the Closing Net Working Capital determination requires
adjustment or (b) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Capex Amount
determination requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall
be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. The determination of the
Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on
which the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Capex Amount is finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.06(d) is referred as to the "
_Determination Date_."

(e)  _Payment_. The " _Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be
positive or negative, shall mean (i) the Closing Net Working Capital minus
(ii) the Base Working Capital. If the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (such
difference, the " _Net Working Capital Increase Amount_ "), then within five
(5) days after the Determination Date, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Net
Working Capital Increase Amount. If the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is greater than the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(such difference, the " _Net Working Capital Deficit Amount_ "), then within
five (5) days after the Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the
Net Working Capital Deficit Amount. If the Closing Capex Amount is greater
than the Estimated Capex Amount (such difference, the " _Capex Increase
Amount_ "), then  



 

13  within five (5) days after the Determination Date, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the Capex Increase Amount. If the Estimated Capex Amount is
greater than the Closing Capex Amount (such difference, the " _Capex Deficit
Amount_ "), then within five (5) days after the Determination Date, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the Capex Deficit Amount.

(f) _Interest on Payments_. Any payments required to be made by Seller or
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.06(e) shall bear interest from the date of
the Closing through the date of payment at the rate identified by The Wall
Street Journal on the date of payment as the United States prime rate.

DMA after written notice from any Company that carriage of such Station is

agreement or disputed the Stations right to carriage pursuant to any must-
carry election.

(d) All material reports and filings required to be filed with the FCC by each
of the Companies with respect to the Stations have been timely filed.
All such reports and filings are accurate and complete in all material

thereunder and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated

notify the other party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the

party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless, to the extent permitted by Law, it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
in seeking the Government Consents. Except as prohibited by Law, the parties

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01. _Employment_. During the one (1) year period following
the Closing, to the extent Purchaser or any of the Companies retains
employees employed by any of the Companies immediately prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall, or Purchaser shall cause each of the Companies to, continue
such employment at a level of salary, wages, bonus opportunities,
commissions, if applicable, and benefits which in the aggregate are at least
substantially equivalent to the salary, wages, bonus opportunities,
commissions, if applicable, and benefits provided to Purchasers similarly
situated employees, or, in the absence of such employees, to such employees
prior to the Closing by Seller or the Companies. No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed (a) as a guarantee of continued employment of
any employee of any of the Companies and this Agreement shall not be construed
so as to prohibit Purchaser or any of the Companies from having the right to
terminate the employment of any employee, or (b) to prevent the
amendment, modification or termination of any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement maintained or established by Purchaser, any of the Companies or
their Affiliates on or after the Closing (the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") as long
as Purchaser complies with its obligations hereunder. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all severance obligations with respect to any termination of
employment of any Company employee following the Closing. Any obligations
resulting from deferred compensation, long term incentive, equity-based
award, change of control, or transaction agreements, plans, programs, or
policies in effect with Seller on or before the Closing will reside and remain
with Seller regardless of whether payments due thereunder are made (or to be
made) before, on or after Closing, and effective upon the Closing, any of the
Companies participation in the Lincoln Financial Media Company Annual
Incentive Plan and all other non-commission type bonus incentive plans
shall cease, and any obligations applicable to such plans shall reside and
remain with Seller except to the extent such obligations are reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet.

SECTION 6.02. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) As of the Closing, the Companies shall cease to be participating
employers in all Seller Plans. Each employee of the Companies shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Companies (and any
predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing under any Purchaser Plan
providing benefits similar to those provided under such Seller Plan, except
to the extent that such crediting would result in duplication of benefits and
provided that no prior service credit shall be recognized for purposes of
benefit accrual. Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall pay the value of
any accrued paid time off to all employees of the Companies in accordance with
the terms of the Seller Plans pursuant to which such paid time off benefits
are provided.

(b) For a period of no less than one (1) year following the Closing, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Companies to, maintain a severance plan for the
benefit of employees of the Companies that is substantially comparable to, and
provides no less benefits than, the severance plan maintained by Purchaser or
its Affiliates for the benefit of employees of the Companies immediately prior
to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any employee
receive, or be eligible to receive, severance for a period of less than two
(2) weeks.

  

 

32 (c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall cause the portion of its
flexible spending account reimbursement plan (the " _Seller FSA Plan_ ")
applicable to employees of the Companies to be segregated into a separate
component and the account balances in such Seller FSA Plan shall be
transferred by Seller to a replacement flexible spending account plan
established or maintained by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries (the "
_Purchaser FSA Plan_ ") as of the Closing for the benefit of such employees.
The Purchaser FSA Plan shall reimburse Seller or the Seller FSA Plan at the
end of the calendar year containing the Closing Date to the extent amounts
were paid to a participant by the Seller FSA Plan and not collected from the
participant by the Seller or Seller FSA Plan and such amounts are
subsequently collected by the Purchaser FSA Plan with respect to such
participant.

(d) Each employee of the Companies shall be given credit under the Purchaser
Plans providing welfare benefits for amounts paid under any Plan providing
welfare benefits for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the parallel Purchaser Plan. Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and any Purchaser Plans to, waive all limitations
as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to participation and coverage of
employees of the Companies and their eligible dependents in any Purchaser Plan
that is a welfare plan except to the extent any such limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and evidence of insurability
are effective under any Seller Plans at the time of Closing.

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall take all action necessary or
appropriate to cause a defined contribution plan adopted or maintained by
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") to
recognize prior service with Seller and the Companies for purposes of vesting
and participation. Seller shall permit, and Purchaser shall cause the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept, a "rollover" of any account balances of
employees of the Companies and Seller under the defined
contribution retirement plan of Seller and its Affiliates, as amended from
time to time (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. In
connection with any such rollover elected by any employee of the Companies,
Purchaser shall allow any such employees outstanding loan and related
promissory note under the Seller 401(k) Plan to be rolled over into the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan. The Purchasers 401(k) Plan shall be governed by its
currently existing plan provisions and requirements (including those
governing the amount of employer contributions), and not those plan provisions
and requirements of Sellers 401(k) Plan or any other defined contribution
plan previously or currently maintained by Seller. 

(f) Any past, present or future obligations resulting from defined benefit,
pension, profit sharing, or post-retirement health and welfare plans,
policies, or agreements of Seller in effect on or before the Closing will
reside and remain with Seller.

(g) Seller will be responsible for any obligations under its plans, policies
or programs related to current or former Company employees currently eligible
to receive benefits under COBRA or long term disability policies, plans or
programs as of the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , any current Company
employees covered under any such long term disability policies, plans or
programs as of the Closing shall become employees of Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates effective as of the date they are ready to return to active
employment. By way of clarification  



 

33  and not in limitation of the immediately preceding sentence, Seller shall be
responsible for providing COBRA coverage with respect to any Company
employee terminated prior to the Closing.

(a) Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser that, except as set
forth in Section 7.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) all material Tax
Returns required to have been filed by or with respect to any of the Companies
have been timely filed (taking into account any extension of time to file
granted or obtained); (ii) all Taxes shown to be payable on such Tax Returns
have been paid or will be timely paid; (iii) no deficiency for any material

Parties from and against any and all Losses due to any Excluded Taxes.

Parties from and against any and all Losses due to the breach of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Article VII by Purchaser and its Affiliates.

(e) This Section 7.01 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and
Purchaser with respect to the breach of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Article VII.

SECTION 7.02. _Straddle Periods_.

(a) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date:

(i) in the case of Taxes other than those Taxes described in Section
7.02(a)(ii) hereof, shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset
against such Taxes) if the taxable period ended on the date of the Closing;
and

(ii) in the case of property or ad valorem Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the assets of the Companies shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes  



 

34  for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be
deducted from or offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(b) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this Section 7.02
taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund relates. In the case
of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term
debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this
Section 7.02 shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the
date of the Closing. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Companies.

SECTION 7.03. _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refund, credit or
similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portions of taxable periods) ending
on or before the date of the Closing shall be the property of Seller, and if
received by Purchaser or the Companies, shall be paid over promptly to
Seller. Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at Sellers reasonable
expense, cause the Companies or other relevant entity to file for and use its
best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which Seller
is entitled under this Section 7.03. Purchaser shall permit Seller to
participate in (at Sellers expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim.

SECTION 7.04. _Contests_.

(a) Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to any consolidated federal
income Tax Return (or similar combined, consolidated or unitary state income
Tax Return) that includes Seller or the Companies with respect to a taxable
period of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing
Consolidated Audit_ ").

(b) With respect to any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding with
respect to Taxes of the Companies (other than a Pre-Closing Consolidated
Audit), Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by any
of the Companies of a written notice of any audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the Companies which Seller
may have liability (a " _Tax Contest Claim_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , no
failure or delay by Purchaser to provide notice of a Tax Contest Claim shall
reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of Seller hereunder except to the
extent Seller is actually prejudiced thereby. Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim.
Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim
for a period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Claim_ ") if Seller provides Purchaser with notice of its election to control
such claim within thirty (30) days of Purchaser notifying Seller of such Tax
Contest Claim, provided if the resolution of such Pre-Closing Tax Claim could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of the
Companies for a period that ends after the Closing Date then: (i) Seller shall
keep Purchaser informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such
Pre-Closing Tax Claim, (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any
Pre-Closing Tax Claim and (iii) Seller shall not compromise or  



 

35  settle any Pre-Closing Tax Claim without obtaining Purchasers consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
If Seller does not elect to control a Pre-Closing Tax Claim within the time
period set forth above, then Purchaser shall be entitled to control all
aspects of such claim.

(c) With respect to any Tax Contest Claim for a period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Tax Claim_ "), Purchaser shall
control such claim, provided that (A) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Straddle Tax Claim, (B)
Seller shall be entitled to participate in any Straddle Tax Claim and (C)
Purchaser shall not compromise or settle a Straddle Tax Claim without
obtaining Sellers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

SECTION 7.05.  _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to
be filed by, with respect to or that include the Companies with respect to
taxable periods of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date, and
such Tax Returns, to the extent they relate to the Companies, shall be
prepared consistent with past practices, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Companies shall be included in the federal consolidated
income Tax Return of which Sellers Parent is the common parent for the tax
year of the Companies that ends on the Closing Date (and any
similar combined, consolidated or unitary state income Tax Return) (the "
_Consolidated Tax Returns_ "), Seller shall cause such Consolidated Tax
Returns to be filed on a timely basis and Seller shall pay, or cause to be
paid, all such Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Seller shall provide a
copy of each separate Company income and franchise Tax Return to Purchaser for
Purchasers review and consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking into
account any applicable extensions) for such Tax Return. Seller shall consider
in good faith any reasonable comments received from Purchaser in writing no
later than ten (10) Business Days before the due date of such Tax Return.
Seller shall provide a copy of each other separate Company Tax Return within a
reasonable period of time prior to the due date of such Tax Return (taking
into account any applicable extensions) to enable the Company to timely file
such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, separate Company Tax Returns
shall not include any portion of a Consolidated Tax Return.

(b) Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the
Companies, other than the Consolidated Tax Returns, that are prepared by
Seller pursuant to Section 7.05(a) (" _Stand-Alone Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
") and subject to the other provisions in this Agreement, shall pay or cause
to be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall cause
to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Companies for taxable periods starting
on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (each, a "
_Straddle Period_ "), and shall cause such Tax Returns to be prepared
consistent with past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable
law. Purchaser shall provide a copy of any Straddle Period Tax Return to

date for such Tax Return. Purchaser shall incorporate any reasonable comments
received from Seller in writing no later than five (5) Business Days before

Seller shall cooperate fully, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Companies. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall (i) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods and (ii) give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the requesting party
to take possession of such books and records. 

SECTION 7.07. _Tax Covenants_.

(a) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall take, or cause or
permit the Companies to take, any action or omit to take any action which
could increase Sellers or any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes except
as may be required by Law.

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall amend, refile or
otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Companies to amend, refile or
otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return or grant an extension of any
applicable statute of limitations, in each case with respect to any taxable
period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of Seller.

(c) The parties hereto agree that none of Seller, Purchaser, or any of their
respective Affiliates will make a ratable allocation election under Treas.
Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other similar Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In accordance with Treas.
Reg. §1.1502-76 and any analogous Law, any Tax related to any extraordinary
transaction that occurs on the Closing Date after the Closing shall be
allocated to the taxable period beginning after the Closing Date.

(d) Purchaser shall elect, and shall cause its Affiliates to elect, to waive
any right to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit of any of
the Companies which arises in a taxable year or portion thereof beginning
after the Closing Date to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code.



 

37 SECTION 7.08. _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing for a period of five
(5) years.

SECTION 7.09. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly make and file elections under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and any comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law
(together, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the deemed
sale of the assets of the Companies and, at the Closing, the parties shall
execute IRS Forms 8023 (or successor form and any similar state or local
forms), with all attachments. The parties shall cooperate with each other to
take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional
forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required)
to effect and preserve timely elections in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state or
local Tax Law) or any successor provisions.

(b) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, Seller shall allocate
the Purchase Price among the Companies pursuant to an allocation schedule (the
" _Allocation Schedule_ ") to be prepared by Seller and delivered to
Purchaser within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date. For each of the
Companies, Seller shall allocate the Purchase Price as set forth in the
Allocation Schedule and the liabilities of each Company to the assets deemed
sold by any "old T" under applicable Treasury Regulations and the value of
the assets deemed purchased by any "new T" under applicable Treasury
Regulations, and Seller shall prepare draft IRS Forms 8883 (or successor forms
and any similar state or local forms) with respect to the Companies based on
such allocations. Seller shall provide such draft IRS Forms 8883 to Purchaser
no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. The Parties agree that
the IRS Forms 8883 prepared in connection with the Section 338(h)(10)
Election shall be based on the Allocation Schedule, and Seller shall allocate
the aggregate deemed sales price (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338-4) of the assets of the Companies deemed sold, and the adjusted
grossed-up basis (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-5)
of the assets of the Companies deemed purchased, in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-6 and the other requirements of the Code, including
any adjustments thereto required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-7,
based in each case upon the Allocation Schedule.

(c) If, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Allocation Schedule
and draft IRS Forms 8883, Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser
disagrees with such Allocation Schedule or one or more draft IRS Forms
8883, then the Purchaser shall specify in writing to the Seller in reasonable
detail the basis for its disagreement with respect to the items on which it
disagrees and the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve their
disagreement with respect to such items within the twenty (20) days following
notification by Purchaser to Seller of such disagreement. If Purchaser does
not so notify Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Allocation
Schedule and draft IRS Forms 8883, or upon resolution of the disputed items
by the parties, the Allocation Schedule shall become the " _Final Allocation
Schedule_ " and the draft IRS Forms 8883 shall become the " _Final IRS Forms
8883_." If the parties are unable to resolve their disagreement within the
thirty (30) days following any such notification by Purchaser, then the
parties shall submit all such disputed items for resolution to the Auditor,  



 

38  following the procedures and consistent with the provisions set forth in
Section 2.06(d) hereof. The Allocation Schedule and any IRS Forms 8883,
as determined by the Auditor, shall be the Final Allocation Schedule and
Final IRS Form 8883, respectively. The parties shall (i) be bound by the Final
Allocation Schedule and all Final IRS Forms 8883 for purposes of determining
any Taxes and (ii) prepare and file their Tax Returns on a basis consistent
with the Final Allocation Schedule and Final IRS Forms 8883; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Seller and Purchaser
from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority
based upon or arising out of the allocation in the Final IRS Forms 8883, and
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to litigate before any court,
any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority challenging such
allocation. No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Final IRS
Forms 8883 and any related documentation are required to be filed under the
applicable Laws, Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser a Final Form
8883 with respect to each of the Companies.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.01. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. (a) The
representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement, and (b) any certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to Section
2.04(d) or by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.05(d), shall survive the Closing
for a period of twelve (12) months; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim
made with reasonable specificity by the party seeking to be indemnified
within the time periods set forth in this Section 9.01 shall survive until
such claim is finally and fully resolved.

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by Seller_. Following the Closing, Purchaser
and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ")
shall be indemnified and held harmless by Seller for and against all losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
(including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses) actually
suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter, a " _Loss_ "), arising out of or
resulting from: (a) any (i) representation or warranty made by Seller
contained in this Agreement, or (ii) certificate delivered by Seller pursuant
to Section 2.04(d), being untrue or incorrect; or (b) the breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by
Seller after the Closing.

SECTION 9.03. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Following the Closing, Seller
and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and  



 

40  assigns (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Purchaser for and against any and all Losses, arising out of
or resulting from: (a) any (i) representation or warranty made by Purchaser
contained in this Agreement, or (ii) certificate delivered by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.05(d), being untrue or incorrect; (b) the breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by
Purchaser after the Closing; or (c) any claim or cause of action by any Person
arising before or after the Closing against any Seller Indemnified Party with
respect to the operations of the Companies, except for claims or causes of
action with respect to which Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.02.

SECTION 9.04. _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) unless and until the aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying
Party exceeds an amount equal to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000), after
which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for those Losses in excess
of such amount; (ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the
causes set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) shall be an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the limitations set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.04(a)
shall not apply to claims arising out of breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.01, 3.03 or 4.01; (iii) neither party
hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any
punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including
loss of future revenue or income, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

(b) For all purposes of Article VII and this Article IX, "Losses" shall be
net of (i) any insurance or other recoveries payable to the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification and (ii) any Tax benefit available to the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or
payment of any such Losses (including the net present value of any Tax benefit
arising in subsequent taxable years, calculated using a discount rate equal
to the rate identified by The Wall Street Journal on the date of
indemnification payment as the United States prime rate). The Indemnifying
Party may require an Indemnified Party to assign its rights to seek recovery
from any third party.

SECTION 9.05. _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_. An Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of any matter which an Indemnified
Party has determined has given or could give rise to a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement describing in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances with respect to such claim, stating the amount of the Loss,
if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. With respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty, such notice must be received on or prior to the date on which the
representation or warranty on which such claim is based ceases to survive as
set forth in Section 9.01, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such
claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date. If the matter
is a claim brought by  



 

41  a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
such notice from the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects
to undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third
Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment
or unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third
Party Claim liability or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be
taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense of any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.05 and
proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final
judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the
settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding.

SECTION 9.06. _Remedies_. Following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
Purchaser and Seller with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that this provision shall not
limit any remedies available to Seller in respect of a breach of Section 5.04
or to either party in respect of Article VII (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall be governed by Section 7.01). Each party hereto shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

SECTION 9.07. _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payments made
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX or Article VII shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state and local
income Tax purposes.

SECTION 9.08. _Tax Matters_. Anything in this Article IX to the contrary
notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect
to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by Article
VII and shall not be subject to this Article IX, except for Sections 9.04(b),
9.06 and 9.07.

prior to the Closing:

(a) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred by
the Termination Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.01(a) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been
the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or prior to such date;

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall have become final and nonappealable;

give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the
giving of written notice by Seller to Purchaser specifying such breach,
_provided_ , _however_ , that a failure by Purchaser to pay the Purchase Price
at Closing shall be a material breach not subject to cure;

(d) by Purchaser if Seller shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after the giving of written notice by Purchaser to Seller specifying
such breach; or

(e) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser.

SECTION 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto except

shall relieve either party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination.

SECTION 11.03. _Public Announcements_. Neither party to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent
of the other party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock
exchange regulation, and the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to
the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication.

SECTION 11.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is deemed by any court to be violative of Law or public policy
and therefore invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

SECTION 11.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller and Purchaser with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party
hereto without the express written consent of the other parties
(which consent may be granted or withheld in such parties sole discretion);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to Lincoln National Corporation, an Indiana corporation.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each party
hereto, or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. _Waiver_. Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the  



 

45  agreements of the other party or conditions to such partys obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of
either party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute
a waiver of any of such rights.

SECTION 11.09. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of Article IX relating to indemnified

equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

SECTION 11.10. _Neutral Construction_. Seller and Purchaser agree that this
Agreement was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are
the product of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to
have been jointly and equally drafted by Seller and Purchaser, and the

the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision.

SECTION 11.11. _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any Delaware federal court sitting in the City of Wilmington;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any Delaware state court sitting in the City of Wilmington.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the
City of Wilmington for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment
or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. 

SECTION 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

thereunto duly authorized.
