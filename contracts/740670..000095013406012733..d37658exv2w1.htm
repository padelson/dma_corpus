ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;_ 
  _Company Equity Awards_   

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Sponsor Entity: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of MergerCos._ Each share of capital stock of each MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Certain Other Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock, or by any of the Sponsor Entities immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of Company Restricted Stock, but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and, except as provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $44.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time  ##### 

 

 

4 

represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared in accordance
with Section 4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. 

   

 (d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to MergerCos of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and MergerCos shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of MergerCos (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Fund._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, the Sponsor Entities shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option Amounts in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Sponsor Entities shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Option Amount, in each case as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").  ##### 

 

 

5    

 (b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II and any dividends declared in accordance with Section 4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay all dividends that may have been declared by the Company in accordance with Section 4.01(a) and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months after the  ##### 

 

 

6 

Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for,
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. 

   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Sponsor Entities or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration or any holder of a Company Stock Option to receive the Option Amount, in each case as provided herein. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights._ The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company Stock Option such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld  ##### 

 

 

7 

and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock or the holder of the Company Stock Option, as the case may be,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (such amount, the " _Option Amount_ "). Subject to Section 2.02(h), all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be paid as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, without interest. In the event that the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further force or effect. 

   

 (b) With respect to the ESPP, each participants accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c). The Company shall cause the ESPP to terminate at the Effective Time, and no further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_   

  

 SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by the Company and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Filed SEC Documents_ "), and, for the avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any change of fact or circumstance subsequent to the date such document was filed or furnished, or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is  ##### 

 

 

8 

reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant to such
other Section or subsection), the Company represents and warrants to the
Sponsor Entities as follows: 

   

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate, company or partnership power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to the Sponsor Entities prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws and the comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Subsidiary of the Company and the jurisdiction of organization thereof. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens.

 SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably requested by MergerCos to be obtained in connection with the Merger under the Specified Contracts and Real Property Leases,  #####

 _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee,
penalty or other consideration to any landlord or other person to obtain any
such consent, approval or waiver, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors
shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party shall voluntarily
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed and which reasonableness shall be determined in light of
each partys obligation to do all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Each
MergerCo and FinCo hereby agrees that, in the event of any failure to perform
or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement by one
MergerCo (or FinCo, as applicable), (x) the other MergerCo (or FinCo,
as applicable) shall be permitted to cure such failure, including by
performing such covenant or agreement on behalf of such first MergerCo (or
FinCo, as applicable) and, in the case of a failure by such first MergerCo
(or FinCo, as applicable) to perform or comply with its obligations
under Section 5.09(a), by obtaining the requisite Financing), and (y) until
and unless the other MergerCo (or FinCo, as applicable) shall have effected
such cure, it shall be deemed to have failed to perform and comply with its
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement to the same extent as
the first MergerCo (or FinCo, as applicable) has so failed with respect to its
covenants and agreements. 

   

 (b) The Company shall retain a nationally recognized investment banking or valuation firm, selected by the Board of Directors of the Company and reasonably acceptable to MergerCos, to render a solvency opinion, customary in scope and substance, as of the Closing to the Board of Directors of the Company.

Stock Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
provide compensation and benefits to each Company Employee that, taken as a
whole, have a value that is not less favorable in the aggregate (including
any value attributable to equity-based compensation) than the benefits
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor and continue during the two-year period following the Effective Time or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys employment, severance, retention, termination and cash incentive compensation plans, policies, programs, agreements or arrangements (including (i) any change in control severance agreement between the Company and any Company Employee, (ii) the Change in Control Severance Plan I, (iii) the Change in Control Severance Plan II, (iv) the Change in Control Bonus Program, (v) the Fiscal Year 2006 Bonus Enhancement Program and (vi) the Fiscal Year 2006 MIK Power Bonus Plan), in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable Law.

 (e) The Surviving Corporation shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting  ##### 

 

 

35   

periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not
have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,

or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 (b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company is or is threatened to be, made a party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective predecessors, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim, arising  #####

consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any

partners, members or stockholders or against any of their respective former,

limited partners, stockholders, managers, members or agents (each a "

 SECTION 5.08. _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give MergerCos the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without MergerCos prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 SECTION 5.09. _Financing._ (a) Each of the Sponsor Entities shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including, in the case of the Debt Financing, reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (or on other terms acceptable to FinCos, _provided_ such terms do not contain any conditions to funding on the Closing Date that are not set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments and would not otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing), (ii) to satisfy (or cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Sponsor Entities (or their Affiliates) set forth therein that are within the control of any of the Sponsor Entities (or such Affiliates) and (iii) to consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at the Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons providing such Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger at the Closing (including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and other persons providing such Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing). In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, FinCos shall promptly notify the Company, and the Sponsor Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, any such portion from alternative sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms that will still enable the Sponsor Entities to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that are not less favorable in the aggregate (as determined by FinCos in their reasonable judgment) to the Sponsor Entities and the Company than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitments. FinCos shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (excluding any fee letters and engagement letters which, by their terms are confidential, except to the extent any such letters contain conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing (including pursuant to so-called "flex" provisions)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide FinCos or the Surviving Corporation with any portion of the Debt Financing. In the event that (i) all or any portion of the high yield financing described in the Debt Financing Commitments has not been consummated, (ii) all closing conditions contained in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived (other  ##### 

 

 

40   

than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the prior or substantially concurrent satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) and (iii) the bridge
financing described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.09(a)) is available on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments (or a
replacement thereof as contemplated by this Section 5.09(a)), then the
Sponsor Entities shall borrow under and use, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to borrow under and use, such bridge financing (or
such Alternative Financing) in lieu of the high yield financing no later than
the last day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 30 consecutive days
following the later of (i) Stockholder Approval and (ii) September 4, 2006,
(A) throughout which (1) FinCos shall have the Required Financial
Information and (2) nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 not to be satisfied
assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such
consecutive 30-day period and (B) at the end of which the conditions set forth
in Section 6.01 shall be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Marketing Period shall not have commenced prior to November 1, 2006, as a
result of the failure of the condition set forth in clause (A)(1) above to
have been satisfied, then, subject to the Company having complied as of the
first day of the Marketing Period with its obligations under Section 5.09(b)
to use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Required Financial
Information, the Marketing Period shall be the first period of 30 consecutive
days after November 1, 2006, (x) throughout which (1) FinCos shall have the
Core Required Financial Information (as defined below) and (2) nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.02 not to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled for any time during such consecutive 30-day period and (B) at the
end of which the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 shall be satisfied,
and  _provided further_ , _however_ , that if the financial statements
included in the Required Financial Information or the Core Required Financial
Information, as the case may be, that is available to FinCos on the first day
of any such 30-day period would be "stale", within the meaning of Rule 3-12
of Regulation S-X, on any day during such 30-day period if a
registration statement using such financial statements were to be filed with
the SEC on such date, then a new 30-day period shall commence. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Core Required Financial Information_ " means
all financial statements for a high-yield financing during the Marketing
Period of the type required in a registered offering by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (other than Rule 3-10 of Regulation
S-X) that are customarily included in private placements pursuant to Rule
144A promulgated under the Securities Act, and, in the case of the annual
financial statements, the auditors report thereon. Each of the Sponsor
Entities shall refrain (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in any definitive
agreement related to the Financing. None of the Sponsor Entities shall agree
to or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any
of its rights under, any  Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, in each case, without the Companys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed),  ##### 

 

 

41   

except (i) in the case of the Equity Financing Commitment, as provided
therein, and (ii) in the case of the Debt Financing Commitment, as would not
contain any conditions to funding on the Closing Date that are not set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment and would not otherwise reasonably be
expected to impair or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing (it
being understood that, subject to the requirements of this clause (ii), such
amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments may
provide for the assignment of a portion of the Debt Financing Commitment to
additional agents or arrangers and granting such persons approval rights with
respect to certain matters as are customarily granted to additional agents
or arrangers). FinCos shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of their efforts to obtain the Debt Financing. 

   

 (b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by FinCos, including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, road shows and due diligence, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish FinCos and the financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by FinCos to consummate the Debt Financing, including all financial statements and financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (other than Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X) and of type and form customarily included in private placements pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (collectively, the " _Required Financial Information_ "), (iii) assisting FinCos and the financing sources in the preparation of (A) offering documents and other informational and marketing materials and documents for any portion of the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of FinCos and the financing sources for any portion of the Debt Financing, (v) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and execution and delivery of definitive financing documents and customary deliverables and (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, accountants consent letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by FinCos; _provided_ that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time; and _provided further_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. FinCos shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. FinCos shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.  #####

44   

shall not have occurred prior to such date solely as a result of the failure
of the Marketing Period to have been completed prior to such date, then the
Outside Date shall be extended to March 31, 2007; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of such party
(or in the case of MergerCos, any other Sponsor Entity) to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement, the failure to act in good faith or the
failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the

principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated
on or before such date; 

   

 (ii) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section 6.01(c) shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint; or

 (d) by the Company, if any Sponsor Entity shall have breached any of its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder;

 SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or MergerCos as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Company or any Sponsor Entity, other than the provisions of the last sentence of Section 5.02, Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to such provisions, any such termination shall not relieve the Company or any Sponsor Entity from liability for any willful and material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 7.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the Company and MergerCos (on behalf of themselves and FinCos) at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval having been obtained.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. No provision of this Agreement requiring any party to use reasonable best efforts or to act in good faith in any context shall be interpreted to require a party, as part of such partys duty to use reasonable best efforts or to act in good faith in the context in question, to waive any condition to the obligations of such party hereunder or to refrain from exercising any right or power such party may have hereunder. 

   

 SECTION 7.05. _Procedure for Termination or Amendment._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of MergerCos and the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, with respect to any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03, the duly authorized committee of its Board of Directors to the extent permitted by Law.

have been provided or made available to each of the Sponsor Entities. In the
event consent or approval of MergerCos is required pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and one MergerCo has provided such consent or approval, then
any withholding or delay of such consent or approval by the other MergerCo

 SECTION 8.05. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing. 

   

 SECTION 8.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the State of
Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition, subject to Section 5.06 and the provisions of the Guarantees
and the Equity Financing Commitments, to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)

sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that in the
event of a Non-Breach Financing Failure, the Companys sole remedy shall be
the payment of the Sponsor Termination Fee. 

   

 SECTION 8.11. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
