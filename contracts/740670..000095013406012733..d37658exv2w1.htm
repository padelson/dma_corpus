such holder&#146;s Appraisal Shares under Section&nbsp;262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt
notice to MergerCos of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
MergerCos shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with

written consent of MergerCos (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or

Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
which shall otherwise be in customary form) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a
Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered
if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this
Article&nbsp;II and any dividends declared in accordance with Section&nbsp;4.01(a) with a record date prior
to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to
the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.</U> All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates, <U>subject</U>, <U>however</U>, to the Surviving
Corporation&#146;s obligation to pay all dividends that may have been declared by the Company in
accordance with Section&nbsp;4.01(a) and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it
shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.

Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, Federal or other
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation,

such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker&#146;s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0&nbsp;billion (based
on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to the Surviving
Corporation. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration or any holder of a Company Stock Option to receive the Option Amount, in each case as
provided herein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Lost Certificates.</U> If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond or surety in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) <U>Withholding Rights.</U> The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company Stock Option such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld

The Company shall promptly notify MergerCos upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the

Delaware, this being in addition, subject to Section&nbsp;5.06 and the provisions of the Guarantees and
the Equity Financing Commitments, to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)&nbsp;consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware and any
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (c)&nbsp;agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of
Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that in the event of a Non-Breach Financing Failure, the Company&#146;s sole remedy shall
be the payment of the Sponsor Termination Fee.
