ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS 



   7.1 | _Liability for Taxes_. 
---|--- 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Contributing Parties shall be liable for,
and shall indemnify and hold the Partnership Indemnified Parties harmless from
the Partnership Parties Ownership Percentage of Taxes, together with any
costs, expenses, losses or damages, including reasonable expenses
of investigation and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and
expenses, arising out of or incident to the determination, assessment or
collection of such Taxes (" _Tax Losses_ "), (i) imposed on or incurred
by SemCrude Pipeline, White Cliffs Pipeline or their respective assets by
reason of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local
or foreign Law which is attributable to SemCrude Pipeline, White Cliffs
Pipeline or the Contributing Parties having been a member of any
consolidated, combined or unitary group for the period prior to and including
the Closing Date, (ii) any Tax Losses (other than Tax Losses described in
clause (i) above) imposed on or incurred by or with respect to SemCrude
Pipeline, White Cliffs Pipeline or their respective assets with respect to the
period prior to and including the Closing Date, but only to the extent such
Taxes are attributable to the Subject Interest or (iii) attributable to a
breach by the Contributing Parties of any covenant with respect to Taxes in
this Agreement. The Parties agree that any indemnification or payment
obligation under this _Section 7.1(a)_ of the Contributing Parties relating
to Tax Losses attributable to SemCrude Pipeline, White Cliffs Pipeline, or the
Transferred Assets shall be limited to a proportionate share of such Tax
Losses equal to the Partnership Parties Ownership Percentage.

 

(b) The Partnership Parties shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
the Contributing Indemnified Parties harmless from any Tax Losses
attributable to a breach by the Partnership Parties of any covenant with
respect to Taxes in this Agreement.

(c) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this _Article VII_ to determine
the amount of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by SemCrude Pipeline or White
Cliffs Pipeline for a taxable period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date which is allocable to the period prior to and including the
Closing Date, the determination shall be made, in the case of property or _ad
valorem_ Taxes or franchise Taxes (which are measured by, or based solely upon
capital, debt or a combination of capital and debt), on a _per diem_ basis
and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that such pre-Closing Date period
constitutes a separate taxable period

 



31  applicable to SemCrude Pipeline or White Cliffs Pipeline and by taking into
account the actual taxable events occurring during such period (except that
exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date that are calculated on an annual or periodic
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned to the
period prior to and including the Closing Date ratably on a  _per diem_
basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise Tax
paid or payable with respect to SemCrude Pipeline or White Cliffs Pipeline
shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income,
operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured,
regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is
obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

 

(d) If any of the Partnership Parties or their Affiliates receives a refund of
any Taxes that any of the Contributing Parties is responsible for hereunder,
or if the Contributing Parties or their Affiliates receive a refund of any
Taxes that any of the Partnership Parties is responsible for hereunder, the
party receiving such refund shall, within ninety (90) days after receipt
of such refund, remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes
hereunder. The Parties shall cooperate in order to take all necessary steps to
claim any such refund.



    7.2 | _Tax Returns_. 
---|--- 

(a) With respect to any Tax Return covering any taxable period that
is required to be filed with respect to SemCrude Pipeline, White Cliffs
Pipeline or the Transferred Assets, the Contributing Parties shall cause such
Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all
items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (" _Tax Items_ ") required
to be included therein, shall cause such Tax Return to be filed timely with
the appropriate Taxing Authority, and shall be responsible for the timely
remittance of payment (and deposit of any refund) of Taxes due with respect
to the period covered by such Tax Return. The Parties shall bear liability for
payment of Tax to the extent of their ownership percentage in each respective
entity during the period to which the Tax relates.

(b) All Tax Returns filed for any taxable period with respect to the
Transferred Assets shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting
practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question (unless such past
practices are no longer permissible under the applicable Law), and to the
extent any items are not covered by past practices (or in the event such
past practices are no longer permissible under the applicable Law), in
accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by the filing
party with respect to such Tax Return under this Agreement with the consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the non-filing party.



   7.3 | _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. 
---|--- 

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under this _Article VII_, shall be treated as increases or decreases to
the Cash Consideration for Tax purposes.

 



32 ---|--- 

The Contributing Parties shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "). Such Transfer Taxes shall be borne 100% by the
Contributing Parties. If required by applicable Law, the Partnership Parties
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.



   7.5 | _Survival_. 
---|--- 

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and
obligations of the Parties with respect to any Tax matter covered by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until thirty (30)
days after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations
(including all periods of extension and tolling) applicable to such Tax
matter.



   7.6 | _Conflict_. 
---|--- 

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this  _Article VII_ and
any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this _Article VII_
shall control.



   7.7 | _Tax Characterization of Transaction_. 
---|--- 

Immediately prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall borrow approximately
$115.8 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement to fund the Cash
Consideration (the " _Partnership Debt_ "). The Parties intend that the
Contributing Parties will be treated as receiving a distribution from the
Partnership at Closing: (a) first out of the proceeds of the Partnership Debt
as a "debt-financed transfer" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.707-5(b)(1) to the extent of the Contributing Parties allocable
share of the indebtedness incurred under the Partnership Debt under Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.707-5(a)(2) and 1.752-3(a)(3); (b) to the extent the
amount distributed to the Contributing Parties exceeds the
Contributing Parties allocable share of the indebtedness incurred under the
Partnership Debt as described in clause (a), as a reimbursement of the
Contributing Parties preformation expenditures with respect to the Subject
Interest within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d), to
the extent applicable; and (c) to the extent the amount distributed exceeds
the amounts described in clauses (a) and (b), in a transaction subject to
treatment under Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder as in part a sale, and in part a contribution, of the Subject
Interest to the Partnership to the extent that Treasury Regulations Sections
1.707-4(d) and 1.707-5(b)(1) are inapplicable. Unless otherwise required by a
final determination of the Internal Revenue Service, the Parties agree to act
at all times in a manner consistent with this intended treatment of the Cash
Consideration and the Partnership Debt, including disclosing the distribution
of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the requirements of Section
1.707-3(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

materially failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained herein
required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) there is
one or more inaccuracies, violations or breaches of the representations or
warranties of the other Party contained herein and such inaccuracies,
violations and breaches would constitute a Material Adverse Effect or
a Partnership Material Adverse Effect, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of clause (i) or (ii), the defaulting Party shall have a
period of ten (10) days following written notice from the non-defaulting
Party to cure any breach of this Agreement, if such breach is curable;

(d) by either the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or the Contributing
Parties, on the other hand, in writing, without liability, if there shall be

Authority binding on any of the Parties, which prohibits or restrains them
from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ that the
Parties shall have used their commercially reasonable efforts to have any such
order, writ, injunction or decree lifted) and the same shall not have been
lifted within thirty (30) days after entry by any such Governmental
Authority;

(e) by the Contributing Parties if any of the conditions set forth in

such termination shall be without liability and none of the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain effective or enforceable, except for those contained in

34  foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any Party of any
liability for any willful and material inaccuracy, violation or breach of any
representation or warranty of such Party or any willful and material breach
of any covenant or agreement of such Party under this Agreement or be deemed a
waiver of any available remedy (including specific performance, if available)
for any such breach.

of or arising out of (a) any inaccuracy, violation or breach of a
representation or warranty of the Contributing Parties in this Agreement or
any Contributing Parties Ancillary Document, (b) any breach of any agreement

   9.3 | _Tax Indemnification_. 
---|--- 

With the exception of any inaccuracy, violation or breach of
the representations and warranties of the Contributing Parties contained in
_Sections 3.3(a)(v)_ and _3.10_ , nothing in this _Article IX_ shall apply
to liability with respect to Taxes, the liability with respect to which
shall be as set forth in _Article VII_.

 



35 ---|--- 

(a) All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing, notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf
of any Party hereto or any Knowledge any such Party may have, _provided_ that
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ and in any certificate delivered in connection herewith with respect to
any of those representations and warranties, and the covenants and agreements
made under _Section 5.1_, shall terminate and expire at 12:01 a.m., Tulsa,
Oklahoma time, on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, except
(i) the representations and warranties of the Contributing Parties set forth

expired, no indemnification shall or may be sought pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)_, _Section 9.1(b)_, _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ by any
Person who would have been entitled pursuant to this _Article IX_ to
indemnification on the basis of such representation and warranty or agreement
or covenant prior to its termination and expiration, _provided_ that in the
case of each representation and warranty or covenant or agreement that shall
terminate and expire as provided in this _Section 9.4_, no claim presented in
writing for indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ on the basis of
such representation and warranty or agreement or covenant prior to its
termination and expiration shall be affected in any way by that termination
and expiration. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.4_, the
covenants and agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms
(or, in the absence of a stated term, in perpetuity).

 

(b) The indemnification obligations under this _Article IX_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall apply regardless of whether any suit or action results
solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence or strict
liability of the indemnified party.



   9.5 | _Demands_. 
---|--- 

(a) Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its
discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions
of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion,
claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such
claims for indemnity involving third party claims being collectively referred
to herein as the " _Indemnity Claim_ "), with respect to any matter as to
which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying
party (a " _Claim Notice_ "), together with a detailed statement of such
information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have and all
supporting evidence, including any Damages already incurred and its detailed
estimate of any Damages to be incurred in the future. Such notice shall
include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(b) If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient
time to permit the indemnifying

 



36  party or its counsel to defend against an Indemnity Claim and to make a
timely response thereto, the indemnifying partys indemnity obligation
relating to such Indemnity Claim shall be limited to the extent that such
failure has actually prejudiced or damaged the indemnifying party with respect
to that Indemnity Claim.

 

(c) With respect to any claim for indemnification not involving an Indemnity
Claim, the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have agreed to indemnify the
indemnified party pursuant to this _Article IX_ with respect to the claims
set forth in any Claim Notice if and to the extent the indemnifying party does
not provide the indemnified party notice of its disagreement with respect to
the contents of a Claim Notice within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt
thereof.



   9.6 | _Right to Contest and Defend_. 
---|--- 

(a) The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to
contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim
for which it is called upon to indemnify by the indemnified party under the
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that notice of the intention to
so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified
party within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying
party of notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity
Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such
contest shall be conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying
party and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the
indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate
in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at
its sole cost and expense.

 

(b) The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action
to be taken with respect thereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified
party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely
ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense or
injunctive relief. If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any
such Indemnity Claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result
obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying
party assumes the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that
the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely
affect the indemnified party as reasonably determined by the indemnified
party.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified
party in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money
damages against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages.

 



37 ---|--- 

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees
to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating without regard to any limitations set forth
in _Section 9.10_. At no cost or expense to the indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and its counsel
in contesting any Indemnity Claim.



   9.8 | _Right to Participate_. 
---|--- 

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons.



   9.9 | _Payment of Damages_. 
---|--- 

The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, within
ten (10) days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or Damages
are incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating
any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of
this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds received
and any indemnification reimbursement proceeds received from third parties.

 



   9.10 | _Limitations on Indemnification_. 
---|--- 

(a) To the extent that the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section
9.1(b)_, the Contributing Parties shall not be liable for such Damages until
the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds 1.0% of the dollar value of
the Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing Date (the " _Threshold Amount_
"), and then, subject to the following sentence, the Contributing Parties
shall be liable for all such Damages, whether incurred before or after the
Threshold Amount was exceeded. In no event shall the Contributing Parties
aggregate liability to the Partnership Indemnified Parties under _Section
9.1(a)_ exceed 15.0% of the dollar value of the Aggregate Consideration as of
the Closing Date (the " _Ceiling Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) the Threshold Amount shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or
breaches of representations and warranties contained in  _Sections 3.1_,
_3.2_ , _3.3(a)(v)_ , _3.4_ and _3.17_ (collectively, the " _Contributing
Parties Fundamental Representations_ ") and (ii) the Ceiling Amount shall not
apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of any of the Contributing
Parties Fundamental Representations, _provided_ the Contributing Parties
aggregate liability for a breach of the Contributing Parties Fundamental
Representations shall not exceed an amount equal to the dollar value of the
Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing Date.

 



38 (b) To the extent the Contributing Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section
9.2(b)_, the Partnership Parties shall not be liable for such Damages until
the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, and
then, subject to the following sentence, the Contributing Parties shall be
liable for all such Damages, whether incurred before or after the Threshold
Amount was exceeded. In no event shall the Partnership Parties aggregate
liability to the Contributing Indemnified Parties under _Section 9.2(a)_
exceed the Ceiling Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Threshold
Amount shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of
representations and warranties contained in  _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ , _4.4_
and _4.6_ (the " _Partnership Fundamental Representations_ ") and (ii) the
Ceiling Amount shall not apply to inaccuracies, violations or breaches of any
of the Partnership Fundamental Representations, _provided_ the Partnership
Parties aggregate liability for a breach of the Partnership Fundamental
Representations shall not exceed an amount equal to the dollar value of the
Aggregate Consideration as of the Closing Date.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted.]

 

(d) The Parties agree that any indemnification or payment obligation of the
Contributing Parties under _Section 9.1(a)_ (to the extent relating to any
inaccuracy, violation or breach of a representation or warranty in _Sections
3.1(b)_, _3.1(c)_ , _3.4(b)_ or _3.4(c)_ or in _Sections 3.5_ through _3.16_
) relating to Damages suffered or incurred by the Partnership Indemnified
Parties, attributable to SemCrude Pipeline or White Cliffs Pipeline or their
respective assets, businesses or operations, shall be limited to Damages
actually suffered or incurred by the Partnership Indemnified Parties. For
purposes of illustration (and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing), in the event any Damages are suffered or incurred by SemCrude
Pipeline or White Cliffs Pipeline, the Damages suffered or incurred by
the Partnership Parties would be 33.34% and 17% thereof, respectively.



   9.11 | _Sole Remedy_. 
---|--- 

Should the Closing occur, no Party shall have any liability under
this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby except as is provided in _Article VII_ or this
_Article IX_ (other than claims or causes of action arising from actual
fraud).

arising out of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby being
brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance
of such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.



   10.4 | _Public Statements_. 
---|--- 

The Parties shall consult with each other and no Party shall issue any public
announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other Parties, unless the Party
desiring to make such announcement or statement, after seeking such consent
from the other Parties, obtains advice from legal counsel that a public
announcement or statement is required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rules or regulations.



   10.5 | _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. 
---|--- 

(a) This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each Party to
this Agreement agrees that no other Party to this Agreement (including through
its agents and representatives) has made any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement to or with such Party relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than those expressly set forth herein
and in the Ancillary Documents.

(b) No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by each Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor
shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.



   10.6 | _Conflicting Provisions_. 
---|--- 

This Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents, read as a whole, set forth
the Parties rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, and as between them, specific provisions prevail over
general provisions. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, this Agreement shall control.

 



41 ---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, by any Party
hereto without the prior written consent of each other Party. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 10.7_, any Party may (without seeking the consent
of the other Parties) transfer or otherwise alienate any of its
rights, title, interest or obligations under this Agreement in connection
with (a) a transfer to an Affiliate which remains an Affiliate, (b) the
granting of a pledge, mortgage, hypothecation, Lien or other security
interest, (c) the foreclosure (judicial or non-judicial) or other settlement
or rearrangement pursuant to or in connection with any transfer made pursuant
to (b) above, (d) a transfer in connection with the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Party, if applicable, or (e) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange or other form of statutory
reorganization with another Person if such Party is the sole surviving Person.
Except as otherwise provided in _Article VII_ and  _Article IX_ with
respect to the Contributing Indemnified Parties and the Partnership
Indemnified Parties, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder.



   10.8 | _Severability_. 
---|--- 

If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared illegal
or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted
legislation, by decree of a court of last resort or any other Law, the
Partnership Parties and the Contributing Parties shall promptly meet and
negotiate in good faith substitute provisions for those rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.



   10.9 | _Interpretation_. 
---|--- 

It is expressly agreed by the Parties that neither this Agreement nor any of
the Ancillary Documents shall be construed against any Party, and no
consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted
this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any provision hereof or thereof or
who supplied the form of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents.
Each Party agrees that this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and
correctly reflects its understanding of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, therefore, waives the application of any Law or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 



   10.10 | _Headings and Disclosure Schedules_. 
---|--- 

(a) The headings of the several Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



42 (b) The Disclosure Schedules and the Exhibits referred to herein are attached
hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, and unless the context
expressly requires otherwise, the Disclosure Schedules and such Exhibits are
incorporated in the definition of " _Agreement_."

 

(c) Any matter disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to any section
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed by such disclosing
Parties for purposes of each other representation and warranty of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on
its face. The listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item in
the Disclosure Schedules shall be adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein if the nature and relevance of such
exception is reasonably apparent on its face from the listing (or inclusion of
a copy) of such document. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

 



   10.11 | _Multiple Counterparts_. 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.



   10.12 | _Action by Partnership Parties_. 
---|--- 

With respect to any action, notice, consent, approval or waiver that is
required to be taken or given or that may be taken or given by the Partnership
Parties prior to the Closing Date, such action, notice, consent, approval or
waiver shall be taken or given (a) if material, by the Conflicts Committee on
behalf of the Partnership Parties, and (b) if immaterial, by the Partnership
Parties directly.
