Section 1.02 _Effective Time_. The Company shall file a certificate of merger
that has been duly executed and acknowledged in accordance with, and in such
form as required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

no later than the second (2 _nd_ ) Business Day, after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ (except for
those conditions to the Closing that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
unless another time, date or place is mutually agreed to in writing by the
Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Closing Date_ " means the date on
which the Closing occurs.

Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL and other applicable
Law.

Section 1.05 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in

further amended as provided therein and in accordance with the DGCL, and (b)
the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in the Merger to read
in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_ , and as so amended and restated
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further

certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

 

Section 1.06 _Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers_. As of the
Effective Time, the Parties shall take all requisite action so that (a) the

the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, in each case, until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

 

ARTICLE II

_EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES_

Section 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company
Stockholder:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held in the Companys treasury or held
by the Company or any wholly owned Company Subsidiary (other than, in each
case, shares of Company Common Stock that are held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity and are beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)(ii)_, and subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.03_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive an amount equal to the Per-Share Amount; and

(iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation as of immediately after the Effective Time.

 



3 (b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, any change shall occur in the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock because of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange, readjustment or similar transaction, or if any
stock dividend shall be declared on shares of Company Common Stock and the
record date for such dividend shall fall during such period, then the Per-
Share Amount and any other similarly dependent terms shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the Company Stockholders and holders of Company Time-
Vested Options, Company Performance-Vested Options, Company LTIP Options,
Company Inducement Options, Company RSUs (other than Company Non-Employee
RSUs), Company LTIP PSUs, Company Non-LTIP PSUs, Company Inducement PSUs,
Company Non-Employee Options and Company Non-Employee RSUs (collectively, the
" _Company Equity Awards_ ") the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any
such change that it is not authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the cancellation or conversion
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01_, shall cease to exist, and
all holders of stock certificates (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as Company Stockholders, except the right to receive the Per-
Share Amount with respect to each share of Company Common Stock evidenced
thereby as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ upon the surrender of such shares
of Company Common Stock (or to appraisal rights as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.03_ with respect to Dissenting Shares), and (ii) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon conversion and surrender
of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock (subject to any rights with respect to Dissenting
Shares). No further transfer of any such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") and shall enter into an agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to services to be
performed by the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time but after
the Education Closing, (i) the Company shall cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent an amount in cash from its available cash on hand (including the
proceeds received by the Company in the Education Transaction), which amount
(1) shall be determined by Parent following consultation with the Company (
_provided_ that the deposit of such amount with the Paying Agent shall not
violate any applicable Law) by providing written notice to the Company no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (2) when paid
to the Company Stockholders, shall be deemed a redemption of such Company
Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock on a pro rata basis (such amount,
the " _Redemption Cash Amount_ "), and (ii) Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash, which when

 



4  combined with the Redemption Cash Amount, shall be no less than the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ (the " _Parent Cash
Amount_ " together with the Redemption Cash Amount, the " _Payment Fund_ ");
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no minimum
requirement for the Redemption Cash Amount. 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to commence mailing to each Person who
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock (i) in the case of Stock Certificates, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery of Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock
Certificates shall pass, upon delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and (B) customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates, and (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares, in each
case, in exchange for the Per-Share Amount with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock evidenced by such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable. Upon (1) in the case of Stock Certificates, delivery
to the Paying Agent of Stock Certificates, together with a validly executed
letter of transmittal, or (2) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the
Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form and such
other evidence of surrender, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request, the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the Per-Share Amount
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and the Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid
in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if (I) such
Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or such Stock Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (II) the
Person requesting such payment shall either (x) pay any transfer tax required
by reason of such payment or (y) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent that such transfer tax either
has been paid in full or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_, each Stock Certificate and Book-Entry
Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Per-Share Amount with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock evidenced thereby. No interest shall be
paid on the Per-Share Amount payable upon surrender of any Stock Certificate
or Book-Entry Share.

(d) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, and if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in a customary amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may reasonably require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Company, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to such
Person the Per-Share Amount receivable with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate.

 



5 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to former holders of Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares 270 days after the Closing Date shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any former holders of Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent for payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration, in
accordance with this _Article II_ and without any interest thereon, payable
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock previously evidenced by
such Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person
for the portion of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior
to the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time, any unclaimed funds
payable with respect to such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) such investments shall be
in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States, or in commercial paper obligations of
issuers organized under the Law of a state of the Unites States of America,
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, and (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent upon demand. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through
any investment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_, nothing in this Agreement and no investment losses
resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any
holder of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive, or Parents and
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay, such holders applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be, in its reasonable
discretion, required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under any applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
under no circumstances will the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent deduct or withhold any amount under Section
1445 of the Code. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary
to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts so deducted or withheld
and timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

Section 2.03 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any share of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is
entitled to demand,

 



6  and has made a valid demand, for appraisal of such share in accordance, and
complies in all respects, with Section 262 of the DGCL (each such share, a "
_Dissenting Share_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per-Share Amount in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(iii)_ but instead
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the "fair value" of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any Dissenting Shares lose their status as such (through
failure to perfect, waiver, effective withdrawal or otherwise), then, as of
the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, each such
Dissenting Share shall automatically be converted into or shall be deemed to
have been, as of the Effective Time, converted into, as applicable, and shall
represent only the right to receive, the Per-Share Amount in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(iii)_, after the surrender of the Stock
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, representing such shares
in accordance with this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt
written notice of any written demand for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served on the Company in connection therewith
pursuant to the DGCL prior to the Effective Time and (b) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for
appraisal. The Company shall not make any payment, settle or offer to settle,
approve the withdrawals of any demands, or, in each case, agree to do any of
the foregoing, with respect to any such demand without Parents prior written
consent.

Section 2.04 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Time-Vested Option that is held by any
Health Care Employee and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted
into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an
" _Adjusted Time-Vested Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Time-Vested Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Time-Vested Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award Conversion
Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number
of shares. The exercise price per share of such Adjusted Time-Vested Option
shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Time-Vested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time _divided by_ (2) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with
any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents. The
exercise price per share of any such Adjusted Time-Vested Option and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock relating to any such Adjusted Time-
Vested Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Time-
Vested Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Performance-Vested Option that is held
by any Health Care Employee and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted
into an option to purchase a

 



7  number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Performance-
Vested Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Performance-Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Company Performance-Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall not apply from and after the Effective Time), equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Performance-Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied
by_ (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares. The exercise price per
share of such Adjusted Performance-Vested Option shall be equal to the
quotient of (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Performance-Vested Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time _divided by_ (2) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any
fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents. The
exercise price per share of any such Adjusted Performance-Vested Option and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock relating to any such Adjusted
Performance-Vested Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company
Performance-Vested Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company LTIP Option that is held by any Health
Care Employee and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted into an
option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "
_Adjusted LTIP Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company LTIP Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company LTIP Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares;
_provided_ that prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a committee
thereof shall equitably adjust the performance-vesting conditions applicable
to such Company LTIP Option in accordance with the methodology set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The exercise price per
share of such Adjusted LTIP Option shall be equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company LTIP
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher
number of whole cents. The exercise price per share of any such Adjusted LTIP
Option and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock relating to any such
Adjusted LTIP Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company LTIP
Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU other than a Company Non-Employee
RSU that is held by any Health Care Employee and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of
Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ "), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and relating to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal

 



8  to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.

(e) At the Effective Time, each Company LTIP PSU that is held by any Health
Care Employee and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted into a restricted
stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
LTIP PSU_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company LTIP PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company LTIP PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower
whole number of shares; _provided_ that prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board or a committee thereof shall equitably adjust the performance-
vesting conditions applicable to such Company LTIP PSU in accordance with
the methodology set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(f) At the Effective Time, each Company Non-LTIP PSU that is held by any
Health Care Employee and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted
into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock
(each, an " _Adjusted Non-LTIP PSU_"), on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company Non-LTIP PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that any performance-based vesting conditions
applicable to such Company Non-LTIP PSU immediately prior the Effective Time
shall not apply from and after the Effective Time), and relating to a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Non-LTIP PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower
whole number of shares.

(g) At the Effective Time, any Company Non-Employee Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be canceled and converted into (i) the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Per-Share Amount over (B) the per-share exercise price for
such Company Non-Employee Option, _multiplied by_ (2) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Non-Employee Option
(the " _Company Non-Employee Option Consideration_"); _provided_ that if the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of any such Company Non-
Employee Option is equal to or greater than the Per-Share Amount, such
Company Non-Employee Option shall be canceled without any cash payment or
other consideration being made in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the
payroll of the Surviving Corporation to each holder of a Company Non-Employee
Option the Company Non-Employee Option Consideration (if any), less any
required withholding Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

 



9 (h) At the Effective Time, each Company Non-Employee RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
canceled and converted into (i) the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Non-Employee RSU, _multiplied by_
(2) the Per-Share Amount (the " _Company Non-Employee RSU Consideration_").
The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (to the
extent applicable) to each holder of a Company Non-Employee RSU the Company
Non-Employee RSU Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes, within
two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time; _provided_ that to the
extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest
date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

other actions that are necessary to effect, the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

 

(k) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary for the assumption and conversion of each Company Time-Vested
Option, Company Performance-Vested Option, Company LTIP Option, Company RSU
(other than each Company Non-Employee RSU), Company LTIP PSU and Company Non-
LTIP PSU pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_. Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under
the Securities Act, with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock subject to

Offering shall commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this

payroll contribution rate pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in
effect when the Final Offering commenced or (ii) make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the

 



10  consummation of the Merger, (A) cause the Final Offering, to the extent that
it would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time, to be terminated no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective
Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to
reflect the Final Offering, but otherwise treat the Final Offering as a fully
effective and completed Offering for all purposes pursuant to the Company
ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to the Company ESPP. On such exercise date, the
Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company
ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of
whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP, and each share of Company Common Stock shall be an outstanding

of all leases, subleases and license agreements for each Leased Real Property
(collectively, the " _Real Property Leases_ "), including the street address
thereof, title of and parties to the applicable Real Property Lease, an

such that each such Real Property Lease shall be held by the
Education Business or health care business, as set forth in _Section_ __ _

waivers, Priming Documents, and side letters thereto) have been made available
to Parent. The Leased Real Property constitutes all of the real property
utilized by the Post-Sale Company Entities, and all such Leased Real Property
is in good operating condition and repair. The Post-Sale Company Entities have
good and valid leasehold interests in and to, and undisturbed possession of,
each of the Leased Real Property, in each case, except as set forth in

Property Leases, or the Leased Real Property thereunder, are subject to any

and a financial advisor) that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board
may not make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the
Company Board has delivered to Parent prior written notice that the Company

officers or employees of the Post-Sale Company Entities as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents and any written indemnification or other
similar Contracts of any Post-Sale Company Entity that are set forth in

 



54   _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Company
Indemnity Agreements_ "), in each case, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and the other Post-Sale Company Entities to perform
their respective obligations thereunder. For a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not permit any indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation provision in such Organizational
Documents or any Company Indemnity Agreement to be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Company Indemnified Parties thereunder, unless any such amendment, repeal or
modification is required by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing,
for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who is a current or former director, officer or employee of any Post-Sale
Company Entity and each individual who becomes, prior to the Effective Time,
a director, officer or employee of any Post-Sale Company Entity or who is, as
of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the
Effective Time, serving at the request of any Post-Sale Company Entity as a
director, officer or employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer or employee of any Post-Sale Company Entity or is or was
serving at the request of any Post-Sale Company Entity as a director, officer
or employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable
Organizational Document and required under the applicable Company Indemnity
Agreement, if any. In the event of any such Claim, each Company Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to advancement of reasonable and documented expenses
incurred in the defense of any such Claim from Parent to the fullest extent
permitted under the applicable Organizational Document and required under the
applicable Company Indemnity Agreement, if any, after receipt by Parent from
the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;  _provided_ that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. Any determination required to be made with respect
to whether any Company Indemnified Partys conduct complies with an
applicable standard under the applicable Organizational Documents of the Post-
Sale Company Entities or applicable Company Indemnity Agreements, as the case
may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Company
Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their successors or assigns, as applicable, shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their successor or assigns, as applicable, to assume
the covenants and agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 



55 (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance coverage, with a duration of not less than
six (6) years, for the Company and its current and former directors, officers
and employees who are covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, with such
"tail" to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage
and to have terms not less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time for a period of not less than
six (6) years after the Closing Date; _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one (1) policy year exceed the
200% of the current aggregate annual premium. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect for the
duration of such policy.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, all of which, are express third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2018 (such period, the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who is
employed by a Post-Sale Company Entity immediately prior to the Effective Time
and who remains employed thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any of their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (1) base
salary or wage rate and incentive compensation opportunity (excluding any
equity incentives and the Company ESPP, any retention or transaction bonuses
or special one-time payments) no less favorable than those provided to each
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) employee
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation awards and the Company ESPP)
that (A) are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or, in Parents
discretion, (B) are no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation Period, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to provide, severance payments and benefits to each Company
Employee whose employment is terminated during such period that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits that such Company Employee
is eligible to receive under any applicable severance plan, policy, practice
or arrangement sponsored or maintained by any Post-Sale Company Entity in
accordance with the terms of such arrangement as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, assume and
honor the employment, severance, retention, termination and change of control
plans, policies, programs,

 



56  agreements and arrangements listed in _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including such terms pertaining to
any right to amend or terminate. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Closing
shall constitute a "change in control" (or similar term) of the Company under
the terms of the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable.

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual or other plan providing for post-employment benefits, or for
purposes of eligibility for retirement vesting under the equity incentive
plans of Parent) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (exclusive of any Company Entity) providing benefits to any
Company Employee after the Closing Date, which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude any employee benefit plans that are frozen or grandfathered as
of the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with any Company Entity and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to the extent coverage under
such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Company Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (1) all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of any
Post-Sale Company Entity in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date (except that, such waiver shall not
apply to any insurance policy of Parent that imposes an actively-at-work
requirement or to Parents employee supplemental life insurance election
options, with or without "Accidental Death and Dismemberment," of (A) one (1)
times or two (2) times salary for coverage greater than $500,000 or (B) three
(3) times or four (4) times salary, to the extent such evidence of
insurability is required under Contract by Parents employee supplemental life
insurance) and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan, subject to the Company providing
adequate data to Parent, in a format required by Parent.

 

(d) _Company Incentive Plan_.

 



57 (i) For the year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each participant in an annual
incentive plan or program maintained by any Post-Sale Company Entity (each, a
" _Company Incentive Plan_ ") a cash bonus in respect of such plan year in an
amount equal to the cash bonus amount payable under the applicable Company
Incentive Plan based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance criteria for such plan year, with such level of achievement (1)
measured during the period from and including the first date of such plan
year through and including the end of the calendar month immediately preceding
the month in which the Closing Date occurs, (2) determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice but without regard to any costs and expenses
associated with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any non-
recurring events that would not reasonably be expected to have affected the
Post-Sale Company Entities had the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
not arose, and (3) annualized through the end of the quarter in which the
Closing Date occurs. Such bonus amounts shall be paid, less any required
withholding Taxes, on or about the date on which the Company would normally
pay annual bonuses in the first calendar quarter of the year following the
year in which the Closing Date occurs and in no event later than March 15 of
the year following the year in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if earlier,
upon a termination of employment as set forth in clause (ii) below). Following
the completion of the quarter in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent, in
its sole discretion, may choose to continue the participation of any Company
Employee in a Company Incentive Plan or transition such employee to an
incentive plan of Parent, subject to the terms of  _ 
Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_.

(ii) If a Company Employee experiences a termination of employment following
the Effective Time and prior to the payment of the bonus amount provided in
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(d)(i)_ (the " _Annual Bonus Amount_ ") under
circumstances that entitle such Company Employee to receive severance under
a Company Benefit Plan or applicable statutory requirements, such Company
Employee shall receive a lump sum cash bonus equal to such Company Employees
Annual Bonus Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days from and including the first date of such plan year through
and including the date of such Company Employees termination of employment,
and the denominator of which is 365; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of a
prorated bonus amount provided to such Company Employee under the terms of an
applicable Company Benefit Plan. Such bonus shall be paid, less any required
withholding Taxes, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
such Company Employees termination of employment.

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is reasonably necessary to terminate the Companys Executive Non-
Qualified Excess Plan, effective as of the day prior to the Effective Time, in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance thereunder. If the
Companys Executive Non-Qualified Excess Plan is terminated as described
herein, any participant in such plan who satisfies the eligibility
requirements to participate in a similar non-qualified deferred compensation
plan maintained by Parent shall be eligible to commence participation in such
similar plan maintained by Parent.

 



58 (f) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is reasonably necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan
(the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. In
the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has
been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) not later
than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In such event, the
Company and Parent shall take any and all action as may be required, including
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parents or its Affiliates
applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to permit the Company
Employees to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash or
notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the
Parent 401(k) Plan. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as described
herein, each Company Employee shall be eligible to commence participation in
a Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as administratively practicable after the Closing
Date.

(g) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with such request to be
made only in the event Parent does not request that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.11(f)_), the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is reasonably necessary to delegate plan administration authority
for the Company 401(k) Plan to UnitedHealth Group Incorporateds Employee
Benefits Plans Administrative Committee and investment authority for the
Company 401(k) Plan to UnitedHealth Group Incorporateds Employee Benefits
Plans Investment Committee, effective as of the Closing Date and contingent
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that the Company delegate such authority with respect to the Company 401(k)
Plan, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence of such delegation (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent)
not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to

_Section_ __ _ 6.01_, _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_,
as applicable, and (2) (A) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the

Section 7.03 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) _Company Termination Fee; Parent Expenses_.

 



65 (i) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.01(c)(i)_, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $42,000,000 in cash (the
" _Company Termination Fee_ ") (to an account designated in writing by Parent)
concurrently with or prior to such termination.

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)(i)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee (to
an account designated in writing by Parent) no later than two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination; _provided_ that if either the Company
or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_
or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(iii)_ at any time after Parent would have been
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)(i)_,
this Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)(i)_ for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(ii)_.

 

(iii) If (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event shall have occurred at
any time following the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_
or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)(ii)_ and (B) at any time on or prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after such termination, any Post-Sale Company Entity enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummates any transaction included
within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that, for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)_, references in the definition of
Company Takeover Proposal to "20% or more" shall be deemed references to "50%
or more") (a " _Company Takeover Transaction_ ") (whether or not involving the
same Company Takeover Proposal as that which was the subject of the Pre-
Termination Takeover Proposal Event), then the Company shall pay Parent the
Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent)
in immediately available funds upon the earlier of entering into such
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Transaction or the
consummation of such Company Takeover Transaction.

 

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(iv)_ or (2) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)(iii)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee (
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
7.03(a)(iv)_, the amount of the Company Termination Fee shall be $42,000,000)
in cash, not later than two (2) Business Days after such termination.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company
is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under  _Section_ __ _
7.03(a)_ (including _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(iv)_), then, except in the case of
any fraud committed by the Company or any willful breach of this Agreement,
upon receipt of the Company Termination Fee (including the Company
Termination Fee in the amount specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(iv)_) by
Parent, the Company shall have no further Liability with respect to this
Agreement, the Education Purchase Agreement or the Transactions to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
payment of the Company Termination Fee (including the Company Termination Fee
in the amount specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(iv)_) shall be Parents
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent
and Parents Subsidiaries. In no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion, including after the
Company has

 



66  paid the Company Termination Fee in the amount specified in _Section_ __ _
7.03(a)(iv)_ and a Company Termination Fee would otherwise have become payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(iii)_.

(c) The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without such provisions,
the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.03(a)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred by Parent in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)_ and (ii) the Company shall pay to
Parent interest on such unpaid amount from and including the date payment of
such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime
rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made plus 5%. Each Party acknowledges and agrees,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that the payment of the Company
Termination Fee is not a penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates in the circumstances in which the Company Termination
Fee is payable, and which do not involve any fraud committed by the Company or
willful breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and
the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

 

Section 7.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified and
supplemented in any and all respects any time prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be
made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the Company
Stockholders without the further approval thereof, (b) no amendment shall be
made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (c) except as provided in
the foregoing clause (a), no amendment of this Agreement shall require
the approval of the stockholders of Parent or the Company Stockholders. Any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be effective only if it is
set forth in an instrument in writing executed by each Party.

 

Section 7.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_, waive
compliance with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement or (d) waive
the satisfaction of any of the conditions in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives
its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ with respect thereto. Upon any
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law to the
end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

Section 8.05  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one (1) or
more counterparts (including by means of email in .pdf format), each of which
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall be considered one and

Parties.

 



69 Section 8.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement, taken together with the Confidentiality Agreement (except
for paragraphs 5, 8 and 10 of the Confidentiality Agreement, which paragraphs
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of, and be of no further
force or effect from and after, the date of this Agreement), constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between or among the Parties or their Affiliates,
including paragraphs 5, 8 and 10 of the Confidentiality Agreement, with
respect to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

 

(b) Except (i) as expressly provided in this Agreement, including _Section_ __
_ 5.10_, (ii) after the Effective Time, for _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, each of which is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the holders of Company Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which holders are express third-
party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ from
and after the Effective Time, (iii) after the Effective Time, for  _Section_
__ _ 2.04_, which is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the holders of Company Equity Awards as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, which holders are express third-party beneficiaries of
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ from and after the Effective Time, and (iv) for
_Section_ __ _ 5.01(e)_, the last two sentences of _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_, each of which is intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, Education Buyer, each Party agrees that (1) their
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (2) this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies
under this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based on,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,
performance, consummation or subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

Section 8.08  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent or Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the ultimate parent entity of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder. Any other
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 8.09 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached or threatened to be

 



70  breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article VII_ , the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of
a Party to cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any court referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_, without proof of actual damages (and each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement. If any Party brings any Claim to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the End Date shall
automatically be extended by (a) the period of time between the commencement
of such Claim and the date on which such Claim is fully and finally resolved,
_plus_ twenty (20) Business Days, _plus_ (b) any such other time period as
finally determined by the court presiding over such Claim.

 

Section 8.10 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Each of the Parties hereby (a) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the sole and exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in
the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware) (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in connection with any
Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in any of the Delaware Courts, (c) agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that such Claim brought therein has been
brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for
leave from any such court and (d) agrees that it will not bring any Claim in
connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any court or other tribunal,
other than any of the Delaware Courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that service of process in connection with any
Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be made upon such party by prepaid
certified or registered mail, with a validated proof of mailing receipt
constituting evidence of valid service, directed to such party at the address
specified in  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ hereof. Service made in such manner, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or prohibit service of
process by any other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY CLAIM, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER

 



71  AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 8.11_.

Section 8.12 _Construction_. Each Party has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 8.13  _Interpretation_.

(a) _Time Periods_. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or after which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
