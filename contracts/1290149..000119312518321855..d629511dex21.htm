Net Sales shall also include, with respect to any Contingent Payment Products
sold or otherwise disposed of for any consideration other than an exclusively
monetary consideration on bona fide arms length terms, an amount equal to the
higher of (i) the fair market value of all consideration received and (ii)
the average sales price for such Contingent Payment Products having the same
dosage form and strength during the applicable reporting period in the country
where such sale or other disposal occurred when such Contingent Payment
Product is sold alone and not with other products, or if such Contingent
Payment Product is not sold alone in such country during the applicable
reporting period, then an amount equal to the average sales price during the
applicable reporting period generally achieved for such Contingent Payment
Product having the same dosage form and strength in the rest of the world (or
if such Contingent Payment Product is not sold having the same dosage form and
strength in the rest of the world, Buyer and Seller shall discuss
an appropriate determination of Net Sales for the Contingent Payment Product,
and the amount shall equal the amount that is mutually agreed upon by the
Parties in good faith, following discussion by Buyer and Seller, based on a
mutually agreed upon equitable method of determining the same that takes into
account, in the country where such sale or disposal occurred, variations in
dosage form and strength).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Net Sales shall exclude any consideration
received with respect to any sale, use or other distribution for use in a
clinical trial or other development activity, for compassionate or named-
patient use or for use as samples or in test marketing, in each case where
Contingent Payment Products are provided at or below cost.

 

If a Contingent Payment Product consists of or contains a combination of the
Product (or the active ingredient in the Product) with one or more other
active ingredients, whether sold as a fixed dose combination or as separate
doses sold together in a single package as one product (a "Combination
Product"), the Net Sales for such Combination Product shall be calculated on
a country-by-country basis as follows:

 

(a) If one or more Persons separately sells in such country, (A) a product
containing as its sole active ingredient the active ingredient in the Product
in the Combination Product (the "Mono Product") and (B) products containing as
their sole active ingredients, the other active ingredients in such
Combination Product, the Net Sales attributable to such Combination Product
shall be calculated by multiplying actual Net Sales of such Combination
Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where "A" is the weighted (by sales volume)
average sales price (during the period to which the Net Sales calculation
applies) for the Mono Product in such country and "B" is the weighted (by
sales volume) average sales price (during the period to which the Net Sales
calculation applies) in such country, for products that contain as their sole
active ingredients the other active ingredients in such Combination Product.

(b) If one or more Persons separately sells in such country the Mono
Product, but one or more Persons does not separately sell in such country
products containing as their sole active ingredients, the other active
ingredients in such Combination Product, the Net Sales attributable to such
Combination Product shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of such
Combination Product by the fraction A/C, where "A" is the weighted (by sales
volume) average sales price (during the period to which the Net Sales
calculation applies) for the Mono Product in such country, and "C" is the
weighted (by sales volume) average sales price (during the period to which the
Net Sales calculation applies) for such Combination Product in such country.

(c) If one or more Persons does not separately sell in such country the
Mono Product, but one or more Persons does separately sell in such country
products containing as their sole active ingredients, the other active
ingredients contained in such Combination Product, the Net Sales attributable
to such Combination Product shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales
of such Combination Product by the fraction (D-E)/D where: "D" is the weighted
(by sales volume) average sales price (during the period to which the Net
Sales calculation applies) for such Combination Product in such country and
"E" is the weighted (by sales volume) average sales price (during the period
to which the Net Sales calculation applies) in such country for products that
contain as their sole active ingredients the other active ingredients in such
Combination Product.

(d) If one or more Persons does not separately sell in such country both
the Mono Product and products containing as their sole active ingredients, the
other active ingredient in such Combination Product, the Net Sales
attributable to such Combination Product shall be agreed upon by the Parties
in good faith (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
following discussion by Buyer and Seller, based on a mutually agreed upon
equitable method of determining the relative fair market value of such Mono
Product and such other active ingredient or ingredients.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all active ingredients in a
Combination Product are Covered by one or more Purchased Patent Rights, the
foregoing subsections (a)  (d) shall not apply to calculating Net Sales for
such Combination Product.

Sales Milestone achieved during the fourth ( _i.e._ , the last) calendar
quarter of a calendar year, within [***] after the end of the calendar quarter
in which such Net Sales Milestone is achieved. Buyer shall notify Seller as
soon as reasonably practicable (i) but no more than [***] Business Days after
each Initiation Milestone and each Approval Milestone is first achieved and
(ii) but no more than [***] days after the end of the applicable calendar
quarter in which each Net Sales Milestone is achieved if achieved during the

Period" means the later of (1) expiration of the [***] year period following
the First Commercial Sale of such Contingent Payment Product in such
country, (2) expiration of the last-to-expire Valid Claim that Covers such
Contingent Payment Product in such country and (3) expiration of [***] for
such Contingent Payment Product in such country.

(ii) Beginning on the date that, and solely for so long as, a Contingent
Payment Product is sold in a country and is not Covered by a Valid Claim in
such country, then for the purposes of calculating the Royalties attributable
to Net Sales of such Contingent Payment Product, the Net Sales of such
Contingent Payment Product in such country shall be reduced by [***]. For
clarity, if such reduction is applied with respect to a Contingent Payment
Product in a country based on the foregoing, and such Contingent Payment
Product is later Covered by a Valid Claim in such country, such reduction
shall no longer apply so long as a Valid Claim Covers such Contingent Payment
Product in such country, provided that, for clarity, no retroactive payment
shall be due for that period during which such Contingent Payment Product was
not Covered by a Valid Claim in such country.

(b) _Royalty Reports_. Within [***] days following the end of each of the
first three calendar quarters of each calendar year and within [***] days
following the end of each fourth ( _i.e._ , last) calendar quarter of each
calendar year, commencing with the calendar quarter in which the First
Commercial Sale of the first Contingent Payment Product occurs, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a report containing the following information for the
applicable calendar quarter, on a country-by-country, product-by-product
basis: (i) the amount of gross sales (including the number and size of units
of Contingent Payment Products), (ii) the calculation of Net Sales (including
each of the deductions used to calculate such amount) and (iii) the
calculation of the Royalties. If no Royalties or other payments are payable

faith to make available to Seller other financial information
reasonably requested by Seller in connection with financial reporting
obligations.

(c) _Records; Audits_. Buyer shall, and shall cause each other Buyer
Related Party to, maintain complete and accurate records in sufficient detail

Milestone Events. Upon reasonable prior written notice, such records (for
periods that have not previously been audited) shall be available not more
than once each calendar year during regular business hours for a period of
[***] years from the end of the calendar year to which they pertain (or such
longer period to the extent required by applicable Law) for examination by an
independent certified public accountant selected by Seller and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer (and subject to such independent certified public
accountant executing an appropriate confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreement with the audited party), for the sole purpose of verifying the
accuracy of the payments made hereunder. Any amounts shown to be owed but

shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit discloses (i) an
underpayment by Buyer of more than [***] of the applicable amount due [***].

(50%) by Seller. The Party responsible for filing any Tax Return with respect
to such Transfer Taxes shall properly and promptly file such Tax Return.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable
efforts to minimize the Transfer Taxes attributable to the transfer of the
Purchased Assets, including by effecting the delivery of the Purchased Assets
in such a manner as is legally permitted to mitigate such Transfer Taxes, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any exemption or other
similar certificate from any Governmental Authority as may be necessary
to mitigate such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall reimburse the other
Party for any Transfer Taxes paid by the applicable Party in excess of the
amount allocated to such Party by this Section 2.11(a).

 

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct from the amounts payable under this
Agreement the proper amount of withholding Taxes required to be withheld
under applicable Tax Law as determined by Buyer in its reasonable discretion,
and Buyer shall timely and properly remit any amounts withheld under this
Section 2.11(b) to the appropriate Governmental Authority on behalf of
Seller. To the extent Buyer is required to withhold any amounts in respect of
Taxes with respect to payments made pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall
promptly deliver to Seller proof of payment of all such Taxes, together with
copies of all communications

 from or with such Governmental Authority with respect thereto. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable efforts to
eliminate or minimize any withholding Taxes applicable with respect to
payments made pursuant to this Agreement, including providing appropriate
forms, including Internal Revenue Service forms W-9 or W-8BEN-E, to eliminate
or reduce any such withholding. Amounts withheld pursuant to this Section
2.11(b) will be treated as paid to Seller hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Buyer (i) assigns, delegates or otherwise transfers any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate or successor
pursuant to Section 2.17, Section 7.12(a) or Section 7.12(b), and such
Affiliate or successor is required by applicable Law to deduct or withhold
Taxes in respect of any amounts payable under this Agreement at a rate higher
than the rate at which Buyer would have been required to deduct or withhold
Taxes if such assignment or transfer had not occurred, or (ii) takes any
other similar action that causes Buyer to be required to deduct or withhold
Taxes in respect of any amounts payable under this Agreement at a rate higher
than if such action had not been taken, then the sum payable under this
Agreement shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions or any required withholding (including deductions and withholding
with respect to additional sums payable under this Section 2.11(b)) Seller
shall receive an amount equal to the sum that would have been paid if such
assignment or transfer had not been made, or action had not been taken, as
applicable. Additional amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to this Section
2.11(b) are referred to as "Additional Amounts". For clarity, in the event of
any assignment, delegation or other transfer of rights or obligations by
Seller pursuant to Section 7.12, the Additional Amounts shall not exceed the
Additional Amounts that would have been payable had such assignment,
delegation or other transfer of rights or obligations not occurred. If Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, assigns, delegates or otherwise transfers any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate or
successor pursuant to Section 2.17, Section 7.12(a) or Section 7.12(b), the
provisions of this Section 2.11(b) shall apply with respect to such Affiliate
or successor, as applicable.

 

(c) Except for Taxes covered by Sections 2.11(a) and 2.11(b), each Party
shall be responsible for any Tax obligations of its own due to this Agreement
(including income tax not withheld at source and capital gains tax). Subject
to Section 2.5(a) and Article VI, neither Party shall have any obligation
towards the other Party in the event that the other Party fails to fully
comply with its Tax obligations.

Section 2.12 _Payments_.

 

(a) Without limiting either Partys right to assert or obtain damages for
breaches of this Agreement, Buyers right to set off as set forth in Section
6.5(d) hereto and solely with respect to Royalties, Buyers right to true-up
accruals of amounts reflected in Net Sales in accordance with the definition
for "Net Sales" set forth herein, all Milestone Payments and Royalties to be
paid to Seller hereunder shall be non-refundable and noncreditable. All
payments to be made to Seller in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement will be made by wire transfer in U.S. Dollars of immediately
available funds to the credit of Sellers bank account as may be designated in
writing by Seller from time to time.

(b) Buyer agrees, in determining amounts hereunder, it will use Buyers
then current standard procedures and methodology generally applied by Buyer or
its Affiliates in preparing its audited financial statements for the
applicable calendar quarter including Buyers then current standard exchange
rate methodology for the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S.
Dollars or, in the case of Selling Persons who are not Affiliates of Buyer,
such similar methodology, consistently applied. Buyer will inform Seller as to
the specific exchange rate translation methodology used for a particular
country or countries. In addition, Buyer will notify Seller prior to changing
or implementing its exchange rate translation methodology.

 

(c) If, by reason of applicable Law in any country, it becomes impossible
or illegal to pay any Milestone Payment or Royalty due hereunder in U.S.
Dollars, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and (i) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, such payments shall be deposited in local currency in the
relevant country to the credit of Seller in a recognized banking institution
designated by Seller or, if none is designated by Seller within thirty (30)
days of such notice from Buyer, in a recognized banking institution selected
by Buyer and identified in a written notice provided to Seller, and (ii) to
the extent not permitted under applicable Law, such payments shall be
negotiated promptly and in good faith by the Parties.

 

(d) Buyer shall pay interest on any amount due that is not paid on or
before the date such payments are due under this Agreement, after the
expiration of [***] day grace period, at an annual rate equal to [***] as

effect on the date such payment was required to be made, calculated on the
total number of days payment is delinquent.

preliminary allocation of the consideration (including any liabilities assumed
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) among the Purchased Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder
(and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate) on
the Closing Date, which preliminary allocation may be updated by Seller within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall review the
preliminary allocation and any updates made by Seller and provide any
reasonable objections or comments within fifteen (15) days after the receipt
thereof, which Seller shall reasonably consider. The preliminary allocation,
reflecting Buyers reasonable comments and any updates made by Seller, shall
become final thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt thereof (the "Allocation
Schedule"). Any subsequent adjustments to the consideration for the Purchased
Assets shall be reflected in amendments to the Allocation Schedule as
determined by Seller, and subject to Buyers reasonable comments, in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as
appropriate). Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall report and
file Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. Neither Seller
nor Buyer shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation Schedule unless required
to do so by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.14 _Diligence Obligations_. At all times during the Contingent
Payment Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause any Buyer Related Party to,
comply with all applicable Laws with respect to developing, commercializing

the first such Update Report due in January of 2019 and subsequent Update
Reports due in January of each applicable year. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of each Update Report, if Seller requests a meeting with
representatives of Buyer to discuss such report, Buyer shall make available
for such a meeting, upon reasonable notice during regular business hours,
those of its and the other Buyer Related Parties employees and
representatives that are responsible for the applicable activities set forth
in the Update Report.

 

Section 2.16 _Patent Prosecution_. Buyer shall file, prosecute and
maintain the Purchased Patent Rights, based on reasonable commercial and
patent prosecution strategy considerations, in accordance with commercially
reasonable practices for biopharmaceutical companies of a comparable size to
obtain intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products
comparable to the Contingent Payment Products (but without taking into account
the particular circumstances of Buyer, including any other product
opportunities of Buyer and amounts payable to Seller hereunder).

 _COVENANTS_

 

Section 5.1 _Retained Names_.

 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges that, as between the Parties and each of
their respective Affiliates, all right, title and interest in and to the
Retained Names (including the GSI Retained Name) are owned exclusively by
Seller and/or its respective Affiliates. Buyer further acknowledges that,
except as expressly set forth in Section 5.1(b), it has no rights, and is not
acquiring any rights, to use the Retained Names. In no event shall Buyer or
any of its Affiliates hold themselves out as having any affiliation with
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Upon and following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cease using any and all Retained Names, except that, during
the period [***] immediately following Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be permitted to use the GSI Retained Name in the manner that the GSI Retained
Name was used by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to Closing
solely in connection with the use of any inventory of Products in the Ongoing
Clinical Trials; _provided_ _that_ , such inventory is included in the
Purchased Assets described in Section 2.3(c) and the existing
packaging depicts the GSI Retained Name. As of the Closing or, with respect
to the GSI Retained Name, following expiration of the period of permitted use
as described in the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all
Retained Names from all Purchased Assets, including any packaging materials
and other inventory in respect of the Product, and other materials transferred
hereunder, except in the case of debossed pills of Product (which, for
clarity, Buyer shall be required to destroy). Any use by Buyer of the GSI
Retained Name as permitted in this Section 5.1(b) is subject to the following
conditions: (i) use of the GSI Retained Name shall be in a form and manner,
and with standards of quality, of that in effect for the GSI Retained Name as
of the Closing, (ii) the GSI Retained Name shall not be used in a manner that
may reflect negatively on such name and marks or on Seller or its Affiliates,

the Trademarks forming a part of or associated with the Retained Names and
(iv) Buyer and its Affiliates shall, in connection with all written uses of
the GSI Retained Name (including on any packaging materials and other
inventory), include a clear statement that the associated products or services
are manufactured by or otherwise emanate from Buyer and its Affiliates and not
from Seller and its Affiliates. Seller shall have the right to terminate the
foregoing, effective immediately, if Buyer and its Affiliates

*** Confidential Treatment Requested.

    

 fail to comply with the foregoing terms and conditions or otherwise fail to
comply with any reasonable direction of Seller in relation to the use of the
Retained Names. Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and any of its Affiliates for any Losses arising from or relating to
the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Retained Names pursuant to
this Section 5.1(b). Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
remedy at Law for any breach of the requirements of this Section 5.1(b) would
be inadequate and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may be available, Seller and its Affiliates shall be
entitled to a temporary or permanent injunction, without proof of actual
damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, and without posting any bond or other
undertaking, in any Action which may be brought to enforce any of the
provisions of this Section 5.1(b).

Section 5.2 _Non-Assignable  Assets; Further Assurances_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery or attempted conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery to Buyer of any of the Purchased Assets (i)
is prohibited by any applicable Law or (ii) would require any authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers from another Person to convey, assign,
transfer or deliver such asset, and such authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers have not been obtained prior to the Closing (each, a "Non-
Assignable Asset"), in either case, the Closing shall proceed, but the Closing
shall not constitute the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of
such Non-Assignable Asset, and this Agreement shall not constitute a
conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of such Non-Assignable Asset
unless and until such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained.
After the Closing, the Parties shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts and cooperate with each other, without additional consideration, to
obtain any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver as promptly as
practicable, it being understood that (i) Seller shall not be required to pay
any consideration to any other Person (unless Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
for such amounts), offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise)
to obtain any authorization, approval consent or waiver of such other Person
and (ii) to the extent the foregoing shall require any action that would, or
would continue to negatively affect Buyer following the Closing, such action
shall require the consent of Buyer. Once authorization, approval or waiver of
or consent for the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such
Non-Assignable Asset is obtained, Seller shall convey, assign, transfer and
deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to Buyer at no additional cost to Buyer but
subject to the immediately foregoing sentence. Pending such transfer, Seller
shall (i) cooperate with Buyer or its designees in any commercially
reasonable arrangement designed to provide Buyer or its designee with all of
the rights and benefits of the Non-Assignable Assets after the Closing as if
Buyer owned such Non-Assignable Assets. The Parties agree that upon the
Closing, Buyer shall be treated as the owner of any Non-Assignable Asset for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

(b) With respect to any Governmental Authorization that is a Non-Assignable
Asset (a "Non-Assignable Authorization"), notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, Sellers liabilities and obligations with respect thereto
shall cease in all respects as of the date that is two (2) years after the
Closing. On and after such date, Seller shall have no ongoing liabilities or
obligations to Buyer whatsoever in relation to such Non-Assignable
Authorizations or the Products approved, cleared, marketed or sold under such
Non-Assignable Authorizations, including any obligation to assist in the
transfer of any such Non-Assignable Authorizations. On and after such date,
Seller shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to cease, or
cause to cease, the maintenance of such Non-Assignable Authorizations in the
applicable issuing countries or territories, and to terminate the same.

(c) After the Closing Date each of the Parties will execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered (without any additional consideration),
(i) such assignments, deeds, bills of sale and other instruments of transfer
as either Party reasonably may request as necessary or desirable in order to
effect or further evidence the sale and assignment of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer and the retention of the Excluded Assets by Seller, and (ii) such
assumption agreements and other instruments of assumption as either Party
reasonably may request as necessary or desirable in order to effect or
further evidence the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, or to obtain
releases of Seller or Buyer and their respective Affiliates, as applicable
from any Liability with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or Excluded
Liabilities, as applicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and
filing all instruments and documents necessary to effect the assignment of the
Purchased IP to Buyer (other than the Patent Assignment Agreement to be
delivered pursuant to Section 2.2) and all costs and expenses with respect
thereto, including preparing and recording country-specific assignments and
legalization of signatures (where required), and following Buyers reasonable
request, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer (and Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs), with respect to the
foregoing for a period of [***] following the Closing.

Section 5.3 _Press Releases_ _; Disclosure_. Neither Buyer nor Seller
shall, and Buyer and Seller shall cause of each of their respective
Affiliates not to, issue a press release, trade announcement or any other
public announcement with regard to the transactions contemplated hereby
without the other Partys prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. This restriction shall not apply to (i) the Buyers press
release announcing the transaction in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
and (ii) __ announcements required by applicable Law or any Governmental
Authority, however, in connection with subsection (ii) hereto, the Parties
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, coordinate and work in good faith
to create mutually acceptable announcements. To the extent any Party is
required to file a copy of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as an
exhibit to any filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or any Governmental Authority, the Parties agree to request
confidential treatment for the commercially sensitive portions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be so filed with the SEC or any
Governmental Authority. Further, to the extent any Party is required to file a
copy of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as an exhibit to any
filings with the SEC or any Governmental Authority, then such Party shall
prepare a draft of such filing for the other Partys review and comment,
including a proposed redacted version of this Agreement to be filed as an
exhibit to such draft, if such filing includes disclosure of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement and its terms. Such draft filing and proposed redacted
version of this Agreement shall be provided to the other Party reasonably in
advance of the deadline for such filing, and the other Party shall promptly
(and in any event, no fewer than five (5) days or such shorter time to meet
any filing deadline where it was not practical to provide the other Party
with such notice) provide its input in a reasonable manner in order to allow
the Party seeking disclosure to file within the timelines proscribed by

 



27

 

*** Confidential Treatment Requested.

    

 the regulations of the SEC or applicable Governmental Authority, which input
the Party seeking such disclosure will reasonably consider. The Party seeking
such disclosure will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
confidential treatment for the commercially sensitive portions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement from the SEC or applicable Governmental
Authority as represented by the redacted version reviewed by the other Party.
If a Current Report on Form 8-K is to be filed by Buyer with respect to this
Agreement, then Buyer shall not file a copy of this Agreement in or as in
exhibit to such Form 8-K.

Section 5.4 Maintenance of Books and Records; Sellers Access. For a
period of [***] after the Closing Date, or until the [***], (i) Buyer agrees
to retain (and to cause its Affiliates to retain) and make available all data
and books and records received from Seller and its Affiliates for inspection
and copying by Seller or its agents at Sellers expense, upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable notice; _provided_ _that_ such data and books and
records shall be made available only to the extent such availability is
required for Seller or one or more of its Affiliates to comply with a
requirement of Law, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or to enable
Seller or one or more of its Affiliates to defend against, respond to, or
otherwise participate in any litigation, investigation, audit process,
subpoena or other proceeding related to the Product, and (ii) no such data and
other books and records shall be destroyed by Buyer without giving thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Seller to permit Seller, at Sellers sole cost,
to duplicate or take possession of any such data, books and records. Any such
access by Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of Buyer and its Affiliates. Seller will hold, and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of applicable Law, all confidential documents and
information concerning Buyer provided to it pursuant to this Section 5.4.

 

Section 5.5 _Transfer of Product INDs_. Buyer and Seller shall, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within [***] days after the Closing
Date, each notify the FDA in writing of the transfer of ownership and all
rights to the Product INDs to Buyer in accordance with all applicable Laws.
Buyer concurrently shall notify the FDA in writing of the change of ownership
to the Product. Product INDs in any jurisdiction outside the United States
shall be closed or transferred to Buyer on a country-by-country basis
as specified in the transition plan.

Section 5.6 _Assumption of Regulatory Commitments_. From and after
the Closing Date and in accordance with the transition plan, Buyer will
assume control of, and responsibility for all costs, obligations and
Liabilities arising from or related to any commitments or obligations to any
Governmental Authority involving the Product, but only to the extent such
Liabilities (i) arise from facts and circumstances occurring after the Closing
Date and (ii) do not arise from or relate to any breach by Seller of its
obligations or any of its Affiliates obligations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for
certain regulatory commitments in accordance with the transition plan until
such regulatory commitments become the responsibility of Buyer or, if
earlier, are fulfilled.

Section 5.7 _Clinical Trials; Clinical Trial Agreements_. 

(a) Seller has begun the process of winding-down the Ongoing Clinical
Trials, including [***], in accordance with accepted pharmaceutical industry
norms and ethical practices. Buyer shall assume responsibility to conduct and
complete the Ongoing Clinical Trials, including the responsibilities specified
in the transition plan, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date (and in no event later than [***] or as extended to such other date as
mutually agreed upon by the Parties, according to the transition plan). After
the Closing Date and in accordance with the transition plan, Seller
and/or its applicable Affiliates shall be responsible for maintaining certain
activities related to the Ongoing Clinical Trials, which are specified in the
transition plan, until such activities become the responsibility of Buyer in
accordance with the transition plan or, if earlier, are completed. From and
after the Closing, Buyer hereby grants Seller rights and access to all
applicable Purchased Assets to the extent needed to satisfy Sellers
obligations specified in the transition plan or otherwise herein with respect
to the Ongoing Clinical Trials. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith
and to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the obligations
specified in the transition plan and any other agreement referred to in the
transition plan. 

(b) In connection with the Ongoing Clinical Trials, Seller has entered
into clinical trial-related agreements (the "Clinical Trial Agreements") with
Third Parties with respect to the performance of the Ongoing Clinical Trials.
Seller will cause to be transferred to Buyer any and all Clinical Trial
Agreements as identified in the transition plan. To effect any such transfer,
Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller, and Seller will cause to be executed
and delivered to Buyer, an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit D. In the event that Seller is unable to assign a
Clinical Trial Agreement to Buyer after the Closing, Buyer may enter into a
separate agreement in place of the unassignable Clinical Trial Agreement. In
addition, after the Closing, Seller will terminate any or all such Clinical
Trial Agreements as Buyer may so request, if possible and if permitted by
Sellers ethical practices. If any Clinical Trial Agreement is not earlier
terminated by Seller at Buyers request nor transferred to Buyer or a Party
promptly designated by Buyer by or before the end of the transition plan,
Seller will, if possible and if permitted by Sellers ethical practices,
terminate such Clinical Trial Agreements unless continuing good faith efforts
are being made to transfer the Clinical Trial Agreement to Buyer. Buyer shall
remain free to enter into its own agreements in place of those so terminated.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.7(e) below or Section 5.5, Section
5.6, 5.7(a) or 5.7(b) above, Buyer will have the right to control all aspects
of the Ongoing Clinical Trials. Therefore, Seller will exercise such rights as
it may have, and will cause any of its Affiliates, as appropriate, to do so
under the Clinical Trial Agreements, as directed by Buyer, including by
requesting the other party or parties to such Clinical Trial Agreements to
take such actions, or to not take such actions, as are permitted or required
under such Clinical Trial Agreements and under applicable Laws and regulatory
requirements, all as Buyer may so direct. However, Seller shall not have any
duty to take such actions or fail to take such action unless such actions or
failure to take such actions are consistent with Sellers ethical practices.

(d) Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than [***] days after
receipt of the request for reimbursement) reimburse Buyer for any amounts
actually paid or accrued by Buyer to any other party or parties related to
[***]; _provided_ _that_ Seller shall only be obligated to reimburse
Buyer (i) for amounts actually paid or accrued by Buyer for [***] or (ii) for
other amounts actually paid or accrued related to [***]. Buyer shall submit an
invoice and reasonable supporting documentation for such reimbursable amounts
to Seller no later than [***], and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all such
undisputed amounts within [***] days of receipt of such invoice.

 

(e) The Parties hereby designate __ [***] and [***] to serve as the initial
main point of contact for each Party to coordinate the Parties activities
with respect to the transition from Seller to Buyer of the Ongoing Clinical
Trials under this Agreement (such initial contacts, as may be replaced by the
Parties from time to time, the "Designated Contacts"). The Parties intend
that the Designated Contacts meet and/or correspond on a monthly basis for
such purposes and as otherwise needed, including to manage the post-Closing
undertakings contemplated hereby. Each Party may change its Designated
Contact from time to time upon written notice to the other Party; _provided_
_that_ the Parties recognize and agree as to the importance of continuity in
their relationship and the activities hereunder.

 

Section 5.8 _Adverse Events_. From and after the Closing, Buyer will

Section 6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_ _._

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement arising out of or resulting from any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding made or brought by a Third Party (a
"Third Party Claim") against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance
with the following procedures.

 

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable (an "Indemnified Party"), shall give prompt written notification
to the Person from whom indemnification is sought under this Article VI (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the commencement of any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the receipt of any such
claim or demand by a Third Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure so
to notify the Indemnifying Party promptly or at all shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation it may have to the
Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice caused by
such failure. Such notification shall include a description in reasonable
detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) of the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the Losses
claimed. Within twenty-five (25) days after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _that_ if the
Indemnifying Party is Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (i) seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief or involves a criminal act alleged
against the Indemnified Party, (ii) relates to the Purchased IP or (iii) is
brought by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority.

(ii) The Party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its
own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based
on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
have conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall also be considered "Losses" for the purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense
shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and
the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other Party
with respect thereto.

 



31

    

(iii) The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of any Third Party Claim
that does not include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability with respect thereto or that admits to any liability
on the part of, or imposes any liability, injunction or obligation on, the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(other than the payment of money as to which the Indemnifying Party has
acknowledged in writing its indemnification obligation hereunder and has
provided the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party of its ability to pay) which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this Article VI which is not subject to
Section 6.3(a) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a
"Claim Notice"), based upon the information then available to the Indemnified
Party, which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed Amount")
of any Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VI and a
reasonable explanation of the basis therefor and (iii) a demand for payment
in the amount of such Losses. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (A) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which
case such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire
transfer), (B) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part,
but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case such
response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or (C)
contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount. If the Indemnifying Party in such response contests the payment of
all or part of the Claimed Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute.

 

Section 6.4 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer set forth in
Article III and Article IV of this Agreement, or in any Ancillary Agreement,
shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue until the date that is [***] months after the
Closing Date, at which time they shall (except as set forth in Section
6.4(b)) expire. All covenants, agreements and undertakings of the Parties
contemplating performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing
Date in accordance with their terms, subject to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for any claim relating thereto.

(b) No claim for indemnification may be made based on a representation or
warranty after the expiration thereof as provided in Section 6.4(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if an indemnification claim under Section 6.1(i)
or Section 6.2(i) is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section 6.3
prior to the expiration as provided in Section 6.4(a) of the representation or
warranty that is the basis for such claim, then such representation or
warranty shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of
such claim.

Section 6.5 _Limitations_ _._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the following limitations shall apply to indemnification claims under this
Agreement:



     | (i) |

Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall be liable with
respect to claims under Section 6.1(i) or Section 6.2(i), respectively, only
if the aggregate Losses related to such claims, when considered together,
exceeds [***] (the "Threshold") in which case Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
shall be liable for the amount of all Losses (including amounts up to the
Threshold), subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of Seller for Losses
paid with respect to the indemnification described in Section 6.1(i) shall
not exceed [***] (the "Seller Indemnification Cap"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller Indemnification Cap shall not apply with respect to any Losses
arising from fraud. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of Buyer for Losses
paid with respect to the indemnification described in this Section 6.2(i)
shall not exceed [***] (the "Buyer Indemnification Cap"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Indemnification Cap shall not apply with respect to
any Losses arising from fraud. 

---|---|--- 

(b) The amount of Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
Article VI with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount
of any payment received by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof),
with respect to the Losses to which such indemnity claim relates, from an
insurance carrier. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in pursuing
insurance claims with respect to any Losses or any indemnification obligations
with respect to Losses. If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof)
receives any insurance payment in connection with any claim for Losses for
which it has already received an indemnification payment from the Indemnifying
Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days of
receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess of (A) the
amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under this Article VI with
respect to such claim plus the amount of the insurance payments received, over
(B) the amount of Losses with respect to such claim which the
Indemnified Party was or has become entitled to receive under this Article VI
and the costs associated with obtaining such insurance payment, including the
cost of any increased premiums.

 

(c) Except for claims for equitable relief (including specific performance)
made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the rights of the Indemnified Parties
under this Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims
covered by Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 or otherwise arising out of, resulting
from or relating to this Agreement (including any exhibits or schedules
hereto), any Ancillary Agreement (including any exhibits or
schedules thereto) or any certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

*** Confidential Treatment Requested.

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
in the event that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, Buyer shall have the right, but
shall not be obligated to, set off, against any Milestone Payment or Royalties
to Seller pursuant to Section 2.9 or Section 2.10, respectively, any amounts
to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Article VI,
applying such amounts in satisfaction, to the extent of such amount, of such
owed amounts; _provided_ _that_ any set off pursuant to this Section 6.5(d)
shall only be permitted in respect of an amount finally determined to be owed
by the Indemnifying Party to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to a final
non-appealable order or judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, all indemnification payments made under this
Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Closing
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, proper adjustments shall be made to
the Allocation Schedule with respect to any indemnification payments pursuant
to this Article VI.

 and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any
claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, that
such Action is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such
Action is improper. Each of the Parties also hereby agrees that any final and
unappealable judgment against a Party in connection with any such Action shall
be conclusive and binding on such Party and that such award or judgment may
be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside
of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such judgment shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment. Each
Party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for the giving of notices pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 7.10 shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

Section 7.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the fullest extent permitted by
Law, each of the Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
Action or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.12 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns_. No Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other Party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that following the Closing, either Party may assign (a) any of its
rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates for so long as such
Affiliates remain Affiliates of such Party, (b) all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to its successor in interest in connection with the
transfer or sale of all or substantially all of its stock or assets, or in
connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control or similar
transaction and (c) in the case of Seller, its right to receive payments
hereunder, including Milestone Payments and Royalties, and all related rights
and obligations to any Affiliate or Third Party, in each case, without the
consent of the other Party. Any attempted assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be null and void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the Parties
hereto, but any such assignment by any Party hereto shall not relieve such
assigning Party of any of its obligations or agreements hereunder unless
expressly agreed to in writing by each other Party hereto in its sole
discretion.

Section 7.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner. 

Section 7.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
