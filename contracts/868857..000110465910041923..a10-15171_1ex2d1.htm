Section 2.6 Net Working Capital Adjustment.

  



  

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted after the Closing by adding
thereto the Net Working Capital Excess, if any, or deducting therefrom the
Net Working Capital Shortfall, if any. As used herein, the following terms
shall have the definitions set forth below:

  



  

(i) The term " **Net Working Capital Shortfall** " means the amount, if any,
by which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.6(c) below, is less than the Target Net Working Capital.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) The term " **Net Working Capital Excess** " means the amount, if any, by
which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.6(c) below, is more than the Target Net Working Capital.

  



  

(iii) The term " **Net Working Capital** " means, as of the date and time of
determination, the positive or negative difference between (i) the sum
(without duplication) of the current assets of the Acquired Companies, on a
consolidated basis, as of such date and time, using only the categories of
current assets specified in Schedule 2.6 to be included in the calculation
referred to in this clause (i) and otherwise calculated consistent with the
manner in which the Closing Balance Sheet is required to be prepared pursuant
to Section 2.6(b), _and_ (ii) the sum (without duplication) of the current
liabilities of the Acquired Companies, on a consolidated basis, as of such
date and time, using only the categories of current liabilities specified in
Schedule 2.6 to be included in the calculation referred to in this clause
(ii) and otherwise calculated consistent with the manner in which the Closing
Balance Sheet is required to be prepared pursuant to Section 2.6(b).

  



  

(iv) The term " **Closing Net Working Capital** " means Net Working Capital
as of the close of business, Eastern Time, on the Closing Date.

  



  

(v) The term " **Target Net Working Capital** " means Thirty Five Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($35,200,000).

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event
later than 60 days following the Closing Date), Sellers shall prepare
and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Buyer the following:
(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close
of business, Eastern Time, on the Closing Date (the " **Closing Balance
Sheet** ") and (ii) an unaudited statement that sets forth a calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (the "
**Closing Net Working Capital Statement** "), in each case determined (x)
after giving effect to any payment of Closing Indebtedness (including at
the Closing), (y) without giving effect to any event or occurring after
the Closing involving Buyer or the financing transactions (if any) in
connection therewith and (z) without reflecting any impact of purchase
accounting. Until the Closing Net Working Capital amount becomes final and
binding, Buyer shall provide Sellers and their Representatives access to the
books and records and employees of the Acquired Companies to the extent
necessary or desirable for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or
the resolution of any dispute with respect thereto and shall cause the
employees of the Acquired Companies to cooperate with Sellers and their
Representatives in connection with the preparation by Sellers or their
Representatives of the Closing Balance Sheet or the resolution of any dispute
with respect thereto, provided that such access shall be provided during
normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice by Sellers or their
Representatives to Buyer and such access shall be arranged and provided in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the ongoing
business of the Acquired Companies. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared on a consolidated basis for the Acquired Companies in accordance
with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the accounting practices,
policies, judgments and methodologies used in the preparation of the Current
Balance Sheet and as further described on Schedule 2.6. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, the

  



         
 

  



  

Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and the Closing Net Working Capital
shall be calculated, in accordance with, and to the extent set forth in, the
Addendum to Schedule 2.6.

  



  

(c) The Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital (as set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement) shall
become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (i) the date
Buyer notifies Sellers in writing of its acceptance of the Closing Balance
Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement) or (ii) the forty-fifth (45th)
calendar day following Buyers receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Net Working Capital Statement, unless Buyer notifies Sellers in
writing prior to such date of its disagreement with any aspect of the Closing
Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital (as set
forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement) (a " **Notice
of Disagreement** "). The Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any such disagreement, including Buyers own
determination of the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital.  If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Sellers within
forty-five (45) days after Buyers receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, then (x) the Closing Net Working
Capital amount (as described in clause (y) below) shall become final and
binding only upon the earlier of (A) the date that Sellers and Buyer resolve
in writing any differences that they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, or (B) the date any disputed matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement (to the extent not previously
resolved by Sellers and Buyer in writing) are finally resolved through
accounting arbitration in accordance with Section 2.6(d), and (y) the final
and binding Closing Net Working Capital amount shall be deemed to be the
amount agreed to by Sellers and Buyer in writing, or as resolved through
accounting arbitration in accordance with Section 2.6(d), as the case may be;
provided  that in no event shall the final and binding Closing Net Working
Capital amount be more favorable to Sellers than the amount of Closing Net
Working Capital reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
prepared by Sellers nor more favorable to Buyer than the amount of Closing
Net Working Capital reflected in the Notice of Disagreement delivered by
Buyer.

  



  

(d) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly and timely delivered
pursuant to Section 2.6(c), Sellers and Buyer shall, during the thirty (30)
days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith the resolution of
the disagreements specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the
conclusion of such 30-day period, Sellers and Buyer have not resolved any
such disagreements, then all amounts and issues specified in the Notice of
Disagreement remaining in dispute shall be submitted by Sellers and Buyer for
definitive resolution to an independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing mutually selected by Sellers and Buyer (in either case, the
" **Independent Firm** "), provided that if Sellers and Buyer are unable to
agree on such other accounting firm within five (5) Business Days, Sellers
and Buyer shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing to serve as the Independent Firm by lot, based on the list of firms
set forth on Schedule 2.6(d). The Independent Firm shall be engaged by
Sellers and Buyer no later than ten (10) Business Days following the later to
occur of (i) the conclusion of such 30-day period and (ii) the determination
of the identity of the Independent Firm in accordance with this Section
2.6(d). Each of Sellers and Buyer agrees to promptly execute, if requested by
the Independent Firm, a reasonable engagement letter with respect to the
determination to be made by the Independent Firm with respect to such dispute
in accordance with this Section 2.6(d). The Independent Firm shall determine
only those issues

  



        
   

  



  

specified in the Notice of Disagreement duly and timed delivered pursuant to
Section 2.6(c) and still in dispute at the end of the 30-day period following
the delivery thereof, and the Independent Firms determination shall be based
upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and with
the undisputed portions of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement. The determination by the Independent Firm shall be
based on presentations with respect to such disputed items by Sellers and
Buyer to the Independent Firm and not on the Independent Firms
independent review. Sellers and Buyer will provide copies to one another of
all written submissions to the Independent Firm and shall be permitted to
attend (and shall receive reasonable advance written notice of) any meeting
with or presentations to the Independent Firm. Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall use their Best Efforts to make their
respective presentations as promptly as practicable following submission to
the Independent Firm of the disputed items (but in no event later than
fifteen days after engagement of the Independent Firm), and each of Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall be entitled, as part of
its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other presenter and
any questions and requests of the Independent Firm. Sellers
presentations to the Independent Firm shall be consistent with Sellers
earlier positions set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working
Capital Statement, and Buyers presentations to the Independent Firm shall be
consistent with Buyers earlier positions set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement. In deciding any matter, the Independent Firm (i) shall be bound
by the provisions of this Section 2.6 and (ii) may not assign a value to any
item (x) greater than the greatest value for such item claimed (1) by Sellers
in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
(or in Sellers presentations to the Independent Firm) or (2) by Buyer in the
Notice of Disagreement (or in Buyers presentations to the Independent Firm)
or (y) less than the smallest value for such item claimed (1) by Sellers in
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement (or
Sellers presentations to the Independent Firm) or (2) by Buyer in the Notice
of Disagreement (or in Buyers presentations to the Independent Firm).  The
Independent Firms determination shall be made within 45 days after its
engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, shall be set forth in
a written statement delivered to Sellers and Buyer and shall be
final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder,
absent manifest error by the Independent Firm.  The determination of the
Independent Firm shall not be deemed an award subject to review under the
Federal Arbitration Act or any other similar statute. All fees and expenses
of the Independent Firm pursuant to its engagement by Sellers and Buyer to
make its determination with respect to such dispute shall be borne (i) by
Sellers if the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital (as
determined by the Independent Firm) and Sellers calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement is
greater than the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital (as
determined by the Independent Firm) and Buyers calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) by Buyer if
the first such difference is less than the second such difference, and (iii)
otherwise equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

  



  

(e) Until the Closing Net Working Capital amount becomes final and
binding, each Party shall make available to the other Party its (and shall
use its Best Efforts to cause its Representatives) work papers, schedules
and other supporting data (to the extent within the possession or control of
such Party) as may reasonably be requested by such Party to enable such Party
to verify the calculations of Closing Net Working Capital as set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet or the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may be,
subject to the execution by the

  



        
   

  



  

other Party of (i) customary confidentiality agreements and indemnity
agreements and (ii) to the extent any work papers, schedules or other
supporting data of any independent accountants are so requested, indemnity
agreements in favor of such accountants as may be required by such
accountants in their sole discretion.

  



  

(f) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Net Working
Capital amount becomes final and binding, (i) if a Net Working Capital
Shortfall exists, the amount of the Net Working Capital Shortfall, together
with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest most
recently published by the _Wall Street Journal_  as the "prime rate" at
large U.S. money center banks (the **"Prime Rate"** ) on the Closing
Date (calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the Closing
Date to the date of payment), shall be paid to Buyer by Sellers, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Buyer, by written notice to Sellers, no later than ten (10) Business Days
following Sellers receipt of such written notice from Buyer or (ii) if a Net
Working Capital Excess exists, Buyer shall pay, or cause the Acquired
Companies to pay, the Net Working Capital Excess, together with interest
thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate on the Closing Date
(calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date
to the date of payment), to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by Sellers, by written notice to
Buyer, no later than ten (10) Business Days following Buyers receipt of such
written notice from Sellers.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
in addition to the payment of the Closing Purchase Price referred to in
Section 2.2 and the adjustments to the Purchase Price referred to in Section
2.6 above, Buyer hereby agrees that on or immediately after the Closing,
Buyer shall pay, or cause the Acquired Companies to pay, to Sellers the
amount of any cash and cash equivalents held by the Acquired Companies as of
the Closing Date by means of a wire transfer of immediately available to one
or more accounts designated by Sellers, by written notice to Buyer, which
notice shall be delivered at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

  



  

(h) Buyers and Sellers rights to indemnification pursuant to Article IX
hereof (and any limitations on such rights) shall not be deemed to limit,
supersede or otherwise affect Buyers or Sellers rights to a full Purchase
Price adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.6; _provided, however_ , that to
the extent a Party receives a Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to this
Section 2.6, such Party shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect
to the matter that resulted in such adjustment.

  



  

Section 2.7 Escrow Arrangements.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Funds shall be held, invested and distributed in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and in accordance with this
Article II and Article IX hereof.

  



  

(b) On the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, or if such
date is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter (such Business
Day, the **"First Scheduled Release Date"** ), Sellers and Buyer shall cause
the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent) to release, or disburse, in accordance

  



        
   

  



  

with Section 2.7(d), from the Escrow Funds, an amount (not less than zero)
equal to (I) the amount of the Escrow Funds as of the First Scheduled Release
Date in excess of the sum of (A) $17,750,000, plus (B) one-half of the Net
Escrow Income as of the Scheduled Release Date, _minus_ (II) the sum
(without duplication) of all Unsatisfied Escrow Claims as of the First
Scheduled Release Date (such aggregate amount, the **"First Delayed Release
Amount"** ). If, after the First Scheduled Release Date, all or any portion
of the First Delayed Release Amount is Finally Determined not to be owed to
the Buyer Indemnitees on behalf of which, or for whose account, the related
Unsatisfied Escrow Claims have been made pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers
and Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days after such Final
Determination, cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) to release to, or disburse, in accordance
with Section 2.7(d), from the Escrow Funds, such amount, but only to the
extent not in excess of (I) the sum of the amount of the Escrow
Funds determined as of the date of such release or disbursement in excess of
the sum of (A) $17,750,000 plus (B) one-half of the Net Escrow Income as of
the date of such release or disbursement, _minus_ (II) the sum (without
duplication) of all Unsatisfied Escrow Claims as of the date of such release
or disbursement.

  



  

(c) On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, or if
such date is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter (such
Business Day, the **"Second Scheduled Release Date"** ), Sellers and Buyer
shall cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) to release, or disburse, in accordance with
Section 2.7(d), from the Escrow Funds, an amount (not less than zero) equal
to (I) the amount of the Escrow Funds as of the Second Scheduled Release
Date, _minus_ (II) the sum (without duplication) of all Unsatisfied Escrow
Claims as of the Second Scheduled Release Date (such aggregate amount, the
**"Second Delayed Release Amount"** ). If, after the Second Scheduled
Release Date, all or any portion of the Second Delayed Release Amount is
Finally Determined not to be owed to the Buyer Indemnitees on behalf of
which, or for whose account, the related Unsatisfied Escrow Claims have been
made pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer shall, within five (5)
Business Days after such Final Determination, cause the Escrow Agent
(including by delivering joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent) to
release to, or disburse, in accordance with Section 2.7(d), from the Escrow
Funds, such amount, but only to the extent that the Escrow Funds, determined
as of the date of such release or disbursement (immediately after giving
effect to such release or disbursement), will be at least equal to the sum
(without duplication) of all Unsatisfied Escrow Claims as of the date of such
release or disbursement (immediately after giving effect to such release or
disbursement).

  



  

(d) Subject to Article IX hereof, any amounts distributed in accordance
with Section 2.7(b) or 2.7(c) shall be paid by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account pursuant to the written payment
instructions of Sellers delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.8 GLS-Related Payments.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause the
Acquired Companies to pay, to Sellers the amount of the Pre-Closing McNeil
Portion of each GLS Distributable Amount distributed by GLS to the Acquired
Companies (if any), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated in writing by Sellers to Buyer,

  



        
   

  



  

no later than two Business Days following the last to occur of (x) the making
of such distribution by GLS and (y) Buyers receipt of Sellers written
designation of such accounts.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall (i) keep Sellers informed,
in reasonable detail, on a current basis, of any discussions between the
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) (and their
respective Representatives), on the one hand, and DI, GLS, and their
respective Affiliates (and their respective Representatives), on the other
hand, regarding the calculation of the GLS Distributable Amount, and (ii)
immediately following the determination of each GLS Distributable Amount (if
any), deliver to Sellers a written notice specifying (A) the GLS
Distributable Amount (as so finally determined), (B) the date on which the
distribution of such GLS Distributable Amount is to be made by GLS, and (C)
the Pre-Closing McNeil Portion of such GLS Distributable Amount, accompanied
by reasonable supporting documentation for the calculation of such GLS
Distributable Amount and such Pre-Closing McNeil Portion thereof (including
any accruals for award fees to GLS under the GLS Customer Contract included
therein).

  



  

(c) Buyer covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies (and its and their respective Representatives) to not,
take any affirmative action, or fail to take any reasonable action within its
or their control, the results of which would reasonably be expected to
interfere in any material respect in maximizing the aggregate amount of the
payments to be made to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.8(a) above, including,
but not limited to, amending or supplementing the GLS Operating Agreement so
as to alter the calculation, distribution or sharing of any GLS Distributable
Amount, failing to diligently pursue the calculation and distribution of any
GLS Distributable Amount, or failing to calculate any GLS Distributable
Amount in accordance with pre-Closing past practice of the Acquired Companies
(to the extent such practice is consistent with the applicable requirements
of the GLS Operating Agreement).

  



  

(d) Payment pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be net of any reasonable
costs incurred by Buyer and the Company to enforce the Companys rights to
receive payment from GLS of any amounts which Buyer is required to cause to
be paid to Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.8.  For the avoidance of
doubt, any amounts which are paid by Buyer or the Acquired Companies to
Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.8 (before giving effect to the netting
referred to in the prior sentence of this Section 2.8(d)) shall be deemed to
have occurred in the portion of a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

  



  

Section 2.9 Stock Awards. Effective at the Closing, Buyer will cause to be
established a pool for awards of Parent common stock with a value of
$5,000,000 at such date.  Such stock awards will be issued to members of
senior management of the Acquired Companies, based on recommendations by the
CEO and COO of the Company and with the consent of Parent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

Section 2.10 Retention Bonuses. Buyer shall cause MTI to pay, following the
Closing, all Retention Bonuses in accordance with the applicable terms and
conditions of the Retention Agreements. In the event that, after the
Closing, any Retention Participant forfeits his or her right to receive a
Retention Bonus (or any portion thereof) under the terms of the Retention
Agreement to which he or she is a party, (i) Buyer shall, within five (5)
Business Days of such

  



        
   

  



  

forfeiture, notify Sellers thereof in writing, specifying in such notice the
applicable Retention Participant and the amount so forfeited, and (ii) Buyer
shall pay, or cause MTI to pay, such forfeited amount to Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Sellers, no later than five (5) Business Days following Buyers receipt of
Sellers wire transfer instructions.

being conducted. Each of Sellers, the Acquired Companies and Veritas is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions in which applicable Law does not
provide for such qualification, licensing or being in good standing
and except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified
or licensed and in good standing would not in the aggregate be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. Sellers have

Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Companies, GLS and the Other

each Seller of the Transaction Documents to which it is specified to be a

the part of such Seller are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by such Seller of any Transaction Document to which it is specified to be a

Seller and by Veritas.  Assuming the due and valid authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Buyer, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Sellers and
Veritas, enforceable against such Person in accordance with its terms, except

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. Assuming the due

thereto, each other Transaction Document to which a Seller is specified to be
a party (when executed and delivered by such Seller) shall constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller, enforceable against such
Seller in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights

Acquired Companies; (ii) except with respect to consents required under the
Contracts set forth on Schedule 3.3(a), result in a breach of, or constitute

there is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened
against or arising out of an Employee Benefit Plan, except for those
Proceedings which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material effect on the Acquired Companies. Each Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan"
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS. None of the Acquired Companies contributes to, or has
any obligation to contribute to, or has any material liability with respect
to, any Title IV Plan or any Multiemployer Plan.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17, there is no contract, plan or
arrangement covering any employee or former employee of any Acquired Company
that, individually or collectively, as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, would reasonably be expected to give rise to the payment of
benefits which would not be deductible by the applicable Acquired Company by
reason of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

Section 3.18 Labor Matters.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.18, no Acquired Company is a party to
or otherwise bound by or currently negotiating in connection with entering
into any collective

  



        
   

  



  

bargaining or any other type of collective labor or union agreement, and
there is no labor union or other organization representing employees of the
Acquired Companies, and there are no organizing activities or collective
bargaining arrangements involving the Acquired Companies that could affect
employees of the Acquired Companies. No Acquired Company is in negotiation
with any relevant staff or works council to change any fundamental terms and
conditions of employment. No strike, work stoppage, lockout, labor suit or
proceeding, union grievance, union representation question or labor
administrative proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
threatened respecting employees of the Acquired Companies, and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, no such matter has been threatened within the two (2)
year period prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, in the two (2) years prior to the
date hereof and to the present, no Acquired Company is or has been a party to
Proceeding or otherwise the subject of a complaint, grievance or demand in
which such Acquired Company or any of its officers, directors, supervisory or
management employees was, or is, alleged to have violated any applicable
Laws, or any Orders of any Governmental Authority, or any arbitration awards,
relating to employment, labor practices, equal opportunity, affirmative
action, nondiscrimination, harassment, retaliation, immigration, wages,
hours, benefits, collective bargaining, the payment of social security and
similar taxes, income tax withholding, and/or privacy rights of employees of
the Acquired Companies (collectively "Labor and Employment Matters") that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material effect on the Acquired Companies, nor has any Acquired Company
internally conducted an audit and/or otherwise discovered any Labor and
Employment Matters that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies. The
Acquired Companies are not a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent
decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Authority relating to employees
or employment practices.

  



  

(c) The Acquired Companies have withheld and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority or are holding for payment not yet due to such
Governmental Authority all amounts required to be withheld from employees of
the Acquired Companies and are not liable for any arrears of wages, Taxes,
penalties or other sums for failure to comply with any applicable Laws
relating to the employment of labor.  The Acquired Companies have paid in
full to all their respective employees or adequately accrued in accordance
with GAAP for all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other
compensation due to or on behalf of such employees.

  



  

(d) To the Knowledge of Sellers, as of the date hereof, no current officer of
any of the Acquired Companies intends, or is reasonably expected, to
terminate his or her **** employment relationship with such entity upon, or
in connection with, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, in the two (2) years prior to the
date hereof, no Acquired Company has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" as
defined in the WARN Act (or any similar state, local or foreign Law)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of the Acquired Companies or (ii) a
"mass layoff" as defined in the WARN Act (or any similar state, local or
foreign

  



        
   

  



  

applicable Law) affecting any site of employment or facility of the Acquired
Companies with respect to any site of employment or facility of any of the
employees employed by them.

  



  

Section 3.19 _Taxes_. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19,

  



  

(a) All federal and all material state, local and foreign Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired Company have been
timely filed in accordance with applicable Laws, and each such Tax Return is
accurate and complete in all material respects.  All Taxes due and owing by
any Acquired Company, either as reported on any Tax Return, or as
subsequently assessed by a taxing authority, have been paid. No Acquired
Company has granted any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations
period, or of the time for assessment or collection, applicable to any Tax,
Tax Return, or Tax assessment or deficiency which period (after giving effect
to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired. No claim has ever been
made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where any Acquired
Company does not file Tax Returns that the Acquired Companies are or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) There is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit, claim,
collection or assessment pending, being conducted or, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, proposed or threatened, with respect to any Tax Return or Taxes with
respect to any Acquired Company. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any of
the material assets of the Acquired Companies except Liens relating to
current Taxes not yet due or for Taxes that are being contested in good faith
through appropriate legal proceedings. All Taxes which any Acquired Company
is required by applicable Law to withhold or to collect have been duly
withheld and collected and have been paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, and the Acquired Companies have complied with all information
reporting and withholding requirements, in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or
other third party. There are no requests for rulings or determinations in
respect of any Tax pending between any Acquired Company and any Governmental
Authority. There are no closing agreements or similar arrangements with any
Governmental Authority with regard to the determination of the Tax liability
of any Acquired Company.

  



  

(c) No Acquired Company has received written notice of a foreign, federal,
state, or local tax audit or administrative or judicial Tax proceeding which
is pending or is being conducted with respect to any Acquired Company. No
Acquired Company has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local
taxing authority (including jurisdictions where any Acquired Company has not
filed Tax Returns) any written (i) notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters,
or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax
proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against any Acquired
Company. Sellers have delivered or made available to Buyer correct and
complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and
statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Acquired
Companies filed or received in the last three years and has indicated which
of those Tax Returns has been audited or currently are the subject of an
audit.

  



  

(d) No Acquired Company is a party to, or is bound by, any tax indemnity
agreement or tax sharing agreement (other than any such agreements solely
between or among

  



        
   

  



  

the Acquired Companies). No Acquired Company has assumed the Tax liability
of any other Person under contract (other than pursuant to the tax sharing
agreements referred to in the preceding sentence).

  



  

(e) No Acquired Company is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
plan that has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in
the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code
Section 280G (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law) and (ii) any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of
Code Section 162(m) (or any corresponding provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law). Each Acquired Company has disclosed on its federal income
Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662.

  



  

(f) No Acquired Company has engaged, or been deemed to have engaged, in a
"reportable transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b), or any transaction that is the same as or substantially similar
to one of the types of transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax
avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation, or other form of
published guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

  



  

(g) No Acquired Company has distributed stock of another Person, or has had
its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported
or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code Section 355 or 361.

  



  

(h) Except for the consolidated group for which the common parent is the
Company, no Acquired Company has been a member of an affiliated group filing
a consolidated, combined, affiliated, unitary or similar Tax Return or has
any liability for the Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 3.20 _Brokers  or Finders Fees_. Except for Bank of America
Merrill Lynch or BBandT Capital Markets, whose fees and expenses will be paid
by Sellers, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of the Acquired Companies or Sellers who might be entitled to any fee
or commission in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 3.21 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as provided for in this
Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 3.21, there are no material Contracts

and a Seller or Affiliate thereof (excluding the Acquired Companies), on the
other hand.

  



  

Section 3.22 _Dividends, Bonuses and Other Distributions_. Except as set forth

money, property or any other thing of value, declared, issued or paid to or
for the benefit of Sellers, in their capacities as stockholders of the
Company, subsequent to December 31, 2009 by the

  



        
   

  



  

Acquired Companies, nor, as of the date hereof, any intent or commitment of
the part of the Acquired Companies or Sellers to do the same prior to the
Closing Date and, as of the date hereof, there are no such bonuses, dividends
or other distributions for the benefit of the Sellers, in such capacities,
accrued and unpaid.

  



  

Section 3.23 _Internal Controls_. The Acquired Companies maintain a system
of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (b) transactions are recorded as necessary (1) to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (2)
to maintain accountability for assets.

and warranties contained in this Article III (as modified by the Schedules

ARTICLE IV

  



  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

  



  

Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers that all of the statements contained
in this Article IV are true as of the date hereof:

  



  

Section 4.1 _Organization. _Each of Parent and Buyer is a Delaware
corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as is now being conducted. Each
of Parent and Buyer is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on such Party.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement_. Each of Parent and Buyer
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the
Transaction Documents to which it is specified to be a party and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which
it is specified to be a party, and the consummation by each of Parent and
Buyer of the Contemplated Transactions, have been duly authorized by such
Party, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Buyer are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by such Party of any
Transaction Document to which it is specified to be a party or the
consummation by such Party of the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Buyer. Assuming the due and
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sellers,
this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Buyer, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its
terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.  Assuming the due
and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by each other party
thereto, each other Transaction Document to which Parent or Buyer is
specified to be a party (when executed and delivered by such Party) shall
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable
against such Party in accordance with its terms, except that (i)
such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.  Neither the execution,
delivery or performance by Parent or Buyer of any Transaction Document to
which it is specified to be a party, nor the consummation by Parent or Buyer
of the Contemplated Transactions, will (i) violate any provision of any
Organizational Documents of Parent or Buyer; (ii) except with respect to
consents required under the Contracts set forth on Schedule 4.3, result in a
breach of,

  



        
   

  



  

or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument
or obligation to which Parent or Buyer is a party or by which Parent or Buyer
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound; it being
understood that "material" for purposes of this Section 4.3 means, with
respect to Parent or Buyer, any agreement or instrument, filed, or required
to be filed, by Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries with,
or disclosed, or required to be disclosed, by Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in a filing with, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission; (iii) violate any material Orders or Laws applicable to Parent or
Buyer or any of their respective material properties or assets; it being
understood that a "material Order" applicable to Parent or Buyer means
an Order filed, or required to be filed, by Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries with, or disclosed, or required to be disclosed, by
Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries in a filing with, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; or (iv) except as set forth on
Schedule 4.3 and except for filings pursuant to the HSR Act, require on the
part of Parent or Buyer any filing or registration with, notification to, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority, except, in
the cases of clause (iv) above, as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
Buyer.  Parent and Buyer acknowledge that if Buyer requests a U.S.
Government Customer to recognize Buyer as a successor in interest under a
Government Contract, additional notifications and U.S. Government consents
not set forth on Schedule 4.3 or herein may be necessary.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Purchase for Investment, etc_.

  



  

(a) Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of that term as
defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.

  



  

(b) The Shares will be acquired for investment for Buyers own account and
not with a view to the distribution of any part thereof in violation of the
Securities Act. Buyer does not have any contract, undertaking or agreement
with any Person to sell, transfer, or grant participations with respect to
any of the Shares.

  



  

(c) Buyers financial condition is such that it is able to bear the risk of
holding the Shares for an indefinite period of time and can bear the loss of
its entire investment in its Shares.

  



  

(d) Buyer (either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. Buyer
has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the Evaluation
Material, the Acquired Companies, the Business and the assets, liabilities,
results of operations and financial condition of the Acquired Companies, and
acknowledges that Buyer has been provided reasonable access to certain
personnel, premises and records of the Acquired Companies for such purpose
and that Buyer and its Representatives have been provided with reasonable
opportunities to ask questions of the officers and certain management
employees of the Acquired Companies and Sellers and to acquire such certain
additional information about the

  



        
   

  



  

Business and the financial condition of the Acquired Companies as Buyer and
its Representatives have reasonably requested; provided, however, that this
acknowledgement shall, in no way, abate or relieve Sellers of their
obligations under Article III.

  



  

(e) In entering into this Agreement, Parent and Buyer have relied solely upon
their own investigation and analysis (provided that such reliance shall, in
no way, abate or relieve Sellers of their obligations under Article III) and,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Acquired Companies or Sellers, nor
any of their respective Representatives, is making any representations
or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by
Sellers in Article III (as modified by the Schedules hereto), and that any
claims which Parent or Buyer may have for breach of a representation or
warranty shall be based solely on the representations and warranties of
Sellers expressly set forth in Article III (as modified by the Schedules
hereto).

  



  

(f) Buyer acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act or under any state or foreign securities laws.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Proceedings; Orders_. There are no Proceedings before or by any
Governmental Authority, or to Buyers knowledge, investigations by any
Governmental Authority, pending or, to Buyers knowledge, threatened, against
Parent or Buyer, nor are there any Orders naming Parent or Buyer, except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
materially adverse to the ability of Parent or Buyer to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Brokers or Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to
act on behalf of Parent or Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.7 _No Foreign Status, etc_. None of Parent or Buyer or any
intended transferee or assignee from Buyer of the Business, the Acquired
Companies or any rights hereunder is a "foreign person" and no aspect of
Parents or Buyers organization, structure, ownership, financing, operation
or otherwise is capable of causing the Contemplated Transactions to be deemed
a "covered transaction" as that term is defined in FINSA.  For purposes of
the foregoing, a "foreign person" is any foreign national (i.e., an
individual who is not a U.S. national), foreign government, or foreign
Person, or any Person over which control is exercised or exercisable by a
foreign national, foreign government, or any other foreign Person. Buyer does
not violate the foreign ownership prohibition under ATSA.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Sufficiency of Funds_. Buyer will have, at the Closing,
sufficient liquid funds (through cash on hand, credit arrangements or
otherwise) (1) to pay all amounts to be paid under this Agreement, including
payment of the Closing Purchase Price, (2) to make all other necessary
payments of fees and expenses in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, and (3) to perform and discharge its obligations under the
Transaction Documents and in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Buyer expressly acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are not subject
to any conditions, express or implied, regarding Parents or Buyers ability
to obtain financing for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 4.9 _Solvency_.  Immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated
Transactions and any Indebtedness incurred by Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection herewith, each of Parent, Buyer and their
respective Subsidiaries, including each of the Acquired Companies, shall be
solvent and shall (i) be able to pay its debts as they become due, (ii) own
property that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
all contingent liabilities), and (iii) have adequate capital to carry on its
business. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being
incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any of Parent,
Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries, including each Acquired Company.
 In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor
Buyer has incurred, or plans to incur, debts beyond its ability to pay
as they become absolute and matured.

records of Sellers relating to the Acquired Companies and the Business, (ii)
furnish, and cause the Acquired Companies to furnish, to Buyer, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the Acquired
Companies and the Business as such Persons may reasonably request, and (iii)
instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Sellers and the
Acquired Companies to cooperate with Buyers reasonable requests in its
investigation of the Acquired Companies and the Business; _provided_ that
any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be conducted only
upon reasonable notice by Buyer to Sellers and the Acquired Companies in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business; and
_provided, further,_ that without the prior written consent of Sellers, Buyer
and its Representatives shall not be entitled to any such access, information
or documents (a) to the extent that access to, or disclosure of, such
information or documents would pursuant to the advice of Sellers counsel,
waive or jeopardize, or reasonably be expected to waive or jeopardize, the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine, (b) the
disclosure of which is restricted by any Law or Order applicable to any
Acquired Company or Seller, (c) the disclosure of which contravenes any
Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which an Acquired Company, a Seller, or an
Affiliate thereof is a party), or (d) the disclosure of which would cause
material competitive harm to the Acquired Companies, Sellers, or any
Affiliate thereof if the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated (after
taking into account any reasonable proposals made by Buyer to avoid
such material competitive harm). Buyer is not authorized to and shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their Representatives not to)
contact any customer, supplier, or other material business relation of any
Acquired Company prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of
Sellers. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to such access and any information furnished to it, its Affiliates or
its or their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.2.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Notices from Governmental Authorities_.  From the date hereof
through the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, promptly notify Buyer of any material notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority to any Acquired Company or
Seller in connection with (a) the Contemplated Transactions; (b) matters of
the type disclosed in Sections 3.9 and 3.10 hereof, the occurrence of
which would result in the breach of

  



        
   

  



  

the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.9 and 3.10, as if
made on and as of the Closing Date, or (c) the termination, on or after the
date hereof, of any Government Contracts with U.S. Government Customers
constituting Material Contracts (excluding individual task orders, purchase
orders or delivery orders).

  



  

Section 5.4 _Resignations_. Sellers shall cause each director and officer of
each Acquired Company who is not an employee of the Acquired Companies
to submit his or her resignation as a director or officer of such
Acquired Company, effective as of the Closing Date, other than those Persons
whom Buyer specifies to Sellers at least ten (10) days prior the Closing
Date.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Indebtedness; Affiliate Transactions_. At the Closing, Sellers
shall cause (i) all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies to be paid in
full, or otherwise discharged in full (including, without limitation, by
instructing Buyer, in accordance with Section 2.4(a) to pay a portion of the
Directed Closing Purchase Price to the holders of the Indebtedness of the
Acquired Companies in an aggregate amount sufficient to repay all of such
Indebtedness), and (ii) the release of any and all Liens on the Shares or any
of the assets or properties of the Acquired Companies (other than Permitted
Liens). Except as set forth on Schedule 5.5 or as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Sellers shall cause, effective as of the Closing,
each outstanding Contract (including those relating to management and similar
fees payable by any Acquired Company to any Seller or Affiliate thereof)
between a Seller or Affiliate thereof (excluding any Acquired Company), on
the one hand, and any Acquired Company, on the other hand, to be terminated,
without any further liability or obligations of Sellers or any Affiliate
thereof, or any Acquired Company, thereunder.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Acquisition Proposals_. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement, (x)
Sellers will not, and will cause the Acquired Companies and the Sellers and
the Acquired Companies respective Representatives not to: (i)
solicit, initiate, entertain or engage in discussions or negotiations with
any person (whether such discussions or negotiations are initiated by them or
otherwise), or solicit proposals from any person, other than Buyer, Parent
and their respective Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the **"Buyer Parties"** ), with respect to
(a) any purchase, sale or other disposition of a material portion of the
business or assets of the Acquired Companies, (b) any issuances, sales or
other dispositions of equity interests in the Acquired Companies (other than
equity interests in a joint venture formed on or after the date hereof), (c)
any mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or similar business combination
transactions involving the Acquired Companies, or (d) any other transactions
the purpose or effect of which would be to prevent the Transaction (each of
the foregoing defined as an "Alternative Transaction"); (ii) provide any
information with respect to the Acquired Companies to any person, other than
a Buyer Party, in connection with an Alternative Transaction; or (iii) enter
into any agreement (whether or not binding or definitive) with any person,
other than a Buyer Party, concerning or relating to an Alternative
Transaction; and (y) if Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Representatives receives any unsolicited offer, proposal,
communication or expression of interest regarding an Alternative Transaction
or engages in any negotiations or discussions relating to an Alternative
Transaction (in each case other than from a Buyer Party), Sellers shall
notify Buyer and Parent of such fact (to the extent known to them).

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.7 _Disclosure Schedule Supplements_. From time to time prior to the
Closing, Sellers will supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing or occurring at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to complete or
correct any information in such schedule or in any representation and
warranty of Sellers which has been rendered inaccurate thereby.  If accepted
in writing by Buyer (whose acceptance thereof will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), any such supplemental or amended
disclosure shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of the indemnification provided
for in Article IX hereof, but will not be deemed to have cured any such
breach of representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof
have been satisfied.

COVENANTS OF BUYER

  



  

Section 6.1 _Confidentiality_. Prior to the Closing Date and after
any termination of this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates will hold, and
will use their respective Best Efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of applicable
Law, all documents and information concerning the Acquired Companies, Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates furnished to Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (i) previously known on a
nonconfidential basis by Buyer, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (iii) later lawfully acquired by Buyer from
sources other than the Acquired Companies or Sellers, which sources are not,
to Buyers knowledge, subject to any legally binding obligation to the
Acquired Companies to keep such information confidential; _ provided_ that
Buyer may disclose such information to its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and to its
lenders or other Persons in connection with obtaining the financing for the
Contemplated Transactions so long as such Persons are informed by Buyer of
the confidential nature of such information and are directed by Buyer to
treat such information confidentially. The obligation of Buyer and its
Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if
they exercise the same care with respect to such information as they would
take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar information. If
this Agreement is terminated, (x) Buyer and its Affiliates will, and will use
their respective Best Efforts to cause their respective Representatives and
their lenders and such other Persons to, destroy or deliver to Sellers, upon
request, all documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, obtained
by Buyer or its Affiliates or on their behalf from any Acquired Company or
Seller in connection with this Agreement that are subject to such confidence
and (y) Buyer shall certify in writing to Sellers that all documents and
other materials subject to the confidentiality restrictions of this Section
6.1 shall have been destroyed or returned to the Acquired Companies or
Sellers, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Access_. On and after the Closing Date, during normal business
hours, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and its
other Affiliates to, afford promptly to Sellers and their
Representatives reasonable access to their properties, books of

  



        
   

  



  

account, financial and other records (including, without limitation,
accountants work papers), employees and auditors to the extent necessary in
connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or other
reasonable business purpose relating to Sellers rights or obligations under
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or otherwise in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions or to determine any matter
relating to any period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ that
any such access by Sellers shall be during normal business hours and shall
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification; Insurance._

  



  

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation now existing in favor of each individual who, as of the
Closing Date, is a present or former director or officer of an Acquired
Company (the " **Covered Persons** ") as provided in the Organizational
Documents of the applicable Acquired Company, in effect as of the date
hereof, shall, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date,
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect after the Closing
Date. Until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Acquired Company shall, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Covered Persons than are set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the applicable Acquired Company, in effect as of the date
hereof, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or the rights
thereunder of any Covered Person as of the Closing Date adversely affected,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date. Buyer further
agrees that all rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses now
existing in favor of Covered Persons in any indemnification agreement between
such person and the applicable Acquired Company, or under applicable Law,
shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of such agreement or applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Sellers intend that the Company acquire a six (6) year Discovery
Period, effective as of the Closing Date, pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the existing Directors, Officers and Private Company Liability
Insurance Policy Number 01-369-49-11 issued by National Union Fire Insurance
Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. ( **"D and O Tail Coverage"**). In the event the
Company has not secured such D and O Tail Coverage by the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cooperate, and shall cause the Company to cooperate, with Sellers in
Sellers efforts to acquire the D and O Tail Coverage after the Closing Date.
The cost of the DandO Tail Coverage obtained after the Closing Date will be
paid by Sellers.

  



  

(c) In the event that Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns after the Closing (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company (or their successors or
assigns) assume the obligations of Buyer and/or the applicable Acquired
Company (or their successors or assigns) as contemplated by this Section
6.3; provided that this subsection (c) shall not apply to any merger
or consolidation between the Buyer and another wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent so long as

  



        
   

  



  

the Buyer causes Parent, prior to the consummation of such merger or
consolidation, to assume the obligations of Buyer and/or the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, as set forth in this Section 6.3.

  



  

(d) Buyer and/or the applicable Acquired Company shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, that may
be incurred by any Covered Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 6.3; provided, however, that such
Covered Person must qualify for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3
and otherwise satisfy the requirements for indemnification under the
applicable Organizational Document and, if such asserted right is contested,
it must have been Finally Determined that such Covered Person was entitled to
such indemnification. The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the
consummation of the Closing and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Covered Persons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, it is agreed that the rights of a Covered Person under this
Section 6.3 shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other
rights such Covered Person may have under the Organizational Documents of the
applicable Acquired Company, any other indemnification arrangements, the DGCL
or otherwise, and nothing in this Section 6.3 shall have the effect of, or be
construed as having the effect of, reducing the benefits to the Covered
Persons under the Organizational Documents of the applicable Acquired
Company, any other indemnification arrangements, the DGCL or otherwise with
respect to matters occurring prior to the applicable Closing Date.

practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Sellers and Buyer shall, with respect to a threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the Parties hereto to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, to
use their respective Best Efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

  



  

(d) Sellers and Buyer agree, and Sellers, prior to the Closing, and Buyer,
after the Closing, agree to cause the Acquired Companies, to execute and
deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and

contemplated herein, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with
any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing Parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any
such filing or the transaction contemplated herein. Each such Party shall
use its Best Efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Each such Party shall promptly
inform the other Parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide

Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject
to applicable Law, the Parties hereto will consult and cooperate with

  



        
   

  



  

one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,

other Antitrust Laws. Any Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other Parties under this Section 7.2 or otherwise as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials. In furtherance of the foregoing, both parties agree to use their
respective Best Efforts to take any and all steps necessary to receive
regulatory clearance under any Antitrust Laws to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, including litigating, pursuing or defending against any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding (including any
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) challenging any of
the Contemplated Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Public Announcements_. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, shall not issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless, in the reasonable
judgment of Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise required
by applicable Law (including the United States securities laws); _provided_ ,
that, to the extent any such disclosure is required by applicable Law, the
Party or Parties intending to make such disclosure shall use its or their
Best Efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult with the other(s) with
respect to the content and timing of any such disclosure before such
disclosure is made. Sellers and Buyer will consult with each other concerning
the means by which employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings
with the Acquired Companies will be informed of this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, and the Acquired Companies and Sellers will have
the right to be present for any such communication.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefit Matters. _Employees of the Acquired Companies
may be migrated to Buyers employee benefit plans provided such migration is
on substantially the same terms, requirements and conditions as apply to
similarly situated employees of Buyer. Buyer hereby agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to grant all
employees of the Acquired Companies credit for any service with the Acquired
Companies earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual purposes (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan) and (ii) for purposes of carryover of accrued and unused
vacation balances under any benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies on or after the
Closing Date (the **"New Plans"** ). In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that
it shall cause (i) the Acquired Companies to waive all pre-existing
condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans, and (ii) any covered expenses incurred on
or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of
the Acquired Companies to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after

for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and shall make, or
cause to be made, such records available to the other Party as may be
reasonably requested by the other Party (i) in connection with, among other
things, any Tax audits, any insurance claims by, Proceedings by or against,
or governmental investigations of, Sellers, Buyer, GLS or any of
their respective Affiliates or (ii) in order to enable Sellers or Buyer
to comply with their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents
and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated thereby.
The requesting Party or its Representatives shall be permitted to make copies
of such records, in each case at no cost to the requesting Party or
its Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses);
_provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall require a Party to disclose,
or cause to be disclosed, any information to the other if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene
any applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" **Straddle Period** "), the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period
which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

  



  

(b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or caused
to be prepared and file or caused to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company
and its Subsidiaries which are filed after the Closing Date (other than
income tax returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary
or combined income tax return of Sellers will include the operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries). Buyer shall deliver to Sellers copies of
any Straddle Period Tax Returns (other than any such Straddle Period Tax
Returns that are filed on a monthly basis) no later than twenty (20) calendar
days before filing for approval by Sellers, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Promptly after such approval is given, but
in no event later than the due date for filing such Straddle Period Tax
Returns, the amount representing the liability for Pre-Closing Taxes on such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be paid from (and to the extent of) the
Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by Buyer to the Escrow
Agent, (and Buyer and Sellers shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to promptly make such payment). Buyer
shall within ten (10) Business Days provide copies of any Straddle Period Tax
Return filed, in each case together with proof of full payment of all
liabilities shown thereon and evidence of timely filing thereof.

  



         
 

  



  

(c) _Cooperation of Tax Matters_. (i) Buyer, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this section and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

  



  

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries and Sellers agree (A) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and
its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and the extent
notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other Party so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records; (ii) Buyer and Sellers further agree,
upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby); and (iii) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to provide
the other party with all information that either party may be required to
report pursuant to Code §6043 and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  



  

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Except with respect to Tax sharing or
similar agreements solely between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries,
all Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date,
and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  



  

(f) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by Sellers when due, and Sellers will, at
their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by
applicable law, Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Any amounts
required to be paid by Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.6(f) shall be from
the Escrow Account.

Sellers brokers, lawyers and advisors have been paid for their services in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or that provision for
payment by Sellers has been made, including, without limitation, by written
direction by Sellers that a specified portion of the

  



        
   

  



  

Directed Closing Purchase Price be applied to payment for services), to the
extent the Acquired Companies would have liability for payment for such
services; and

  



  

(e) No Governmental Authority shall have issued any Order (and no
Proceeding (other than any Proceeding brought or threatened by Parent, Buyer
or any Affiliate thereof) seeking any of the foregoing shall be pending),
which restrains, enjoins or prohibits the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Conditions to Obligation of Sellers_. In addition to the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 above, the obligations of Sellers to
consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction, or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by Sellers, on or prior to the
Closing Date, of each of the following further conditions:

  



  

(a) Each of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date as if made on such
date, except to the extent such representations and warranties relate to an
earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date), except
for such breaches or inaccuracies of the representations and warranties of
Buyer that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Buyer;

  



  

(b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all respects with all
covenants and obligations under Section 2.4 of this Agreement required to be
performed and complied with by it as of the Closing Date, including the

ARTICLE IX

  



  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 9.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties
under this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing and shall continue in full
force and effect (a) in the case of any representation and warranty of
the Sellers set forth in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.17, 3.18 or 3.19, and
any representation and warranty of the Parent and Buyer set forth in Section
4.1 or 4.2, until the

  



        
   

  



  

eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of
each other representation and warranty of the Sellers, Parent or Buyer, until
the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date. The covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing Date shall continue in full force and effect
after the Closing until performed in accordance with their terms or, if
earlier, the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date. The
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are
to be performed solely between the date hereof and the Closing shall not
survive the Closing. No action for a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be brought after the expiration of the
survival of such representation or warranty, except for claims of which a
Party has received written notification prior to such expiration
setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such claim (including a
reasonable specification of the legal and factual basis for such claim). This
Section 9.1 shall not restrict or limit a Partys right to commence any claim
with respect to any covenant or agreement of the Parties contained in this
Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance, in whole or in part,
after the Closing.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, to the extent provided in this Article
IX, Sellers shall indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, " **Buyer
Indemnitees** ") against and hold them harmless from any loss, liability,
cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) (collectively,
" **Losses** ") suffered or incurred by such Buyer Indemnitees to the extent
arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of a Seller
contained in this Agreement (other than a breach of Section 3.19, to the
extent that such Losses arising from such breach constitute Pre-Closing
Taxes), (ii) any breach of any covenant or undertaking of a Seller contained
in this Agreement, (iii) all Pre-Closing Taxes, except to the extent that
a breach by Buyer of its obligations contained in Section 7.6(b) results in
Losses but only to the extent that such breach increases such Losses, or (iv)
any failure by GLS to withhold payroll taxes for its Iraqi national employees
(to the extent required under applicable Law) from June 27, 2004 to
the Closing Date (it being understood that any Losses suffered or incurred by
the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this clause (iv) shall be limited to 49%
of any Losses suffered or incurred by GLS). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for (A)
those portions of any Losses that represent lost profits, diminution in
value, restitution, mental or emotional distress, exemplary, consequential,
incidental, special or punitive damages except to the extent that any of the
same are paid by a Buyer Indemnitee to a third party in connection with a
claim asserted by such third party; or (B) those portions of any Losses (i)
paid for by any Acquired Company in the Financial Statements prior to the
Closing Date or otherwise paid or provided for (directly, and not through any
Acquired Company) by a Seller or any of its Affiliates, (ii) that are
reimbursed from insurance proceeds actually received and retained, or (iii)
that have arisen as a result of any act or omission by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates on or after the Closing Date (including, without limitation,
Losses resulting from any change in accounting principles, practices or
methodologies and Losses arising from any breach of its obligations under
this Agreement. Solely for purposes of this Article IX, any determination of
whether a breach of any representation or warranty of a Seller contained in
Section 3.17 or 3.18 of this Agreement has occurred shall be made
disregarding the disclosure of the Specified Lawsuits on the Disclosure
Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement,

  



        
   

  



  

(i) the Buyer shall assume and control the defense of each Specified Lawsuit
(whereupon the provisions set forth in Section 9.6(b) which govern a Third
Party Proceeding if the Indemnifying Party has not assumed and controlled the
defense of such Third Party Proceeding in accordance with Section 9.6(b)
shall apply to such Specified Lawsuit (including the provisions therein
governing settlement of a Third Party Proceeding)), unless it would be
reasonably expected that at least 50% of the reasonably estimated Losses for
which the Acquired Companies would be liable thereunder would be paid from
the Escrow Funds (assuming that the Buyer Indemnitees would be entitled to
indemnification therefor pursuant to this Article IX and after giving effect
to the Deductible), in which case the Sellers may elect, in their sole
discretion, by written notice to the Buyer, to assume and control the defense
of such Specified Lawsuit (whereupon the provisions set forth in Section
9.6(b) which govern a Third Party Proceeding already assumed and controlled
by the Indemnifying Party would apply (including the provisions therein
governing settlement of a Third Party Proceeding)), and (ii) the Sellers and
the Buyer shall consult with each other regarding any material decisions to
be made in connection with the defense of each Specified Lawsuit.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to reimbursement or indemnification
from Sellers with respect to any inaccuracies in or breaches of the
representations and warranties made by Sellers (or either of them) hereunder
unless (x) the Loss related to each individual claim or series of related
claims exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), and (y) the aggregate amount
of such Losses suffered or incurred by all Buyer Indemnitees (after giving
effect to the limitation in clause (x) above) exceeds an amount equal to Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the **"Deductible"** ), and then only for the
amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible, and (ii) in no event shall
Sellers aggregate liability under Section 9.2(a) exceed Thirty Five Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($35,500,000). For avoidance of doubt, the
Deductible shall not apply to claims for indemnification by the Buyer
Indemnitees (or any of them) with respect to breaches of the covenants
or agreements of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing Date, to
the extent provided in this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to indemnify, jointly and severally, Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents ("
**Seller Indemnitees** ") against and hold them harmless from any Losses
suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitees to the extent arising from
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or undertaking of Buyer contained
in this Agreement, (iii) all Post-Closing Taxes, (iv) except with respect to
any matter for which Buyer is indemnified under Section 9.2, the operation of
the Acquired Companies and its Business from and after the Closing Date, (v)
subject to Section 3.18, the WARN Act (or any similar foreign, state or local
Law), to the extent any mass layoff or termination, as defined by the WARN
Act, is commenced or otherwise initiated after the Closing and authorized by
Buyer; provided said indemnification obligation does not inure directly to
the benefit of any individual or group of employees, officers, or agents of
the Acquired Companies, or (vi) subject to Section 3.18, any claims for
severance or other termination benefits asserted against Sellers or their
Affiliates by any employee of any Acquired Company who is terminated from and
after the Closing, except for such terminations that were commenced or
otherwise initiated prior to the Closing by written notice of termination
given to the employee (whether subject to the expiration of a notice period
or otherwise); provided, that, for avoidance of doubt,

  



        
   

  



  

any claims for severance by any such employees shall, as between the Acquired
Companies, Buyer and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and such employees,
on the other hand, be governed by the applicable severance agreements or
policies of Buyer in effect at the time of termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification for (A) those portions of any Losses that represent lost
profits, diminution in value, restitution, mental or emotional distress,
exemplary, consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages except to
the extent that any of the same are paid by a Seller Indemnitee to a third
party in connection with a claim asserted by such third party; or (B) those
portions of any Losses (i) that are reimbursed from insurance proceeds
actually received and retained, or (ii) that have arisen as a result of any
act or omission by any Seller or any of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Single Recovery_. Any liability for indemnification under this
Article IX shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the set of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking, or one or more
rights to indemnification, including any matter for which any reserve or
accrual has been established in the Financial Statements or in the books and
records of the Acquired Companies in accordance with GAAP.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the
event that any fact, event or circumstance which results in an adjustment to
the purchase price pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof would also constitute a
breach or inaccuracy of any of a Partys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement or otherwise result in a Loss to
the other Party, such Party shall have no obligation to indemnify any
Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such breach or inaccuracy
to the extent that (i) recovery for any such Loss would constitute a
duplicative payment of amounts recovered as a purchase price adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.6, or (ii) such Loss was reflected as a liability on
the Closing Balance Sheet.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6
(Purchase Price Adjustment), Section 2.8 (GLS Related Payments), or Section
11.17 (Specific Performance), Parent, Buyer and Sellers each acknowledge and
agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, that,
from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims relating to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and
undertakings contained in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Parent, Buyer and Sellers hereby waive, for themselves and on
behalf of their respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights of rescission with respect to the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 9.6 Indemnification Procedures.

  



  

(a) If a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeks to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 (other than in respect of a
third party claim, action or proceeding referred to in Section 9.6(b)) (the "
**Indemnified Party** "), the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice
of such claim to the Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is
sought with respect thereto (collectively, an " **Indemnifying Party** "),
setting forth the nature of the claim and the basis for indemnification
hereunder (to the extent known to the Indemnified Party).

  



        
   

  



  

(b) If, following the Closing, any claim is asserted or action or proceeding
commenced or threatened by a third party against an Indemnified Party that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification by
such Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.2
or 9.3 (each, a **"Third-Party Proceeding"** ), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such asserted,
commenced or threatened Third-Party Proceeding and the basis for
indemnification thereunder (to the extent known to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to provide such notice as provided herein will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such
failure adversely prejudices in any significant respect the Indemnifying
Party hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding giving rise such claim for
indemnification at such Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, and, at
its option (and its sole cost and expense), shall be entitled to assume
and control the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to be the lead counsel in
connection with such defense, and shall diligently and in good faith
prosecute such Third-Party Proceeding to a final conclusion or settlement
(subject to the applicable limitations on settlement set forth in this
Section 9.6). As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of such asserted, commenced or threatened Proceeding), the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether the
Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to participate in,
or, at its election, assume and control, the defense of such Third-
Party Proceeding. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding (but shall not be entitled to
control such defense, if the Indemnifying Party has timely notified the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume and control such defense) and to
employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided, however,_
that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party, unless, in the Indemnified Partys good faith judgment, it
is advisable, based on the advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be
represented by separate counsel because of a conflict or potential conflict
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, in which case the
Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, to participate in such defense with respect to such matters as to
which such conflict exists. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume
and control the defense of any such Third-Party Proceeding in accordance with
this Section 9.6(b), the Indemnified Party agrees to provide reasonable
cooperation to (and, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to provide access to all relevant documents and records and to make
all relevant personnel available to) the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding. If the Indemnifying
Party shall not assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding
in accordance with this Section 9.6(b), (i) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any
settlement, compromise or discharge, with respect to such Third-Party
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article IX for any
judgment, settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Proceeding
made by the Indemnified Party not made in accordance with clause (i) above.
If the Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense of any such
Third-Party Proceeding in accordance with this Section 9.6(b), the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to consent
to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement, compromise
or discharge, with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding;
_provided however,_ that the Indemnifying

  



        
   

  



  

Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, before approving any
judgment with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding, or entering into any
settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Proceeding, if (i)
pursuant to, or as a result of, such judgment, settlement or compromise,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) such judgment, settlement or compromise
does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Proceeding (other than solely
with respect to the Deductible (to the extent such liabilities would
constitute Losses to which the Deductible would be applicable in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Section 9.2 or Section 9.3) in which case
the amount thereof shall be deemed applied to the satisfaction of such
Deductible), (iii) such judgment, settlement, compromise or discharge
contains or involves (x) an admission or statement providing for or
acknowledging any criminal wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (y) the debarment or suspension
by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates from being awarded future
Government Contracts, or (iv) if the Indemnifying Party consists of one or
both of the Sellers, the then-remaining Escrow Funds shall be insufficient to
satisfy any liabilities resulting from such judgment, settlement, compromise
or discharge (unless the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to
be responsible for satisfying any such liabilities, to the extent the then-
remaining Escrow Funds shall be insufficient for such purpose).

  



  

(c) _Adjustments for Insurance and Taxes_. Each Loss which an Indemnifying
Party is required to pay pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced (i)
by any amounts actually recovered and retained by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for such Loss (it being understood that each
Indemnified Party shall be required to use its Best Efforts to pursue all
available insurance recoveries in connection with any indemnification claim
hereunder), and (ii) to take account of any reduction of net Taxes actually
realized by the Indemnified Party as a direct result of such Loss (determined
after properly taking into account the actual and reasonably anticipated
effect on (including increase of) Taxes (including future Taxes) of the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof as a result of any indemnification
amount paid or payable for such Loss under this Article IX). If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Loss or obtains any
reduction of net Taxes, in each case, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

  



  

(d) _Recovery for Claims for Indemnification._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the
aggregate liability of Sellers in respect of all claims for indemnification
of the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, and the aggregate amount of Losses
indemnifiable under this Agreement in respect thereof, at any time shall in
no event exceed the Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow Account and all
claims for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, pursuant
to this Article IX shall be asserted solely against the Escrow Funds then
remaining in the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and such
Escrow Funds shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery for

  



        
   

  



  

the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, for any amounts owing to them pursuant
to this Article IX. Upon the Final Determination of any amount of Losses to
which any Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article IX, Buyer and Sellers shall execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such amount from
the then-remaining Escrow Funds in the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
separate written payment instructions of the Buyer Indemnitee.

  



  

(e) _Mitigation. _Each Indemnified Party shall use its Best Efforts to
mitigate any claim or liability that an Indemnified Party asserts or may
assert under this Article IX. In the event that an Indemnified Party
shall fail to use its Best Efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Sellers nor Buyer, as the case may be, shall be required to indemnify
any Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that would reasonably
be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had used such
Best Efforts.

  



  

(f) _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have against any other persons with
respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably require to perfect such subrogation or to pursue such rights
against such other persons as the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may
have.

  



  

(g) _Treatment of Indemnity Claims_. Any indemnification payment made by a
Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price hereunder and no party shall take any position
inconsistent with such characterization.

  



  

ARTICLE X

  



  

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

  



  

Section 10.1 _Grounds for Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written agreement of Sellers and Buyer;

  



  

(b) by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside
Date,  _provided_ that Buyer is not at the time of such election to
terminate in breach in any material respect of any of its obligations
hereunder;

  



  

(c) by Sellers if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the
Outside Date, _provided_ that Sellers are not at the time of such election
to terminate in breach in any material respect of any of their obligations
hereunder;

  



  

(d) by Sellers if there has been a breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, including, but
not limited to, those provisions relating to any financing of the purchase of
the Shares, which breach shall have had or

  



        
   

  



  

is reasonably like to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect upon Buyers or Parents ability to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (and in each case such breach is not reasonably
capable of being cured or such condition is not reasonably capable of being
satisfied within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of notice thereof
from Sellers, it being understood and agreed that this Agreement may not be
terminated pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) during such five Business Day
Period or following such five Business Day period if such breach is cured
during such five Business Day period);

  



  

(e) by Sellers or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final non-appealable
Order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions; it being agreed that the Parties hereto shall promptly appeal
any adverse determination which is appealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to a Party
if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party or Parties to
perform any of its or their obligations under this Agreement; or

  



  

(f) by Sellers or Buyer if any event shall occur after the date hereof that
shall have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the
obligations of the terminating Party or Parties to perform its or their
obligations hereunder, unless the occurrence of such event shall be due to
the failure of the terminating Party or Parties to perform or comply with any
of the agreements, covenants or conditions hereof to be performed or complied
with by such Party or Parties prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination and abandonment of this Agreement by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.1 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other Party.  If this Agreement is terminated and the Contemplated
Transactions are abandoned as provided herein:

  



  

(a) Each Party will redeliver all documents, work papers and other material
of any other Party relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the
same; _provided_ that each Party may retain one copy of all such documents
for archival purposes in the custody of its outside or in-house counsel;

  



  

(b) All confidential information received by any Party hereto with respect to
the business of any other Party or its Affiliates shall be treated in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Company and Parent, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; and

  



  

(c) All filings, applications and other submission made to any Person,
including any Governmental Authority, in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from such Person.

  



  

Section 10.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and
the Contemplated Transactions are abandoned in accordance with Section 10.1,
this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect (other
than Section 6.1, Section 7.3, Section 10.2, this Section 10.3, and Article
XI, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement

  



        
   

  



  

and be enforceable by the Parties), and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of any Party to any other Party, except for breaches
of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination and, in the case of
Buyer, any failure of Buyer or Parent to have sufficient immediately
available funds for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
Nothing in this Article X shall be deemed to impair the right of any Party to
compel specific performance by another Party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of or
a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by
any of the Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of
the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege
hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a
similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or
privileges hereunder.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Expenses. _Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any advisor
fees and expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated (a) by Veritas, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
(including, for costs incurred prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
shall be paid by Sellers, and (b) by Parent, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates (including, for costs incurred following the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) shall be paid by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
be responsible for paying the filing fee required to be paid by the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, but
not the other costs and expenses of the Sellers and their Affiliates related
thereto.

  



  

Section 11.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have
the right to assign all or certain provisions of this Agreement, or any
interest herein, and may delegate any duty or obligation hereunder, without
the consent of Sellers, (i) to any Affiliate of Buyer (unless to do so would
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
(ii) at any time after the Closing, to any purchaser of any or all of the
assets or equity interests (whether by merger,
recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of Buyer or (iii) to any of
Buyers financing sources for the Contemplated Transactions, as collateral;
_provided_ that, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii), no such
assignment or delegation shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
hereunder.

  



  

Section 11.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement will be binding upon,
inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, performed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without
giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction) as to all matters, including, but not limited to,
matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 11.8 _Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder (other than with respect to any dispute arising under
Section 2.6, which shall be governed by the procedure specified therein), or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party
hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, State of New York or the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.6 (which shall govern any dispute
arising thereunder), each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with Section 11.1, (b)
any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

  



  

Section 11.9 Waiver of Jury Trial.

  



  

(a) **EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THIS WAIVER MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY
REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 11.9(A) AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO). THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.**  The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be
filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including contract claims, tort claims,
breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. In the
event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a
trial by the court.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) **EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND
(iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.9.**

  



  

Section 11.10 _Relationship of the Parties_. The Parties agree that this is
an arms length transaction in which the Parties undertakings and
obligations are limited to the performance of their obligations under this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Buyer acknowledges that it is a sophisticated
investor and that it has only a contractual relationship with Sellers, based
solely on the terms of this Agreement, and that there is no special
relationship of trust or reliance between either Seller, on the one hand, and
Parent or Buyer, on the other hand.

  



  

Section 11.11 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. In the event that any signature to this Agreement is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a portable document format
(.pdf or similar format) data file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof. This Agreement shall become effective
when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all
of the other Parties hereto. Until and unless each Party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other Party hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

  



  

Section 11.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as otherwise provided
herein with respect to the Seller Indemnitees, the Buyer Indemnitees, and the
Covered Persons, the representations, warranties and agreements of the
Parties contained herein are intended solely for the benefit of the Party to
whom such representations, warranties or agreements are made, shall confer no
rights hereunder, whether legal or equitable, in any other Person, and no
other Person shall be entitled to rely thereon.

  



  

Section 11.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the other
Transaction Documents and the other documents and instruments referred to
herein and therein), the Confidentiality Agreement entered into by Parent and
the Company and the schedules attached hereto sets forth the entire agreement
and understanding of the Parties in respect of the Contemplated Transactions
and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements
and understandings, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. There are no warranties, representations or other
agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 11.14 _Severability. _If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.15 _Specific Performance. _Each of the Sellers, Parent and Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury to the other Party or Parties
may occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that such
injury would not be adequately compensable in damages because of the
difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damages that will be suffered in the
event that this Agreement was breached. It is accordingly agreed that
Sellers, Parent, and Buyer shall each be entitled, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to specific
enforcement of, and injunctive relief, without proof of actual damages, to
prevent any violation of, the terms hereof, and the other Party or Parties
will not take action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to the Party or
Parties seeking such relief on the grounds that any other remedy or relief is
available at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.

  



  

Section 11.16 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by independent legal counsel of its own choice
throughout all of the negotiations that preceded the execution of this
Agreement. Each Party further acknowledges that it and its counsel have had
adequate opportunity to make whatever investigation or inquiry they may deem
necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement prior to the execution hereof.

  



  

Section 11.17 _Rules of Construction, etc_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Each Schedule which is a
part of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to incorporate by reference
all information disclosed in any other Schedule which is a part of the
Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that
such disclosure applies to such other Schedule.  The disclosure of any
matter on any Schedule hereto shall not be deemed to constitute an admission
or indication by Parent, Buyer, Veritas, or a Seller, or to otherwise imply,
that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement. Nor
shall any disclosure on a Schedule be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
that any such matter is required to be disclosed.  No disclosure on any
Schedule relating to a possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. The disclosure of any matter in any
Schedule hereto is not to be treated as constituting or implying any
representation, warranty, assurance or undertaking by a Seller not expressly
set out in the Agreement, nor to be

  



        
   

  



  

treated as adding to or extending the scope of any of the representations or
warranties of a Seller in the Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.18 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of
this Agreement, and the Table of Contents are for convenience of the Parties
only, and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

  



  

Section 11.19 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, agent, attorney or representative of the
Acquired Companies, Sellers, Parent or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have be deemed to (i) have made any representations or
warranties in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, or (ii) have any
personal liability to Parent, Buyer or a Seller, as the case may be, for any
obligations or liabilities of a Seller, or Parent or Buyer, as the case may
be, under this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the Contemplated Transactions. It is further understood that any
certificate or certification contemplated by this Agreement and executed by
an officer or other representative of a Party shall be deemed to have been
delivered only in such officers or representatives capacity as an officer
or representative, as applicable, of such Party (and not in his or her
individual capacity) and shall not entitle any Party to assert a claim
against such officer or representative in his or her individual capacity.

  



  

Section 11.20 _No Set-Off_. The obligation of Buyer to pay to Sellers the
Purchase Price and any other payments hereunder, or under any agreements
entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not be subject to any right of set-off against any of Sellers respective
obligations whatsoever, and each of Parent and Buyer hereby irrevocably
waives any and all such rights.

  



  

Section 11.21 _Inconsistencies with Other Agreements_. In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and those
in the other Transaction Documents referred to herein, the provisions in the
body of this Agreement will prevail and govern.

  



  

Section 11.22 _Obligations of Sellers and Buyer_. Whenever this Agreement
requires an Acquired Company which is a Subsidiary of a Seller to take any
action, that requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of such Seller to cause that Acquired Company to take that action.
 Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent or Buyer to
take any action, that requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent or Buyer to cause that Subsidiary of Parent or Buyer,
as the case may be, to take that action.

  



  

Section 11.23 _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a) An item arising with respect to a specific representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth in" a balance sheet or
financial statements, to the extent any such phrase appears in such
representation or warranty, if (a) there is a reserve, accrual or other
similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial
statements that related to the subject matter of such representation, (b)
such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or
financial statements or (c) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or
financial statements and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto.

other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible

thereof.  The disclosure of the name of, or any party to, a Contract, or the
terms or conditions of a Contract, in any Schedule is subject to the
restrictions set forth in such Contract or under applicable Law with respect
to such disclosure, and no representations or warranties of a Seller in
Article III shall be deemed to be untrue or inaccurate by reason of the
disclosure in a Schedule being omitted or otherwise limited in order to
comply with such restrictions.

  



  

(k) References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of
that Person.

  



  

(l) The word "day", unless otherwise indicated, shall be deemed to refer to a
calendar day. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise
specified, from and including or through and including, respectively.

Parties agree that there are no third party beneficiaries to this guarantee
