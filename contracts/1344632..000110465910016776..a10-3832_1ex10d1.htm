 **(v) _minus_** , on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount if any by which
the Working Capital is less than $5,000,000.00 (the " ** _Working Capital
Baseline_** "). There shall be no increase in the Merger Consideration if the
Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital

  



        
   

  



  

Baseline. For example, (A) if the Working Capital is $2,000,000, the Merger
Consideration will be reduced by $3,000,000, (B) if the Working Capital is
($1,000,000), the Merger Consideration will be reduced by $6,000,000, and (C)
if the Working Capital is $6,000,000 there will be no adjustment to the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.6(v).

  



  

 **1.7 Escrow**.  Of the Merger Consideration, ten percent (10%) of the
Enterprise Value (the " ** _Escrow Amount_** ") shall be deposited by Parent
at the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into escrow

Period_** ") for the purpose of satisfying indemnification claims pursuant to
Section 9 hereof and for purposes of Section 1.9(e)(ii).  Each Escrow
Participant shall contribute to the Escrow Amount in proportion to such
Escrow Participants Pro Rata Share (relative to the total Pro Rata Shares of
all Escrow Participants) and in the amount set forth on the Payout
Spreadsheet (such amount, as to each Escrow Participant, is
sometimes referred to herein as the " ** _Escrow Contribution_** "). Upon the
expiration of the Escrow Period (or on such later date as is specified in the
Escrow Agreement), the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, if any, shall
be distributed to the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of each Escrow
Participant based on their respective Escrow Contributions, all in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For each Effective Time Holder (other
than the Escrow Participants), such Effective Time Holders Escrow
Contribution shall be zero (0).

  



  

 **1.8 Calculation and Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration**.

  



  

 **(a) Estimated Statement**. Not less than two (2) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Parent a reasonably detailed statement (the " ** _Estimated Statement_**
") containing (i) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
the amount of the Company Debt based on payoff letters received from the
lenders, and good faith estimates of Company Transaction Expenses, Closing
Cash and Working Capital, and (iii) the Companys calculation of the
Merger Consideration (based on the amount of the Company Debt and the
Companys good faith estimates of the Company Transaction Expenses, Closing
Cash and Working Capital) pursuant to Section 1.6(b) (the " **
_Estimated Merger Consideration_** ").  The Estimated Statement shall be
based upon the books and records of the Company Group and other information
then available and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 **(i) **Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Company Debt by

lenders;

purpose of satisfying indemnification claims pursuant to Section 9 and for
purposes of Section 1.9(e)(ii);

  



  

 **(iv) **Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Fleischer
Severance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account

 **1.9 Calculation and Payment of Final Purchase Price**.

  



  

 **(a) **Within sixty (60) days following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Agent its final
determination of the Merger Consideration, including statements of the
Company Debt, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash and Working Capital
(as revised or adjusted pursuant to Section 1.9(d), each, a " ** _Final
Statement_** " and collectively, the " ** _Final Statements_** "),
including such schedules and data as may be appropriate to support
such calculations. Upon receiving reasonable advance written notice, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide the Stockholders Agent with full access
to the applicable Records, employees and accountants of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries related to its review of the Final

materials relating to the Final Statements prepared by or on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation to the extent reasonably requested by the Stockholders
Agent during the dispute resolution periods described in this Section 1.9.

  



  

 **(b) **If the Stockholders Agent objects to the Surviving Corporations
determination of the Company Debt, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash
or Working Capital, **** as reflected in the Final Statements, the
Stockholders Agent shall notify the Surviving Corporation in writing of such
objection(s) within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final Statements
from the Surviving Corporation (an " ** _Objection Notice_** "). The Objection
Notice shall specify which Final Statement(s) are being disputed and describe
in reasonable detail the basis for such disputes.

  



  

 **(c) **If the Stockholders Agent does not deliver an Objection Notice,
then the Final Statements will be conclusive, final and binding in their
entirety on all of the parties. If the Stockholders Agent delivers
an Objection Notice with respect to one or more Final Statements in

subject to the Objection Notice shall be conclusive, final and binding with
respect to those items that are not objected to by the Stockholders Agent in
the Objection Notice, (ii) the Stockholders Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall attempt to resolve such disputed items, and (iii)

any such disputes, the items set forth in the Objection Notice shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.9(d) below.

  



  

 **(d) **In the event that the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders
Agent are unable to resolve the disputed items within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the Objection Notice, either the Surviving Corporation or
the Stockholders Agent may demand that such disputed items be referred to an
independent accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholders Agent to finally resolve such disputed
items. The independent accounting firm shall act as an arbitrator to
determine only the disputed items, and the determination of each disputed
item shall be within the range established by the Final Statements and the
Objection Notice, if any. The determination of such independent accounting
firm shall be made as promptly as possible and shall be final and binding
upon the parties. Each party hereto shall be permitted to submit such data
and information to such independent accounting firm as the parties deem
appropriate. The Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Agent, on behalf
of the Effective  Time Holders, shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred under this Section 1.9(d). All expenses and fees incurred in
connection with the independent accounting firm shall be paid equally by the
Surviving Corporation on one hand and the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders, on the other hand.

  



  

 **(e) **The Company Debt, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash and
Working Capital as determined in accordance with this Section 1.9 shall be
used to determine the final Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.6(b) (the " ** _Final Merger Consideration_** ").  Once the Final Merger
Consideration is determined in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and this
Section 1.9, the following shall occur:

  



  

 **(i) **if the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration, the Stockholders Agent shall deliver to Parent in writing the
Stockholders Agents determination of the portion of such difference payable
to each Effective Time Holder pursuant to the Company Charter with respect to
the shares of Company Capital Stock owned of record by such Effective Time
Holder, and the Parent shall pay each Effective Time Holder entitled to
receive a portion of such difference, within three (3) business days
following delivery of such written notice, the amount set forth in
such notice (provided that the aggregate amount payable to all Effective
Time Holders pursuant to this Section 1.9(e)(i) shall not exceed
the difference between the Final Merger Consideration and the Estimated
Merger Consideration), by check or wire transfer to such Effective Time
Holder; or

  



  

 **(ii) **if the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, the Escrow Agent shall pay or cause to be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in
writing by Parent from the Escrow Amount, within three (3) business days
following delivery of such written notice, the amount set forth in
such notice (provided that the aggregate amount payable to Parent shall not
be less than the difference between the Estimated Merger Consideration and
the Final Merger Consideration); and

  



  

 **(iii) **the Stockholders Agent shall revise the Payout Spreadsheet to
reflect any changes to the amounts reflected thereon resulting from changes
in the Final Merger

  



        
   

  



  

Consideration (as compared to the Estimated Merger Consideration), and shall
provide such revised Payout Spreadsheet to Parent promptly (but in any event
within three (3) business days) following the determination of the Final
Merger Consideration.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event will the aggregate amount payable to the Effective Time Holders exceed
the Final Merger Consideration.

 **(iv) **each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

The amount of cash, if any, that each stockholder of the Company is entitled
to receive for the shares of Company Capital Stock held by such stockholder
shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and
computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all shares of each
class and series of Company Capital Stock held by such stockholder.

  



  

 **(b) Adjustments**. In the event that the Company, at any time or from time
to time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares
or pays any dividend on Company Capital Stock payable in Company Capital
Stock or in any right to acquire Company Capital Stock, or effects
a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock into a
greater number of shares of Company Capital Stock, or in the event the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares of Company Capital Stock, then the amounts payable in respect of
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.10(a) shall be
appropriately adjusted.

  



         
 

  



  

 **1.11 Stock Options**.

  



  

 **(a) Payment for Payout Options**. At the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Payout Option shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, as part of the Merger Consideration,
for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Payout Option, an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Payout Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the amount by
which the Common Stock Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise
price of such Payout Option. The cancellation of the Payout Options as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of
any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such
Payout Option. The aggregate amount paid or payable in respect of the
cancellation of the Payout Options as set forth in this Section 1.11(a)
is referred to herein as the " ** _Option Consideration_**."

  



  

 **(b) **Termination of the Company Option Plan****. The Company Option Plan
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the Company Capital Stock (or any capital stock of any
Subsidiary of the Company) shall be canceled as of the Effective Time.
The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in
the Company Option Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

  



  

 **(c) Option Plan Notices**. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to the holders of Payout Options notices, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

 **(d) Other Actions**. The Company shall take all actions that may be
necessary or that Parent considers appropriate (under the Company Option Plan
or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.11 and to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Payout Options have no
rights with respect to such Payout Options except as set forth in Section
1.11(a).

  



  

 **1.12 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books.** At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of the Company Capital Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of the Company Capital Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any of such shares of the Company
Capital Stock (a " ** _Company Stock Certificate_** ") is presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.13.

  



  

 **1.13 Surrender and Payment**. At or as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent will send to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates (other than the Closing Date

  



        
   

  



  

Payees): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for payment
of the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration relating thereto. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to Parent for exchange, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by Parent, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment of an amount equal
to the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration for the class of Company
Capital Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate multiplied by the
number of shares represented by such Company Stock Certificate, and the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.13, each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration applicable thereto. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit
and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

  



  

 **1.14 Withholding Rights**. Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Effective Time Holder an amount not in excess of the amount it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such
consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
or other Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by or
on behalf of Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Effective Time Holders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

 **1.15 Dissenting Shares**.

  



  

 **(a) **Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who shall
have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive
payment from the Company of the appraised value of such shares of Company
Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL.

  



  

 **(b) **Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.15(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his or her appraisal rights, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock to
which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under Section
1.10, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.

  



        
   

  



  

 **(c) **Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company (i) is required by applicable Legal
Requirements to make any per share payment or payments in respect of
Dissenting Shares in excess of the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such share under this
Agreement; or (ii) reasonably incurs any other costs or expenses (including
specifically, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
expenses in connection with any Legal Proceeding commenced by a holder of
Dissenting Shares) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (together, the " **
_Dissenting Share Payments_** "), Parent shall be entitled to recover under
the terms of Section 9 hereof the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments.

  



  

 **1.16 Further Action.** If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

  



  

 **SECTION 2.** **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE
PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS.**

 **2.1 Existence and Power**. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements
of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
the Company Charter, its bylaws and its other organizational documents as
currently in effect.

  



  

 **2.2 Corporate Authorization**.

  



  

 **(a) **The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this

the Company.  This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its

Effect. The Company has made available a true and correct copy of each such
Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable or

Notice alleging, with reasonable specificity, the existence of an inaccuracy
in or a breach of a Specified Representation and asserting a Claim for
recovery under Section 9.3 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach or a
Claim for indemnification under Sections 9.3(c), 9.3(d) or 9.3(e) of this
Agreement, then the Claim asserted in such Claim Notice shall survive the

result of: (a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the
Company and the Principal Stockholders contained in Section 2; (b) the
failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Principal

 **9.4 Indemnification of the Stockholder Indemnitees**. Subject to the terms
contained in this Section 9, Parent will indemnify the Stockholder
Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any Damages incurred by any of
them, arising out of or as a result of: (a) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained in Section 3;
or (b) the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform any of their covenants
or agreements contained herein. The Stockholder Indemnitees (other than the
Principal Stockholders) are intended third party beneficiaries of this
Section 9.4, and the Stockholders Agent shall have the right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 9.4 on behalf of the Stockholder Indemnitees.

  



  

 **9.5 Procedure Relative to Indemnification**.

  



  

 **(a) **In the event that any party hereto shall claim that it is entitled
to be indemnified, defended or held harmless pursuant to the terms of this
Section 9 (each, a " ** _Claim_** "), such party (the " ** _Claiming Party_**
") shall promptly notify the party or parties against which the claim is made
(the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") in writing (a " ** _Claim Notice_** ") of
such Claim promptly after the Claiming Party becomes aware of the Claim or
receives notice of any action, Legal Proceeding, demand or assessment or
otherwise has received notice of any claim of a third party (a " ** _Third-
Party Claim_** ") that may reasonably be expected to result in a Claim by the
Claiming Party against the Indemnifying Party. The Claim Notice shall
specify the breach of representation, warranty, agreement or covenant claimed
by the Claiming Party and the Damages incurred by, or imposed upon, the
Claiming Party on account thereof.  If such Damages are liquidated in amount,
the Claim Notice shall so state and such amount shall be deemed the amount of
the Claim of the Claiming Party. If the amount is not liquidated, the Claim
Notice shall so state and in such event a Claim shall be deemed asserted
against the Indemnifying Party on behalf of the Claiming Party, but
no payment shall be made on account thereof until the amount of such Claim
is liquidated and the Claim is finally determined.

  



  

 **(b) **The following provisions shall apply to Claims of the Claiming Party
which are based upon a Third-Party Claim (including any form of Legal
Proceeding filed or instituted by any Governmental Body):

  



  

 **(i) **The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon receipt of the
Claim Notice and at its expense, to defend such Third-Party Claim in its own
name or, if necessary, in the name of the Claiming Party. The Claiming Party
shall cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such
assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested of the Claiming
Party, and the Claiming Party shall have the right, at the Claiming

  



        
   

  



  

Partys expense, to participate in the defense. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to settle and compromise such Third-Party Claim only with the
consent of the Claiming Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no
effect on any other Claims that may be made against the Claiming Party and
the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Claiming Party fails to consent to any settlement
or compromise offer, the Indemnifying Party may continue to contest such
Third-Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Party to the Claiming Party such Claim shall not exceed such
settlement or compromise offer.

  



  

 **(ii) **Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall also have the right, within
thirty (30) days from receipt of the Claim Notice, to notify the Claiming
Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the merits of the Third-Party
Claim or that the Third-Party Claim is the subject of indemnification
hereunder. Such dispute shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys right to
defend the Third-Party Claim under Section 9.5(b)(i).

  



  

 **(iii) **In the event the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Claiming
Party that the Indemnifying Party does not wish to defend the Third-Party
Claim, then the Claiming Party shall have the right to conduct a defense
against such Third-Party Claim and shall have the right to settle
and compromise such Third-Party Claim if it acts reasonably and in good faith
upon ten (10) days notice to, but without having to first obtain the
consent of, the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

 **(c) **Upon receipt of a Claim Notice that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of
such Claim Notice to notify the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party
disputes such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely notify the
Claiming Party of such dispute, then the amount of such Claim shall be
deemed, conclusively, a Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If
the Indemnifying Party does timely notify the Claiming Party of such dispute,
then the Claiming Party shall have thirty (30) days to respond in a
written statement to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such
thirty (30)-day period there remains a dispute as to any such Claim, then the
Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith for a
period not to exceed thirty (30) additional days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to such Claim. If the parties should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by the Parent and the Stockholders Agent. If the parties do not agree within
such additional thirty (30)-day period, then the Claiming Party may pursue
any and all other remedies available to it hereunder.  With respect to any
Claim Notice relating to a breach of the representation and warranty
contained in the last sentence of Section 2.15(h) or Section 2.15(j), the
Claiming Party shall promptly notify the Stockholders Agent after it becomes
of aware of such Claim and shall keep the Stockholders Agent reasonably
informed of any remediation actions to be taken by the Claiming Party with
respect thereto.

  



  

 **(d) **In the event it is determined, or the Claiming Party agrees, that
the Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify the Claiming Party for
such Claim, the Claiming Party agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees,
including reasonable attorneys fees,

  



        
   

  



  

which may have been incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending or
disputing the Claim by the Claiming Party under this Section 9.

  



  

 **(e) **In the event any Parent Indemnitee receives any oral or written
communication regarding any pending or threatened examination, claim,
adjustment or other Legal Proceeding with respect to the Liability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Companys Subsidiaries for Taxes
for which the Effective Time Holders are or may be liable under this
Agreement by reason of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in Section 2.12 or otherwise (a " ** _Tax Claim_** "), the
Surviving Corporation shall, within ten days, notify the Stockholders Agent
in writing thereof, and the Effective Time Holders, through the Stockholders
Agent, shall be entitled, at their sole expense, to control or settle the
contest of, any examination, claim, adjustment or Legal Proceeding that could
give rise to such Liability; _provided, however_ , that the Effective Time
Holders shall not take or advocate any position that could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation or
any of the Company Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Surviving Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Effective Time Holders through the Stockholders Agent shall
keep the Surviving Corporation fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Proceeding. The Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully with the
Stockholders Agent in handling any such Tax Claim. The Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided to the Stockholders Agent
or its designee, all necessary authorizations, including powers of attorney,
to control any such Tax Proceeding which the Effective Time Holders are
entitled to control in connection with this Section 9.5(e). Notwithstanding
anything contained in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, if any such
Tax Proceeding relating to a Tax Claim results in the payment of any Taxes
for which the Effective Time Holders are liable hereunder, the amount of the
Taxes for which the Effective Time Holders are liable shall be net of any Tax
benefit realized or reasonably expected to be realized by the Surviving
Corporation, the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
as a result of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Liability (also
taking into account any Tax detriment realized by the receipt of such
indemnification payment) of the Effective Time Holders for such Taxes.

  



  

 **(f) **For purposes of this Section 9, the Stockholders Agent shall act on
behalf of the Stockholder Indemnitees.

  



  

 **(g) **The parties hereby agree that, unless otherwise required by a final
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, all
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for
income tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

 **9.6 Limits on Indemnification**.

  



  

 **(a) Basket**.  Neither the Escrow Participants nor the Company shall be
obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Parent Indemnitee with
respect to any Damages from any Claim or Claims made by a Parent Indemnitee
pursuant to Sections 9.3(a) or 9.3(b) of this Agreement, except to the
extent that the aggregate Damages from all Claims exceed one-half percent
(0.5%) of the Enterprise Value (the " ** _Basket Amount_** "), at which
point the Escrow Participants will only be obligated to indemnify the Parent
Indemnitees from and

  



        
   

  



  

against all Damages above the Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.6(a) shall not apply (i) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Specified Representations or (ii) to inaccuracies in
or breaches of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section
2.18 of this Agreement relating to the Companys 401(k) Plan or any
predecessor thereto.

  



  

 **(b) Escrow as Cap**.  In no event shall (i) the Escrow Participants
aggregate liability for Damages pursuant to Sections 9.3(a) or 9.3(b) exceed,
in the aggregate, the Escrow Amount, or (ii) any individual Escrow
Participants liability for Damages pursuant to Sections 9.3(a) or 9.3(b)
exceed, in the aggregate, such Escrow Participants Escrow Contribution;
_provided, however_ , that the limitations set forth in this Section 9.6(b)
shall not apply to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
Specified Representations or as otherwise provided in Section 9.6(c).

  



  

 **(c) Liability Cap Applicable to the Specified Representations and other
Matters**. In no event shall: (i) Russell Fleischer have any liability for
indemnification with respect to Section 9.3(c), 9.3(d) or 9.3(e) or resulting
from an inaccuracy or breach of the Specified Representations, in excess of
his Escrow Contribution (and, with respect thereto, the Escrow Amount shall
constitute the exclusive remedy), or (ii) any individual Principal
Stockholders liability for Damages pursuant to Sections 9.3(c), 9.3(d) or
9.3(e) or resulting from an inaccuracy or breach of the Specified
Representations exceed, in the aggregate, such Principal Stockholders Pro
Rata Share of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

 **(d) Cut-Off Date**.  Any Claim made under Sections 9.3(a) or 9.3(b) and
9.4(a) or 9.4(b) of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in Section
9.2, not submitted in writing to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the Cut-Off Date shall be deemed to have been waived and shall
be absolutely and forever barred and unenforceable, null and void, and of no
force or effect whatsoever and the indemnifying party shall have no further
liability with respect thereto.

  



  

 **(e) Treatment of Insurance and Tax Benefits**. With respect to each Claim,
the Claiming Party (or in the case of a Claim by any Parent Indemnitee after
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assert all claims under all applicable
insurance policies, and any Damages that may be recovered by the Claiming
Party with respect to such Claim shall be net of any insurance proceeds
received with respect thereto (net of the present value of any increases in
premiums). To the extent that insurance proceeds are collected after a Claim
has been settled, the Claiming Party shall restore the Indemnifying Party to
the same economic position as would have existed had such insurance proceeds
been collected prior to the settlement of such Claim. In addition, the Damages
that may be recovered by a Claiming Party shall be net of any Tax benefit as
a result of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Liability of the
Indemnifying Party, but solely to the extent of any Tax benefit actually
received (if and when received and treating any such benefit as the last item
of deduction for the applicable Tax year) and taking into account any Tax
detriment to the Claiming Party from the indemnification payments (taking
into account Section 9.5(g) below).

  



         
 

  



  

 **(f) Right of Subrogation**.  If any of the Damages for which an
Indemnifying Party is responsible or allegedly responsible under this Section
9 are recoverable or reasonably likely to be recoverable against any third
party at the time that payment is due hereunder, the Claiming Party shall
assign any and all rights that it may have to recover such Damages to the
Indemnifying Party or, if such rights are not assignable for any reason, the
Claiming Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any and
all such Damages on account thereof from such third party for the benefit of
the Indemnifying Party. The Claiming Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any and all Damages paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Claiming
Party pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such amount is subsequently
paid to the Claiming Party by any Person other than the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

 **(g) No Duplication of Recovery**.  Notwithstanding anything contained in
the Transaction Documents to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any Damages
resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company under Section 2 is taken into account as a current
liability, reserved or accrued, or otherwise accounted for, in determining
Working Capital, (A) no Parent Indemnitee may recover such Damages through a
Claim pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise and (B) such Damages shall not be
included in the determination of whether all Damages, in the aggregate,
exceed the Basket Amount, and (ii) no Parent Indemnitee may recover
duplicative Damages from the Escrow Participants (including the Principal
Stockholders) in respect of a single set of facts or circumstances under more
than one representation or warranty in the Transaction Documents regardless
of whether such facts or circumstances would give rise to a breach of more
than one representation or warranty in this Agreement.

  



  

 **(h) Disclaimer** **of Certain Damages. **Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, no Person shall be
liable to any other Person under this Agreement or any Transaction Documents
for any exemplary or punitive damages of such other Person or for any
consequential damages of such Person to the extent such consequential damages
are not reasonably foreseeable, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), strict liability or otherwise; provided, however, that for
purposes of this sentence any damages awarded or claimed on account of a
third party claim will be deemed to be actual Damages even if constituting
any of the foregoing. Each party hereby expressly releases the other parties
and their respective representatives from all such Damages as described in
the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

 **9.7 Exclusive Remedies**.  If the Merger has been consummated, then from
and after the Effective Time, the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders Agent and the Escrow Participants in
respect of any and all Claims (other than statutory, equitable or common law
rights or remedies, in each case, for fraud or intentional misrepresentation)
arising out of or relating to the Merger and the Transactions (a " **
_Covered Matter_** ") (irrespective of the cause of action, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise) will be to make an indemnification claim
pursuant to this Section 9. If the Merger has been consummated, no Covered
Matter will give rise to any right of any party hereto to rescind this
Agreement or any of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall any of the Parent Indemnitees be deemed to have waived any
statutory, equitable or common law rights or remedies for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

  



        
   

  



  

 **9.8 Escrow As First Source of Recovery. **Any indemnification to which
Parent Indemnitees are entitled under this Agreement as a result of Damages
they may suffer shall be deducted, first, by the Parent Indemnitees from the
Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement; and, accordingly, the Escrow Amount shall be the
first source of recovery for such Damages. No **** Principal Stockholder
shall be liable for Damages directly, until such time as the Escrow Amount
has been reduced to zero in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the entire amount of the Escrow Amount shall be available to
the Parent Indemnitees on a joint and several basis for satisfaction of any
Damages they may suffer, regardless of whether or not such Damages were
caused by a particular Escrow Participant, and irrespective of whether Claims
were first asserted by the Parent Indemnitees against one or more of the
Escrow Participants. Subject to Sections 9.6(e) and 9.6(f), none of the
Escrow Participants may recover from the Parent Indemnitees, and none of the
Parent Indemnitees has any Liability for, any amount by which the Escrow
Amount is reduced thereby.

  



  

 **9.9 No Recovery**.  No Principal Stockholder will be entitled to make any
Claim for indemnification against Parent, the Merger Sub or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation by reason of the fact that such
Principal Stockholder was a controlling Person, director, employee or
representative of the Company or was serving as such for another Person at
the request of Parent or the Company (whether such Claim is for Damages of
any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute,
governing documents, contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any
Claim for which a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification from a
Principal Stockholder under this Agreement.

  



  

 **9.10 Determination of Damages**.  For purposes of this Section 9 and for
calculating Damages resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty (but not for the purpose of determining the existence of such
breach or inaccuracy), all qualifications as to "materiality" and "Material
Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded and without effect (as if such standard
or qualification were deleted from such representation, warranty or
covenant).

  



  

 **SECTION 10.** TAX MATTERS.

  



  

 **10.1 Tax Indemnification**.  The Principal Stockholders shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Parent Indemnitees from and against, any Damages
attributable to (a) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" ** _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_** "), (b) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Legal Requirements, and (c)
any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a), (b), and (c)
above, the Principal Stockholders shall be liable only to the extent that
such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes (excluding any

  



        
   

  



  

reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) included in the computation of the Working Capital for
purposes of Section 1 of this Agreement, and provided further that Parent
shall not be entitled to a duplicate recovery for any amount indemnifiable
pursuant to this Section 10. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
obligations of the Principal Stockholders under this Section 10.1 shall not
be limited by any language or limitations contained in the representation on
Taxes found in Section 2.12. The procedures set forth in Section 9.5 shall
apply with respect to any claim by Parent for Tax indemnification under this
Section 10.1. Any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are the
responsibility of the Principal Stockholders pursuant to this Section 10.1
constitute Damages giving rise to a Claim that the Parent Indemnitees may
assert against the Stockholder Indemnitees in accordance with Section 9 of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, all available net operating loss
and net capital loss carryforwards attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be applied when determining (i) Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and (ii) any
indemnification obligation under this Agreement in the event of a breach of a
representation set forth in Section 2.12 of this Agreement.

  



  

 **10.2 Straddle Period and Other Allocations**.  In the case of any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle
Period_** "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of
any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at
such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt, all employer
Taxes attributable to payments of compensation to employees and
former employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time, and all employer Taxes attributable to Option Consideration, shall be
the responsibility of Parent and shall not be subject to indemnification
or reimbursement under this Section 10 or any other provision of
this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall be responsible for such
employer Taxes only to the extent the employer Taxes are attributable to
such compensation and Option Consideration that is paid after the Closing
Date or, if paid on the Closing Date, is deductible after the Closing Date.
The parties agree that the payment of compensation (including Option
Consideration) to employees or former employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date but after the Effective Time shall be
properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, so that, in accordance with Treasury
Regulation 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), such payment shall be treated for all
Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date.

  



  

 **10.3 ******Cooperation.**** The parties hereto shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
the preparation of Tax Returns, the payment of Taxes, the resolution of Tax
audits and Tax deficiencies, and effectuating the terms of this Agreement,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection therewith. Parent shall retain the Records of

of the Agreement.  The Stockholders Agent shall retain all Records in its
possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
for at least seven (7) years following the Closing.

  



  

 **SECTION 11.** MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

  



  

 **11.1 Stockholders Agent**.

  



  

 **(a) Appointment**.  By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement pursuant
to the Stockholder Written Consent or such other agreements and documents, as
applicable, the Effective Time Holders irrevocably nominate, constitute and
appoint the Stockholders Agent as the agent and true and lawful attorney-in-
fact of the Effective Time Holders, with full power of substitution, to act
in the name, place and stead of the Effective Time Holders for purposes of
executing any documents and taking any actions that the Stockholders Agent
may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9 or under the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

 **(b) Authority**.  The Effective Time Holders grant to the Stockholders
Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders (in the name of any or all of the
Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the
Stockholders Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the
Stockholders Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate,
in performing his duties as contemplated by Section 11.1(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other
agreement executed in connection with the Transactions: (i) each Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders Agent
on all matters relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9 or under the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each
Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Stockholders Agent,
and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any
Effective Time Holder by the Stockholders Agent, as fully binding upon such
Effective Time Holder.

  



  

 **(c) Power of Attorney**.  The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend
that the power of attorney granted in Section 11.1(a): (i) is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Stockholders
Agent (provided that such delegation is reasonably acceptable to Parent); and
(iii) shall survive the death or incapacity of any Effective Time Holder.

  



  

 **(d) Replacement**.  If the Stockholders Agent shall dissolve or otherwise
be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Effective Time
Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a majority of
the Merger Consideration), within 30 days after such dissolution, appoint a
successor to the Stockholders Agent (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) and immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such
successor. Any such successor shall succeed the Stockholders Agent as the
"Stockholders Agent"

  



        
   

  



  

hereunder. If for any reason there is no Stockholders Agent at any time, all
references herein to the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the
Effective Time Holders.

  



  

 **(e) Stockholders Agent Retention Account**. The Company and the
Stockholders Agent will, at least two days prior to the Closing Date,
direct, by joint written notice(s) to Parent, that on the Closing Date a
portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Escrow
Participants, in an amount equal to $25,000, shall be withheld and paid
directly by Parent to the Stockholders Agent as designated in such notice,
as a fund for the fees and expenses of the Stockholders Agent incurred in
connection with this Agreement (the " ** _Stockholders  Agent Retention
Account_**"), with any balance of the Stockholders Agent Retention Account
not used for such purposes to be paid by the Stockholders Agent to the
Effective Time Holders in accordance with their respective Escrow
Contributions.

  



  

 **(f) Exculpation**.  The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any
Effective Time Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders
Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Effective Time Holders shall
jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.

  



  

 **11.2 Fees and Expenses.**  Each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay
all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that
have been incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
Transactions, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party
in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the investigation and review
conducted by Parent and its Representatives with respect to the Companys
business (and the furnishing of information to Parent and its Representatives
in connection with such investigation and review); (b) the negotiation,
preparation and review of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule)
and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other instruments and
documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the Transactions,
(c) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be
made or given in connection with any of the Transactions, and the obtaining
of any consent required to be obtained in connection with any of such
transactions; and (d) the consummation of the Merger. In the case of the
Company, all Company Transaction Expenses shall be deducted from the amount
otherwise payable as the Merger Consideration under this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.3 Notices.** Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile) to
the address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the name of such

with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of
Delaware (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

  



  

 **11.8 Successors and Assigns.**  This Agreement shall be binding upon: the
Company and its successors and assigns (if any); Parent and its successors
and assigns (if any); Merger Sub

Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties, the Indemnitees and the
respective successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing. No party may
assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other parties,
except that Parent may, without the consent of any other party, (a) assign
any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its

hereunder) to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of the

case, that no such assignment, transfer or delegation will relieve Parent of
its obligations hereunder). Such successor or assignee will have all rights
of Parent under this Agreement, including the right to enforce the covenants
contained in this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.9 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance.**  The rights and remedies

Agreement, such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it) to: (a) a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision; and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach.

  



  

 **11.10 Amendments and Waivers**.

the Principal Stockholders; and (ii) if the Closing occurs, at any time after
the consummation of the Closing, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed by Parent, the Principal Stockholders and the Stockholders Agent
(it being acknowledged and agreed that, after the Closing, the Stockholders

Time Holders, all as contemplated by Section 11.1).

  



  

 **(b) **No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

 **11.11 Severability.** Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the

  



        
   

  



  

term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise
the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  



  

 **11.12 Parties in Interest.**  Except for the provisions of Sections 1.11,
6.3 and Section 9, none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to
provide any rights or remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns (if any).

  



  

 **11.13 Construction**.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include the masculine and feminine genders.

  



  

 **(b) **The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect
that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

 **(c) **As used in this Agreement, the words " ** _include_** " and " **
_including_** ," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

United States dollars.

  



  

 **(e) **Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "

of this Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.14 Entire Agreement.**  This Agreement and the other agreements
referred to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings among or between any of the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement executed on behalf of Parent on June 26, 2009
and the Company on June 18, 2009 (the " ** _Existing NDA_** ") shall not be
superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms until the earlier of: (a) the Effective Time; or (b) the date on
which such Existing NDA is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 **FORM OF FLEISCHER RELEASE**

  



  

 ** _SEPARATION AGREEMENT, WAIVER, AND RELEASE_**

  



  

This Separation Agreement, Waiver, and Release ("Agreement") is made and
entered into the day of January, 2010 by and among Russell Fleischer
("Employee"); Quovadx Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"); and Lawson Software
Americas, Inc. ("Lawson").

  



  

WHEREAS, Employee has been employed with the Company as its CEO pursuant to a
letter agreement dated June 4, 2007 (the "Offer Letter");

  



  

WHEREAS, Lawson acquired the Company by means of reverse triangular merger
(the "Merger") effective as of the date hereof, pursuant to the terms of that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 7, 2010 (the "Merger
Agreement") by and among Lawson, the Company and the other parties thereto
(capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement);

  



  

WHEREAS, Lawson has informed the Employee that it is unable to identify a
position for him within Lawson after the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, effective as of the date hereof, Employees employment and position
as an officer with the Company has terminated;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, the Company has agreed to
provide certain severance benefits to Employee (in lieu of the payment of any
amounts or other benefits pursuant to the Offer Letter); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in consideration of this Agreement, and subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, Employee has agreed to provide the Company and Lawson with
a full release of any and all claims that Employee has or may have
against the Company, Lawson, and any of their predecessors, affiliates,
successors and assigns, in return for providing the benefits set forth in
this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants established in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **I.** ** ****SEVERANCE BENEFITS**.

  



  

The Company agrees to pay the following amounts to Employee, subject to the
rescission provisions of Section X:

  



  

 **A**. The Company will pay to Employee the sum of $275,000, less applicable
payroll deductions, and this sum shall be payable on the next business day
following the expiration of the 7-day rescission period as described in
Section X, in consideration of the release set forth in Section II(A) below.

  



  

 **B**. The Company will pay to Employee the sum of $50,000, less applicable
payroll deductions, and this sum shall be payable on the next business day
following the expiration of the 7-day rescission period as described in
Section X, in consideration of the release set forth in Section II(B).

  



  

 **C**. The Company will pay to Employee the sum of $20,000, less applicable
payroll deductions, representing the cash value of one (1) year of benefits
continuation for Employee in consideration of the release set forth in
Section II(A). **** Employee understands that he shall receive no other
benefits and shall no longer participate in the Companys benefit
plans except as provided in the terms and provisions of such plans and
further subject to any legal requirements requiring election to continue
coverage (as in the case of group health plans) as allowed by state and
federal benefits continuation laws. All of Employees rights under such
plans shall be governed in

        
   

  



  

accordance with the terms of such plans. Employee acknowledges receipt of
applicable summary plan descriptions relating to such plans. Employee is
responsible for making all premium payments or other payment charges for
continuation of such benefits. (The amounts set forth in Sections I(A), I(B)
and I(C) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Severance Benefits".)

  



  

 **D**. Employee also understands that Employee will receive the Severance
Benefits set forth above only if Employee signs this Agreement and does not
rescind it within the seven (7) day rescission period provided for in Section
X.  If, however, this Agreement is rescinded, then the Offer Letter
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be superseded by
this Agreement. Employee represents that Employee is not a party to a
pending personal bankruptcy, and that Employee is legally able and entitled
to receive the money being paid to Employee by the Company.

  



  

 **E**. On the date hereof, the Company agrees to pay the following amounts
to Employee:

  



  

 **1**. ** ****Accrued Base Salary**. **** The Company will pay to Employee
the sum of [$ ], less applicable payroll deductions, representing
Employees accrued (but unpaid) base salary for the period from [Last Payroll
Date] through the Closing Date.

  



  

 **2**. ** ****Vacation**.  The Company will pay to Employee all earned but
unused vacation through the Employees last day of employment.

  



  

 **3**. ** ****Business Expense Reimbursement**.  Prior the Closing Date,
Employee has submitted all requests for reimbursements of business expenses
and has received reimbursements for all such expenses.

  



  

 **4**. ** ****Bonus**. ** **The Company will pay to Employee the sum of
$150,000, less applicable payroll deductions, representing any and all
bonuses to Employee.

  



  

 **F**. ** ****No Other Payments**. ** **Employee acknowledges that,
upon payment of the Severance Benefits and the amounts pursuant to Section
I(E), the Company will have paid him his full salary and any bonus or other
benefit earned by him through his last day of employment.

  



  

 **II**. ** ****RELEASE OF CLAIMS**.

  



  

 **A**. ** **In return for the benefits listed in Sections I(A) and I(C)
above, subject to rescision provisions of Section X, Employee, on behalf of

unknown, asserted and unasserted, direct and indirect, and of any kind,
nature, or description whatsoever, under any local, state, or federal law(s),
or the common law of the State of Texas, arising or which may have arisen at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement.  This release includes, but is

 This release also includes any claims for attorneys fees that Employee has
or may have had for any claim identified above. Employee acknowledges that the
severance benefits set forth in Sections I(A) and I(C) above
constitute adequate consideration for this release.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee does not hereby release any claims
for workers compensation (except for claims of retaliation which
are released) or unemployment compensation benefits or other claims that
cannot by law be released. In addition, any 401(k) retirement benefits,
retirement, pension or other benefits that have accrued to Employee and
vested under the Companys plans, are not released and will be paid
or otherwise handled in accordance with the terms of such plan (or plans)
outside of this Agreement. In addition, Employee does not hereby release any
rights he may have under the Merger Agreement (including his right to receive
the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined therein) in respect
of equity securities held by him and including his Escrow Contribution, all
in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) or any of
the related Transaction Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

  



  

 **B**. ** **In return for the benefits listed in Section I(B)
above, Employee, on behalf of Employee, Employees heirs, executors, family
members, beneficiaries, assignees, administrators, successors, and executors
or anyone acting or claiming to act on Employees behalf, hereby releases and
forever discharges the Released Parties from any and all claims or causes of
action of any type, both known and unknown, arising under or relating to the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the foregoing, this Agreement does not release any rights
or claims Employee may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or
any of the Companys benefit plans which arise after Employee signs this
Agreement or which arise from acts occurring after Employee signs this
Agreement.

  



  

 **C**. ** **Additionally, although Employee, pursuant to this Agreement, is
not releasing, waiving, or discharging Employees right to file or be a
witness in, a federal, state or local charge of discrimination, Employee, on
behalf of Employee and any and all heirs and assigns, hereby knowingly,
voluntarily and intentionally agrees to and does fully and finally release
and/or waive Employees right to receive compensation or monetary relief from
said charge(s).

  



  

 **III**. ** ****NON-ADMISSION**.

  



  

It is understood and agreed that this Agreement does not constitute
an admission by the Company or Lawson or any of their predecessors or
successors of any liability, wrongdoing, or violation of any law. Further,
the Company and Lawson expressly deny any wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever
in their actions and dealings with Employee. Employee acknowledges
and agrees that the Company and Lawson have no obligation to hire or
employ Employee in the future.

  



  

 **IV**. ** ****CONFIDENTIALITY, NONDISPARAGEMENT AND NO ASSISTANCE ADVERSE
TO COMPANY**.

  



  

 **A**. ** **_Confidentiality_.  In consideration of the promises set forth
in Section I above, Employee promises and represents that Employee will not
personally, nor will Employee authorize any other representative, employee,
agent, or attorney acting on Employees behalf to disclose, disseminate, or
publicize, or permit to be disclosed, disseminated, or publicized, any of the
terms of this Agreement to any outside third person except as may be required
by law. The term "person" utilized above shall include individuals,
corporations, partnerships, associations, subsidiaries, divisions or
government agencies.  Notwithstanding the above, Employee may communicate
information regarding this Agreement to Employees spouse, personal legal
counsel and tax advisor, each of whom will first be advised of the
confidential nature of this Agreement, and each person who receives this
confidential information shall be directed not to disclose, disseminate or
otherwise publicize its terms.

        
   

  



  

 **B**. ** **_Nondisparagement_.  Employee covenants and agrees not to
knowingly make any disparaging remarks, either orally or in writing,
regarding the Company, Lawson, or any of their respective employees, officers
or directors. This Agreement does not restrict or prevent Employee from (a)
responding to or cooperating with any governmental inquiry or investigation
or (b) providing truthful testimony in any deposition or proceeding.

  



  

 **C**. ** **_No Assistance Adverse to Company_.  In consideration of the
payments to Employee under this Agreement, Employee covenants and agrees to
not hereafter contact, respond to or otherwise knowingly assist in any
manner, any employee or former employee of the Company (or any parent,
subsidiary, predecessor or successor) concerning any actual or potential
claims or legal actions against the Company (or any parent, subsidiary,
predecessor or successor), unless (a) compelled to do so by a court of
competent jurisdiction or (b) required to do so in writing by the Equal
Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC), the Department of Human Rights or
another governmental agency. Unless prohibited by applicable law or
regulation, Employee shall provide the Companys or Lawsons current chief
executive officer prompt written notice of any such requested assistance that
relates to the Company or its successor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to prohibit Employee from participating in a charge before an
administrative body or entity for non-monetary relief.

  



  

 **V**. ** ****COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**.

  



  

Employee acknowledges his continuing obligations under his Nondisclosure,
Developments Agreement and Non-Solicit Agreement, a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit A.

  



  

 **VI**. **NON-SOLICITATION AND NO-HIRE.**

  



  

Employee covenants and agrees that for 12 months after the effective date of
this Agreement, Employee will not directly or indirectly solicit any
employees of the Company or Lawson or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates for the purpose of hiring them or inducing them to leave
employment with the Company or Lawson or any of their subsidiaries or
affiliates.

  



  

 **VII**. ** ****JOB REFERENCE AND NO RE-HIRE**.

  



  

If the Company or Lawson is contacted regarding a job reference for Employee,
the Company and Lawson agree only to give the dates of Employees employment
and the position held, except as otherwise required by law. Employee agrees
that Employee will not apply for another position with the Company or Lawson
and Employee will not be eligible for re-hire. Lawson agrees that Lawsons
executive management will not knowingly make any disparaging statements or
comments about Employee concerning Employees employment or his cessation of
employment.

  



  

 **VIII**. ** ****RETURN OF COMPANY RECORDS, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**.

  



  

By January , 2010, Employee shall return to the Company (by delivering
in person or using the postage prepaid mailer supplied by Company), all
Company or Lawson (or their respective their affiliates or subsidiaries)
records, materials, property and equipment possessed by Employee, including,
without limitation, Employees key cards and credit cards, any documents
belonging to the Company or Lawson (or their respective affiliates or
subsidiaries) or that contain confidential information, and any other Company
or Lawson (or their respective affiliates or subsidiaries) property possessed
anywhere by Employee. In the event that Employee finds any Company or Lawson
(or their respective affiliates or subsidiaries) property, including without
limitation documents or electronic equipment, after his last day
of employment, Employee shall promptly return such property to the Company.

        
   

  



  

 **IX.** ** ****OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER AND SEEK ADVICE AND CONFIRMATION OF
UNDERSTANDING**.

  



  

Employee acknowledges that Employee received this Agreement on January
, 2010. Employee has been advised by the Company and Lawson that Employee
has the right to consult with an attorney (at Employees own expense) before
signing this Agreement, and that Employee has twenty-one (21) calendar days
after the date on which Employee received this Agreement to consider whether
or not Employee wishes to sign it. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Employee expressly waives this twenty-one (21) day period. If Employee signs
this Agreement without the benefit of the twenty-one (21) calendar day
period, it will be his personal and voluntary decision to do so.

  



  

Employee acknowledges that Employee has read and understands this entire
Agreement, and has had sufficient opportunity to ask the Company and Lawson
any questions about this Agreement.  If Employee has asked the Company and
Lawson any questions about this Agreement, all questions have been answered
and Employee understands and is satisfied with all of those answers.

  



  

 **X**. ** ****EFFECTIVENESS OF AGREEMENT; OPPORTUNITY TO RESCIND**.

  



  

This Agreement shall become effective only upon the expiration of the 7-day
rescission period set forth below.  If Employee rescinds this Agreement

"Rescission Event"), then this Agreement shall forthwith (without the
requirement of any further action by the parties) become immediately null and
void and without any further force or effect.

  



  

Employee understands that Employee may cancel this Agreement for any reason
within seven (7) calendar days after Employee has signed it. If Employee

contrary contained herein, the Agreement shall not become effective or
enforceable until this 7-day rescission period has expired.

  



  

Employee acknowledges and agrees that, if he rescinds this Agreement, then he
shall promptly refund to the Company any portion of the Severance Benefits
previously paid to him.

  



  

 **XI**. ** ****COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF AGREEMENT; REVIEW BY LEGAL COUNSEL**.

  



  

This Agreement and the agreements referenced herein (including the Offer
Letter) contain the entire understanding and agreement between the Company,
Lawson and Employee with respect to the matters discussed herein; provided,
however, that, if this Agreement is rescinded in accordance with Section,
then the Offer Letter shall remain in full force and effect. Unless a
Rescission Event occurs, then this Agreement shall supersede, replace and
terminate the Offer Letter. Employee expressly agrees and acknowledges that
any nondisclosure or similar agreement with the Company, including
his Nondisclosure, Developments Agreement and Non-Solicit Agreement, shall
remain in full force and effect and is not altered by this Agreement.
Employee acknowledges each of the following: (1) Employee may consult with
Employees own attorney at Employees expense, (2) Employee has had an
opportunity to be represented by Employees own attorney before signing
this Agreement, (3) the Companys counsel represents the Company and does
not represent or serve as legal counsel for Employee, and Lawson counsel
represents Lawson and does not represent or serve as legal counsel for
Employee, (4) Employee has read and understands the terms of this Agreement,
(5) Employee is voluntarily entering this Agreement to take advantage of the
benefits offered, and (6) there have been no promises leading to the signing
of this Agreement except those that have been expressly contained in this
written document.

  



  

 **XII**. ** ****COOPERATION**

  



  

Employee agrees that Employee will cooperate with the Company and Lawson (at
the Companys expense) as follows:

        
   

  



  

 **A**. ** **_Legal Proceedings_. ** **In the event that any legal proceeding
arises in which the Company, Lawson or any of their respective affiliated
entities, parents, or successors deems Employees testimony or participation
to be relevant or necessary, Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company,
Lawson or the affiliated entity, parent, or successor in connection with the
proceeding by providing testimony through affidavit, in a deposition, or at a
hearing or trial, or otherwise assisting the Company, Lawson or affiliated
entity or successor with respect to the proceeding. This provision is not
intended to affect the substance of any testimony that Employee is asked to
provide. Rather, Employee agrees to provide truthful testimony and to
otherwise assist the Company, Lawson or affiliated entity in light of and in
full compliance will all applicable laws.

  



  

 **B**. ** **_Consultation_. **** In the event that any questions arise with
regard to any information or subject that Employee developed, of which
Employee had knowledge or with which Employee was otherwise involved during
the period of Employees employment with the Company, Employee agrees
to reasonably cooperate with and respond to any request by the Company,
Lawson or any affiliated entity, parent, or successor for advice, opinions,
or other information responsive to the question posed.

  



  

 **XIII**. ** ****NON-ASSIGNMENT**.

  



  

Employee, the Company and Lawson agree that this Agreement may not
be assigned by either party unless the other party consents in writing,
except that Company may assign this Agreement without Employees consent to
Lawson or any parent, subsidiary, or successor thereof or in connection with
a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or
any applicable operating division.

  



  

 **XIV**. ** ****SAVINGS CLAUSE**.

  



  

If any provision of this Agreement is determined later to be invalid,
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Moreover, if
one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any
reason, be held to be excessively broad as to scope, activity, subject, or
otherwise, so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision or provisions
shall be construed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting or reducing
it or them, so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with
then applicable law. However, if the Release contained in Section II(A)
is held to be void or unenforceable in any respect, then this entire
Agreement shall be voidable at the Companys option.  Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to or shall be construed as entitling the Company to
abrogate or require tender back of the severance payment of Section I(B)
relating to the enforcement of Section II(B).

  



  

 **XV**. ** ****EMPLOYER S REMEDIES**.

  



  

Employee acknowledges that the violation of any of the terms of this
Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Company and Lawson, and he
agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law, an injunction
against the violation of the Agreement and Release may be issued against
Employee. Both damages and injunction shall be proper modes of relief and are
not alternative remedies. If the Company or Lawson commences any action in
equity to specifically enforce any of their rights under this
Agreement, Employee waives and agrees not to assert the defense that the
Company or Lawson have an adequate remedy at law. All payments under this
Agreement shall cease upon Employees violation of any of its terms, except
for the severance payment under Section I(B) as it relates to the enforcement
of Section II(B).

  



  

 **XVI**. ** ****GOVERNING LAW AND GENERAL**.

  



  

This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws
of the State of Texas. The Company, Lawson and the Employee acknowledge that
the Released Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
Agreement.  The parties to this agreement agree and acknowledge that this
Agreement shall be considered to have been drafted equally by each of the
parties. The headings of all of the paragraphs and subparagraphs of this
Agreement are inserted only for convenience for reference, and are not part
of this Agreement.

        
   

  



  

 **XVII**. ** ****GUARANTEE**

  



  

Lawson hereby guarantees the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
to pay the Severance Benefits.  The obligations of Lawson under this Section
XVII are subject in all respects to all rights and defenses of the Company
arising under this Agreement and the contemplated transactions and will in
all events terminate upon the occurrence of a Rescission Event.

Lawson Software Americas, Inc.

  

380 St. Peter Street

  

St. Paul, MN 55102

  



  

 **Re:** Acquisition of Quovadx Holdings, Inc. by Lawson Software Americas,
Inc.

  

 ** **

  

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

We have acted as counsel for Quovadx Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " ** _Company_** ") and each of Battery Ventures VII, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the " **Stockholders  Agent**") and Battery Ventures
VII, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively with the
Stockholders Agent, the " **Principal Stockholders** "), in connection with
the merger (the " ** _Merger_** ") of the Company with Highway Acquisition,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Merger Sub_** ") and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Lawson Software Americas, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
**Parent** ") under the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January
7, 2010 (the " ** _Acquisition Agreement_** "), by and among the Company,
Parent, the Merger Sub, Battery Ventures VII, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership and Battery Investment Partners VII, LLC, each in their capacity
as Principal Stockholders, and Battery Ventures VII, L.P. in its capacity as
the Stockholders Agent. We have also acted as counsel for Healthvision
Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Healthvision Solutions_**
"), Healthvision, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Healthvision_**
"), Advica Health Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Advica_**
"), Confer Software, Inc., a California corporation (" ** _Confer_** ") and
Quovadx International, Inc., a Colorado corporation (" ** _Quovadx
International_** ", and together with Healthvision Solutions, Healthvision,
Advica, and Confer, the " ** _Company Subsidiaries_** "). We are rendering
this opinion pursuant to Section 7(e) of the Acquisition Agreement. Except
as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used but not defined herein
have the respective meanings given to them in the Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the
representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in and made
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement by the various parties and originals or
copies certified to our satisfaction, of such records,
documents, certificates, opinions, memoranda and other instruments as in our
judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion
expressed below.

  



  

As to certain factual matters we have relied upon certificates of officers of
the Company and Company Subsidiaries and have not sought to independently
verify such matters.  Where we render an opinion "to our knowledge" or
concerning an item "known to us" or our opinion otherwise refers to our
knowledge, it is based solely upon (i) an inquiry of attorneys within this
firm who have represented the Company and Company Subsidiaries, (ii) receipt
of a certificate

        
   

  



  

executed by an officer of the Company and Company Subsidiaries covering such
matters, and (iii) such other investigation, if any, that we specifically set
forth herein.

  



  

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed: the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals; the conformity to originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies; the accuracy, completeness and authenticity of
certificates of public officials; the due authorization, execution and
delivery of all documents (except the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company of the Acquisition Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the releases delivered in satisfaction of Sections 7.2(f) of the
Acquisition Agreement executed by the Principal Stockholders (together, the "
** _Transaction Agreements_** ")), where authorization, execution and
delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness of such documents; and the
genuineness and authenticity of all signatures on original documents (except
the signatures on behalf of the Company on the Transaction Agreements).  We
have also assumed: that the Transaction Agreements are obligations binding
upon the parties thereto other than the Company; and that there are no
extrinsic agreements or understandings among the parties to the Transaction
Agreements that would modify or interpret the terms of any such Agreements or
the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.

  



  

Our opinion is expressed only with respect to (i) the federal laws of the
United States of America and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
(ii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; and (iii) for
purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the laws of the State of California solely
with respect to Confer and the laws of the State of Colorado solely with
respect to Quovadx International. We express no opinion as to whether the
laws of any particular jurisdiction apply, and no opinion to the extent that
the laws of any jurisdiction other than those identified above are applicable
to the subject matter hereof. We note that the parties to the Transaction
Agreements have designated the laws of the State of the State of Delaware as
the laws governing the Transaction Agreements. Our opinion in paragraph 5
below as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the
Transaction Agreements relating to the Principal Stockholders is premised
upon the result that would obtain if a Massachusetts court were to apply the
internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (notwithstanding the
designation of the laws of the State of Delaware) to the interpretation and
enforcement of the Transaction Agreements.

  



  

We are not rendering any opinion as to any statute, rule, regulation,
ordinance, decree or decisional law relating to antitrust, banking, land use,
environmental, pension, employee benefit, tax, fraudulent conveyance, usury,
or local law or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as
Amended.  Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to compliance
with antifraud laws, rules or regulations relating to securities or the
offer and sale thereof; compliance with fiduciary duties by the Companys
Board of Directors or stockholders; compliance with safe harbors for
disinterested Board of Director or shareholder approvals; compliance with
state securities or blue sky laws except as specifically set forth below;
compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940; compliance with laws that
place limitations on corporate distributions; or the enforceability of any
covenant not to compete or any covenant in restraint of trade.

  



  

With regard to our opinion in paragraphs 1 and 2 below with respect to the
good standing of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, we have relied solely
upon certificates of the Secretaries of

        
   

  



  

State of the indicated jurisdictions as of a recent date, copies of which
have been provided to you, and our opinions are rendered as of such dates, as
applicable.

  



  

With regard to our opinion in paragraph 6 below, we have examined and relied
upon a certificate executed by an officer of the Company, to the effect that
the consideration for all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
was received by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Board of Directors resolutions and any plan or agreement relating
to the issuance of such shares, and we have undertaken no independent
verification with respect thereto.

  



  

With regard to our opinion in paragraph 7 below concerning the agreements set
forth on _Schedule I_ (the " ** _Material Agreements_** "), we express
no opinion as to (i) financial covenants or similar provisions
therein requiring financial calculations or determinations to ascertain
compliance, (ii) provisions therein relating to the occurrence of a "material
adverse event" or words of similar import, or (iii) any statement or writing
that may constitute parol evidence bearing on interpretation or construction.

  



  

With regard to our opinion in paragraph 8 below with respect to pending or
overtly threatened litigation, we have made an inquiry of the attorneys
within this firm who have represented the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, examined and relied upon a certificate executed by an
officer of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries covering such matters,
and checked the records of this firm to ascertain that we are not acting as
counsel of record for the Company or Company Subsidiaries in any such matter.
We have made no further investigation.

  



  

On the basis of the foregoing, in reliance thereon and with the foregoing
qualifications, we are of the opinion that:

  



  

 **1.** ** **Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing (except for Confer,
which is not in good standing) under the laws of its state of incorporation.
**[Note: if Confer is in good standing in California upon issuance of this
opinion the carve out will be removed.]**

  



  

 **2.** ** **Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good __ standing
under the laws of the respective states identified on _Schedule II_ hereof.

  



  

 **3.** ** **Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has the
organizational power to own or lease its current properties, as known to us,
and conduct its business as, to our knowledge, it is presently conducted.

  



  

 **4.** ** **Each of the Company and the Principal Stockholders has the
corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements.

  



  

 **5.** ** **Each of the Transaction Agreements has been duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Principal
Stockholders and constitutes legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of the Principal Stockholders.

        
   

  



  

 **6.** ** **The Companys authorized capital stock consists of (a)
30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.001, of which 19,721,199 shares
are issued and outstanding, and (b) 3,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par
value $.001, all of which have been designated Series A Perpetual Preferred
Stock, par value $.001, of which 2,282,000 shares are issued and outstanding.
The outstanding shares of Common Stock and of Series A Perpetual
Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable. To our knowledge, there are no options, warrants,
conversion privileges, preemptive rights or other rights presently
outstanding to purchase any of the authorized but unissued capital stock of
the Company, other than the conversion privileges of the Series A Perpetual
Preferred Stock and 600,000 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance
under the Companys 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, of which (i) 196,708 shares
of Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and
(ii) 403,292 shares of Common Stock are available for grant.

  



  

 **7.** ** **The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the
Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will not violate, conflict with,
breach or constitute a default under (a) any provision of the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (b) any governmental statute, rule
or regulation which in our experience is typically applicable to transactions
of the nature contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (c) any
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award which has
been entered against the Company and of which we are aware, or (d) any of
the Material Agreements listed on _Schedule I_ , in each case to the extent
the violation of which would materially and adversely affect the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

 **8.** ** **To our knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration, or investigation pending or overtly threatened against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries before any federal, state,
municipal, foreign or other court or governmental or administrative body or
agency, or any private arbitration tribunal that questions the validity
of, or which would otherwise have the effect of prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, or that could
reasonably be expected to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in
a material adverse effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

  



  

 **9.** ** **The Merger and the Acquisition Agreement have each been duly
approved by the Company by all requisite Board of Directors and stockholder
action and, assuming all necessary Board of Directors and stockholder
approvals on the part of Parent and the Merger Sub, upon acceptance for
filing by the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
of the Certificate of Merger, the Merger will become effective under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 **FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT**

  



  

This Escrow Agreement (this " ** _Escrow Agreement_** ") is entered into as
of January [*], 2010 (the " ** _Effective Date_** ") by and among: (a) Lawson
Software Americas, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "); (b)
R. David Tabors in his capacity as the Stockholders Agent (the " **
_Stockholders  Agent_**") on behalf of the Escrow Participants (as defined
below); and (c) Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as escrow agent
hereunder (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** "). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them
in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

 _RECITALS_ :

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Quovadx Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
** _Company_** "), Highway Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), Battery Ventures
VII, L.P. and Battery Investment Partners VII, LLC, in their capacity as the
Principal Stockholders and the Stockholders Agent have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 7, 2010 (the " ** _Merger
Agreement_** "), pursuant to which, among other things, at the Effective
Date, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company
will be the surviving corporation following the Merger; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , in accordance with Section 11.1 of the Merger Agreement, the
Principal Stockholders and Russell Fleischer (the " **Escrow Participants** ")
have appointed the Stockholders Agent to act on their individual and
collective behalf with respect to the taking of actions under the Merger
Agreement and this Escrow Agreement; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Escrow
Agreement, Parent will deliver $16,000,000 (the " ** _Escrow Deposit_** ") to
the Escrow Agent, to be held and disbursed, as hereinafter provided and as
provided in the Merger Agreement, to satisfy the obligations (if any) of the
Escrow Participants to make payments with respect to claims made under
Section 9 of the Merger Agreement, under Section 1.9 of the Merger Agreement,
and as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the parties to the Merger Agreement desire that the Escrow
Agent serve as escrow agent and the Escrow Agent desires to so serve, all in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

 **NOW THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. **_Appointment_**.

  



  

(a) **_Escrow Agent_**.  Parent and the Stockholders Agent hereby designate
and appoint the Escrow Agent to serve as their escrow agent for the purposes
set forth herein, and the Escrow

        
   

  



  

Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

  



  

(b) **_Stockholders  Agent_**.  The Stockholders Agent represents and
warrants to Parent and the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Participants have
duly appointed the Stockholders Agent to act on behalf of such Escrow
Participants in connection with the Merger Agreement, this Escrow Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including with respect to the
signing of any documents and the taking of any actions necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Escrow Agreement on
behalf of the Escrow Participants. If either Parent or the Escrow Agent
receives any certificate, notice, consent or instrument from the
Stockholders Agent they are entitled to rely upon, and act in accordance
with, such certificate, notice, consent or instrument in regards to the
rights of such Escrow Participants. If the person or entity named above as
Stockholders Agent is removed or resigns, the Stockholders Agent will
immediately give notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, and such notice will
identify the person or persons to replace the current Stockholders Agent.

  



  

2. **_Escrow Fund_**.  Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Escrow Agreement, Parent is depositing with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Deposit in immediately available funds. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Deposit in escrow in the Escrow Account (as defined below), free and clear of any lien or encumbrance, against potential claims by Parent pursuant to Section 9 of the Merger Agreement and the obligations of the Escrow Participants under Section 1.9 of the Merger Agreement (collectively, " ** _Claims_** "), and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Deposit, together with any proceeds thereof and earnings thereon (the " ** _Escrow Fund_** ") as directed in Section 3.

  



  

3. **_Investment of Escrow Fund_**.  During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent in (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market mutual funds backed by government issued or guaranteed securities, or (iii) such other investments as shall be directed jointly in a writing executed by Parent and the Stockholders Agent and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Agent. In the absence of written investment instructions, the Escrow Fund shall be invested in the Wells Fargo Institutional Money Market Deposit Account (" ** _IMMDA_** "), which is further described herein on **_Schedule 1_**. Parent and the Stockholders Agent acknowledge that they have read and understand **_Schedule 1_**. Periodic statements will be provided to Parent and the Stockholders Agent reflecting transactions executed on behalf of the Escrow Fund.  Parent and the Stockholders Agent, upon written request, will receive a statement of transaction details upon completion of any investment, reinvestment, or other transaction in the Escrow Fund without any additional cost. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment listed in (i) or (ii) above, as a result of any investment made pursuant to the joint written instructions of Parent and the Stockholders Agent or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Fund. Parent and the Stockholders Agent acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or advice.

  



        
   

  



  

4. **_Disposition and Termination_**.

  



  

(a) If the Escrow Agent receives joint written instructions at any time
signed by both Parent and the Stockholders Agent directing the disposition
of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall release from
the Escrow Fund the amount set forth in such instructions as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days (as defined
hereinafter) after the date of the Escrow Agents receipt of such
instructions.

  



  

(b) If Parent seeks the release of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund during
the period prior to the Final Distribution Date in connection with a Claim
pursuant to and in accordance with Sections 9 or 1.9 of the Merger Agreement,
Parent shall provide written notice concurrently to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholders Agent describing the Claim (a " ** _Notice of Claim_** "),
which Notice of Claim shall set forth the Claim in reasonable detail,
including Parents good faith estimate of the amount of the Claim, and other
evidence indicating that Parent is entitled to indemnification under Section
9 of the Merger Agreement or an adjustment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.9 of the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent will have
no obligation to verify the validity of any Notice of Claim or that delivery
of such Notice of Claim has been made by Parent to the Stockholders Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall release to Parent the amount set forth in such Notice
of Claim from the Escrow Fund on the date that is ten (10) Business Days
after the Escrow Agents receipt of such written Notice of Claim unless,
within such ten (10) Business Day period, the Stockholders Agent provides
written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent disputing, in good faith, the
validity or appropriateness of the release of such amount to Parent (the " **
_Response Notice_** "). In the event that the Escrow Agent receives
a Response Notice from the Stockholders Agent within such 10-Business Day
period disputing Parents right to all or any portion of the amount sought in
the Notice of Claim, then the Escrow Agent shall (i) continue to hold
the disputed portion of the Escrow Fund sought in such Notice of Claim (any
such amounts, the " ** _Reserved Amounts_** "), together with any portion of
the Escrow Fund not subject to such Notice of Claim or Response Notice, (ii)
release to Parent such non-disputed portion of the Escrow Fund sought in the
Notice of Claim, and (iii) release such disputed portion of the Escrow Fund
sought in the Notice of Claim upon receiving joint written instructions from
Parent and the Stockholders Agent to effect such release. If within fifteen
(15) Business Days of Parents receipt of a Response Notice, Parent and the
Stockholders Agent do not resolve any amount disputed in such Response
Notice, then Parent and the Stockholders Agent will resolve any dispute in
accordance with the procedures for resolving such disputes contained in the
Merger Agreement. Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall submit evidence of
the final resolution of such dispute to the Escrow Agent within two (2)
Business Days of the final resolution of such dispute, and the Escrow Agent
shall disburse or retain the disputed amount in accordance with such
resolution.

  



  

(c) On [ **Insert date that is one year following the Effective Time** ] (the
" ** _Final Distribution Date_** "), the Escrow Agent shall release to
the Stockholders Agent all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund, if any,
less any Reserved Amounts that would be required under Section 4(b) to
satisfy pending or unresolved Claims properly asserted pursuant to a Notice
of Claim received by the Escrow Agent prior to the Final Distribution Date.
Such funds shall be released pursuant to written instructions provided to the
Escrow Agent by the Stockholders Agent (the " ** _Final Distribution
Instructions_** "). The Escrow Agent shall distribute the final

  



        
   

  



  

payments to the Stockholders Agent by wire transfer to an account(s)
specified for such purpose as indicated on **_Schedule 2_** or to such
account(s) as otherwise specified by the Final Distribution Instructions.

  



  

(d) Any Reserved Amounts shall remain in escrow until the final resolution of
the related Claims. Following final resolution of any such Claims, the
Reserved Amounts shall be released pursuant to the joint written instructions
of Parent and the Stockholders Agent or in accordance with the final
resolution of such dispute, which shall be submitted to the Escrow Agent by
Parent and the Stockholders Agent within two (2) Business Days after such
resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Notice of Claim relates to a
Claim under Section 1.9 of the Merger Agreement and Parent and the
Stockholders Agent have submitted the Claim to an accounting firm in
accordance with Section 1.9(d) of the Merger Agreement, then the Escrow Agent
will consider the determination of such accounting firm to be final and
binding on the parties and upon receipt of such determination along with
joint written instruction of Parent and the Stockholders Agent to disburse
an amount of the Escrow Fund specified in such accounting firm determination,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver the amount of such Claim to Parent in
accordance with such accounting firm determination and joint instruction.

  



  

(e) Upon the distribution of all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund, this
Escrow Agreement shall terminate.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Escrow Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, this Escrow Agreement and the deposit of the Escrow Deposit
are without prejudice to and are not in limitation of any obligations of
Parent, the Stockholders Agent, the Principal Stockholders or the Escrow
Participants in respect to any of the covenants, representations or
warranties of such parties contained in the Merger Agreement.

by the Escrow Agent ("** _Escrow Account_ **") shall not pass to
the Stockholders  Agent unless and until the time that the Escrow Agent
is obligated to distribute such funds to the Stockholders Agent in

investments or reinvestments of, the Escrow Fund, net of any tax payments
under Section 10 of this Escrow Agreement, shall be allocated and paid to the

otherwise instruct the Escrow Agent by joint written instruction. Any and all
necessary calculations and pro rata percentages pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement shall be included in the joint written instructions sent to the
Escrow Agent by the Stockholders Agent and the Parent.**

  



        
   

  



  

6. **_Escrow Agent_**.

agreement other than this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or
refraining from acting upon any written notice, instruction or request
furnished to it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, without further
inquiry into the persons or persons authority. Concurrently herewith, Parent
shall deliver an executed authorized signers list in the form of
**_Schedule 3_** hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire
into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document.

  



  

(c) The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be

taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all
property held in the Escrow Fund until it shall be directed otherwise in
writing by all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction. Alternatively, the Escrow Agent may, at
its option, file an interpleader action in any court of
competent jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof and deposit of the Escrow
Fund with such court, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as
to the Escrow Fund and shall be entitled to recover attorneys fees, expenses
and other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such
interpleader action.

profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

  



        
   

  



  

(h) No provision of this Escrow Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to
risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability or
potential financial liability in the performance of its duties or the
exercise of its rights hereunder.

  



  

(i) In the event that any of the Escrow Fund shall be attached, garnished or
levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or
enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court order affecting the Escrow Fund, the Escrow
Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as
it deems appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so
entered or issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own
choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the
event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or
decree it shall not be liable to Parent, the Escrow Participants or to any
other person, firm or corporation, should, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding, such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed,

3. Termination Policies.

  



  

(a) Canadian Employee Severance Policy (as listed in Canada Employees
Handbook). If the employees employment is terminated not for cause, the
Company shall either give the employee notice of termination or pay in lieu
and, if required under applicable statute, shall also pay the employee
severance pay. Payments will be paid out on a pro-rated calculation based on
length of service with the Company. From date of hire to one year of service,
employees will receive two weeks of notice or pay in lieu. After the first
year of service, employees will receive an additional one week of notice or
pay in lieu for each year of service and, if required by applicable statute,
also statutory severance pay. The payout will be prorated based on date of
hire. In no event will an employee receive less than their minimum statutory
entitlement.

  



  

(b) United States Employee Severance Policy (as listed in U.S. Employee
Handbook). If the Employees employment is terminated not for cause, the
Company shall pay the Employee severance pay. Severance will be paid out on a
pro-rated calculation based on length of service with the Company. From date
of hire to one year of service employees will receive two weeks of severance
pay. After the first year of service, employees will receive an additional
one week of severance pay for each year of service. The payout will be
prorated based on date of hire. Severance payouts are at CEOs discretion.
