liabilities (accrued or otherwise) allocable to the  operations of the
Stations for the period prior to the Effective Time, and  Buyer shall
receive all revenues and shall be responsible for all expenses,  costs, and

(i) There shall be no adjustment for,  and Sellers shall remain solely
liable with respect to, any Contracts not  included in the Assumed Contracts
and any other obligation or liability not  being assumed by Buyer in
accordance with Section 2.5. An adjustment and proration shall be made
in  favor of Buyer to the extent that Buyer (i) assumes any liability under
any  Assumed Contract to refund (or to credit against payments otherwise
due) any  security deposit or similar prepayment paid to Sellers by any
lessee or other  third party or (ii) assumes any liability or obligation,
the benefit of which  was received by any Seller prior to the Effective

(ii) An adjustment and proration shall be  made in favor of Sellers for the
amount, if any, by which the fair market value  of the goods or services to

the Effective Time exceeds by more than Two Hundred  Thousand Dollars
($200,000.00) the fair market value of any advertising time  remaining to be
run by the Stations as of the Effective Time pursuant to such  trade or
barter agreements. An  adjustment and proration shall be made in favor of
Buyer to the extent that the  amount of any advertising time remaining to be
run by the Stations under their  trade or barter agreements as of the
Effective Time exceeds by more than Two  Hundred Thousand Dollars
($200,000.00) the fair market value of the goods or  services to be received
by the Stations as of the Effective Time pursuant to  such trade or barter
agreements.

    



    

(iii) There shall be no proration for  program barter, except with respect
to cash consideration paid in connection  with the renewal or extension of
program barter agreements listed in Schedule  3.7.

    



    

(iv) An adjustment and proration shall be  made in favor of Sellers for the

hereunder, and other current assets acquired  by Buyer hereunder which are
paid by Sellers to the extent such prepaid  expenses and other current
assets relate to the period after the Effective  Time.

    



    

(v) Except as otherwise provided in this  Section 2.3(b) or as set forth on
Schedule 2.3(b)(v), an adjustment and  proration shall be made in favor of
Buyer for (A) the amount, if any, of  deferred revenue, the benefit of which

(the "WB") to any of the Sellers (or any Affiliate  thereof) in connection
with the affiliation of either of the Stations with the  WB.

(c) **_Manner of Determining Adjustments_**. The Purchase Price, taking into
account the  adjustments and prorations pursuant to Section 2.3(b), will be
determined in  accordance with the following procedures:

    



    

(i) Sellers shall prepare and deliver to  Buyer not later than three (3)
Business Days before the Closing Date a  preliminary settlement statement
which shall set forth Sellers good faith  estimate of the adjustments to
the Purchase Price under Section 2.3(b) with  respect to the Stations. The
preliminary  settlement statement shall (A) contain all information
reasonably necessary to  determine the adjustments to the Purchase Price
under Section 2.3(b) as to the  Stations, to the extent such adjustments can
be determined or estimated as of  the date of the preliminary settlement
statement, and such other information as  may be reasonably requested by
Buyer, and (B) be certified by Sellers to be  true and complete to Sellers
Knowledge as of the date thereof.

    



    

(ii) Not later than ninety (90) calendar  days after the Closing Date, Buyer
will deliver to Sellers a statement setting  forth Buyers determination of
the Purchase Price and the calculation thereof  pursuant to Section 2.3(b)
as to the Stations.   Buyers statement (A) shall contain all information
reasonably necessary  to determine the adjustments to the Purchase Price
under Section 2.3(b) and  such other information as may be reasonably
requested by Sellers, and (B) shall  be certified by Buyer to be true and
complete to Buyers knowledge as of the  date thereof. If Sellers dispute
the  amount of such Purchase Price determined by Buyer, they shall deliver
to Buyer  within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of Buyers
statement a statement  setting forth their determination of the amount of
such Purchase Price. If Sellers notify Buyer of its acceptance of  Buyers
statement, or if Sellers fail to deliver their statement within the  thirty
(30) calendar day period specified in the preceding sentence,
Buyers  determination of the Purchase Price shall be conclusive and binding
on the  parties.

    



    

(iii) Buyer and Sellers shall use good faith  efforts to resolve any dispute
involving the determination of the Purchase  Price paid by Buyer at the
Closing. If  the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within forty-five
(45) calendar  days following the delivery of all of Buyers statements to
be provided  pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) after the Closing, Buyer and
Sellers shall  jointly designate an independent certified public accounting
firm of national  standing which has not regularly provided services to
either the Buyer or  Sellers in the last three (3) years, who shall be
knowledgeable and experienced  in the operation of television broadcasting
stations, to resolve the  dispute. If the parties are unable to  agree on
the designation of an independent certified public accounting firm,  the
selection of the accounting firm to resolve the dispute shall be
submitted  to arbitration to be held in Baltimore, Maryland, in accordance
with the  commercial arbitration rules of the Ameri­can Arbi­tra­tion
Asso­ci­a­tion. The accounting firms resolution of the  dispute shall be
final and binding on the parties, and a judgment may be  entered thereon in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Any fees of this accounting firm, and,
if  necessary, for arbitration to select such accountant, shall be divided
equally  between the parties.

    



    

2.4. **_Payment  of Purchase Price_**. The Purchase Price shall be paid by
Buyer to Sellers at the  Closing as follows:

    



    

12

              
      



    

(a) **_Payment of Estimated Purchase Price At Closing_**. The Purchase Price,
adjusted by the  estimated adjustments pursuant to Section 2.3(b) as set
forth in Sellers  preliminary settlement statement pursuant to Section
2.3(c)(i), is referred to  as the "Estimated Purchase Price". At  the
Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers the
Estimated  Purchase Price for the Assets by federal wire transfer of same-
day funds  pursuant to wire transfer instructions, which instructions shall
be delivered  to Buyer by Sellers at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

    



    

(b) Buyer and Sellers shall cause the  Escrow Deposit to be released to
Sellers on the Closing Date as partial payment  of the Estimated Purchase
Price by delivering wiring instructions to the Escrow  Agent two (2)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date.

    



    

(c) **_Payments to Reflect Adjustments_**. The Purchase Price as finally
determined  pursuant to Section 2.3(c) shall be paid as follows:

    



    

(i) If the Purchase Price as finally  determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price,  Buyer shall pay to Sellers, in
immediately available funds within five (5)  Business Days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is determined pursuant  to Section 2.3(c), the
difference between the Purchase Price and the Estimated  Purchase Price.

    



    

(ii) If the Purchase Price as finally  determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
is less than the Estimated Purchase  Price, Sellers shall pay to Buyer, in
immediately available funds within five  (5) Business Days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is determined  pursuant to Section 2.3(c), the
difference between the Purchase Price and the  Estimated Purchase Price.

    



    

2.5. **_Assumption  of Liabilities and Obligations_**. As of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall assume  and undertake to pay, discharge, and perform all
obligations and liabilities of  Sellers under the Licenses, the Assumed
Contracts, or as otherwise specifically  provided for herein to the extent
that either (i) the obligations and  liabilities relate to the time after
the Effective Time (including as a result  of any deferral disclosed on
Schedule 2.3(b)(v)), or (ii) the Purchase Price  was reduced pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) as a result of the proration of such  obligations and
liabilities; _provided_ liabilities arising under any  Environmental Laws
which arise after the Effective Time shall be treated as  relating to the
time after the Effective Time notwithstanding that the  conditions giving
rise to such liabilities may have existed prior to the  Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , such treatment shall not limit  Buyers rights to
indemnification pursuant to, and subject to the limitations  of, Section 10
hereof. Except to the  extent provided to the contrary herein, Buyer shall
not assume any other  obligations or liabilities of Sellers, including (1)
any obligations or  liabilities under any Contract not included in the

 ** _SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS_**

    



    

Each Seller jointly and  severally represents and warrants to Buyer as of
the date hereof and as of the  Closing Date (except for representations and
warranties that speak as of a  specific date or time, in which case, such
representations and warranties shall  be true and complete as of such date
or time) as follows:

    



    

3.1. **_Organization  and Authority of Sellers_**. Each Seller is a
corporation, limited  liability company, or limited partnership (as
applicable), duly organized,  validly existing, and in good standing under
the laws of the State listed on  Schedule 3.1 next to each such Sellers
name.   Each Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority (or
other  appropriate power and authority based on the structure of such
Seller) to own,  lease, and operate its properties, to carry on its business
in the places where  such properties are now owned, leased, or operated and
such business is now  conducted, and to execute, deliver, and perform this
Agreement and the  documents contemplated hereby (the "Ancillary Documents")
according to their  respective terms and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and  thereby. Each Seller is duly qualified  and in
good standing in each jurisdiction listed on Schedule 3.1 next to each  such
Sellers name, which are all jurisdictions in which such qualification
is  required. Except as set forth on  Schedule 3.1, no Seller is a
participant in any joint venture, partnership or  similar relationship with
any other Person with respect to any part of the  business or the operations
of the Stations or any of the Assets.

    



    

3.2. **_Authorization  and Binding Obligation_**. The execution, delivery,
and performance of  this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by each
Seller have been duly  authorized by all necessary corporate or other
required action on the part of  each Seller. This Agreement has been  duly
executed and delivered by each Seller and constitutes, and each
Ancillary  Document when duly executed and delivered by each Seller will
constitute, its  legal, valid, and binding obligation, enforceable against
it in accordance with  its terms except in each case as such enforceability
may be affected by  bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally  and by judicial discretion in the enforcement
of equitable remedies.

    



    

3.3. **_Absence  of Conflicting Agreements; Consents_**. Subject to
obtaining the Consents which are  listed on Schedule 3.3, the execution,
delivery, and performance by each Seller  of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (with or without the giving of  notice, the lapse of
time, or both): (a) do not require the consent of any  third party; (b) will
not conflict with any provision of the Articles of  Incorporation, Bylaws,
or other organizational documents of Sellers; (c) will  not conflict with,
result in a breach of, or constitute a material default  under any law,
judgment, order, ordinance, injunction, decree, rule,  regulation, or ruling
of any court or governmental instrumentality; (d) will  not conflict with,
constitute grounds for termination of, result in a breach  of, constitute a
default under, or accelerate or permit the acceleration of any  performance
required by the terms of, any   material agreement, instrument, license, or
permit to which any Seller  is a party or by which any Seller may be bound
legally; and (e) will not create  any claim, liability, mortgage,

    



    

14

              
      



    

lien, pledge, condition,  charge, or encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) of any nature whatsoever  upon any of the Assets. Except for
the  FCC Consent provided for in Section 6.1, the filings required
by  Hart-Scott-Rodino provided for in Section 6.2 and the other Consents
described  in Schedule 3.3, no consent, approval, permit, or authorization
of, declaration  to, or filing with any governmental or regulatory authority
or any other third  party is required to consummate this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

    



    

3.4. **_Governmental Licenses_**. Schedule 3.4 includes a true and
complete  list of the FCC Licenses and any other material Licenses. Sellers
have made available to Buyer true  and complete copies of the Licenses
(including any amendments and other modifications  thereto). The Licenses
have been validly  issued, and each Seller, as listed on Schedule 3.4, is
the authorized legal  holder of the Licenses and those FCC Licenses listed
on Schedule 3.4, as  applicable. The Licenses and the FCC  Licenses
comprise all of the material licenses, permits, and other  authorizations
required from any governmental or regulatory authority for the  lawful
conduct in of the business and operations of the Stations in the manner  and
to the full extent they are now conducted and, except as
otherwise  disclosed on Schedule 3.4, none of the Licenses is subject to any
unusual or  special restriction or condition that could reasonably be
expected to limit  materially the full operation of the Stations as now
operated. The FCC Licenses are in full force and  effect, are valid for the
balance of the current license term, are unimpaired  by any acts or
omissions of Sellers or their Affiliates, and are free and clear  of any
restrictions which might limit the full operation of the Stations in
the  manner and to the full extent as they are now operated (other than
restrictions  under the terms of the licenses themselves or applicable to
the television  broadcast industry generally). Sellers  have fulfilled and
performed in all material respects their respective  obligations under each
of the Licenses, and no event has occurred or condition  or state of facts
exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or  both, would
constitute a material breach or default under any such  License. Sellers
have not received any  written notice of any violation of the Licenses, the
Communications Act or the  rules and regulations thereunder relating to the
Stations. Except as listed on Schedule 3.4 hereto,  there are no
applications, proceedings, or complaints pending or, to Sellers  Knowledge,
threatened to revoke, cancel, rescind, modify or refuse to renew in  the
ordinary course of the Licenses or which may have an adverse effect on
the  business or operation of the Stations (other than rulemaking
proceedings that  apply to the television broadcasting industry generally).
Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.4 hereto,  Sellers are not aware of any
reason why any of the FCC Licenses might not be  renewed in the ordinary
course for a full term without material qualifications  or of any reason why
any of the FCC Licenses might be revoked. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4,
to  Sellers Knowledge, there are no facts relating to Sellers which, under
the  Communications Act or the existing rules of the FCC that would
reasonably be  expected to (a) disqualify Sellers from assigning the FCC
Licenses to Buyer;  (b) cause the filing of any objection to the assignment
of the FCC Licenses to  Buyer; (c) lead to any material delay in the
processing by the FCC of the  applications for such assignment; (d) lead to
a delay in the termination of the  waiting period required by Hart-Scott-
Rodino; (e) lead to the denial by the FCC  of a request by Buyer for
authority to operate WTTK as a satellite of WTTV  pursuant to Note 5 to 47
C.F.R. sec. 73.3555; or (f) disqualify any Seller from  consummating the

    



    

15

              
      



    

transactions contemplated herein within  the times contemplated herein.
An  appropriate public inspection file for each Station is maintained at
such  Stations studio in accordance with FCC rules and regulations. Except
as set forth on Schedule 3.4, access  to the Stations transmission
facilities is restricted in accordance with the  policies, rules and
regulations of the FCC.

    



    

3.5. **_Real Property_**. (a) Schedule 3.5 contains a complete
description  of all Real Property Interests (including street address,
owner, and Sellers  use thereof). The Real Property  Interests listed on
Schedule 3.5 comprise all interests in real property  necessary to conduct
the business and operations of the Stations as now  conducted. Except as
described on  Schedule 3.5, Sellers have good fee simple title to all fee
estates included in  the Real Property Interests and good title to all other
Real Property  Interests, in each case free and clear of all liens,
mortgages, pledges,  covenants, easements, restrictions, encroachments,
leases, charges, and other  claims and encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances. Each leasehold or subleasehold interest  included on Schedule
3.5 is legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full  force and effect.
Neither the Seller party thereto nor, to Sellers Knowledge,  any other
party thereto, is in default, violation, or breach under any lease
or  sublease, and no event has occurred and is continuing that constitutes
(with  notice or passage of time or both) a default, violation, or
breach  thereunder. Sellers have not received  any notice of a default,
offset, or counterclaim under any lease or sublease  with respect to any of
the Real Property Interests. As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
Sellers enjoy  peaceful and undisturbed possession of the leased Real
Property Interests; and  so long as Sellers fulfill their obligations under
the lease therefor, Sellers  have enforceable rights to nondisturbance and
quiet enjoyment against its  lessor or sublessor and, to Sellers Knowledge,
except as set forth in Schedule  3.5, no third party holds any interest in
the leased premises with the right to  foreclose upon Sellers leasehold or
subleasehold interest. Sellers have legal and practical access to  all of
the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property, as applicable.

    



    

(b) To Sellers Knowledge, none of the  Real Property impermissibly
encroaches on any other buildings, structures or  improvements located on
adjoining real estate.   Except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 3.5, all
towers, guy anchors,  ground radials, and buildings and other improvements
included in the Assets  are, to Sellers Knowledge, located entirely on the
Owned Real Property or the  Leased Real Property, as applicable, listed in
Schedule 3.5.

    



    

(c) To Sellers Knowledge, all buildings,  structures, and improvements
included in the Assets are constructed in  conformity with, or are
"grandfathered" with respect to, all "setback" lines,  easements, and other
restrictions, or rights of record, or that have been  established by any
applicable building or safety code or zoning ordinance,  except in any case
for any of the foregoing which would not materially impair  the ability of
Sellers to own or operate the Stations or which would not  involve any
material cost or expense to cure or remedy. No utility lines serving the Real
Property  nor guy wires supporting any tower pass over the lands of others
except where  appropriate easements have been obtained.   All towers and
other structures on the Real Property are painted and  lighted in
accordance, in all material respects, with the requirements of
the  applicable Licenses, the FCC, the Federal Aviation Administration and
all  applicable requirements of federal, state and local law.

    



    

16

              
      



    

(d) All utilities that are required for  the full and complete occupancy and
use of the Real Property for the purposes  for which such properties are
presently being used by Sellers, including,  without limitation, electric,
water, sewer, telephone and similar services,  have been connected and are
in good working order. By the Closing Date, Sellers will have paid all charges
for such  utilities, including, without limitation, any "tie-in" charges or
connection  fees, except for those charges that will not become due until
after the Closing  Date and that are to be prorated between pursuant to
Section 2.3.

    



    

(e) All Owned Real Property and Leased  Real Property (including the
improvements thereon) (i) is in good condition and  repair consistent with
its current use, (ii) is available for immediate use in  the conduct of the
business and operations of the Stations, and (iii) complies  in all material
respects with all Licenses, all applicable material building or  zoning
codes and the regulations, codes, ordinances and statutes of
any  governmental authority having jurisdiction, except to the extent that
the  current use by Sellers, while permitted, constitutes or would
constitute a  "nonconforming use" under current zoning or land use
regulations.

    



    

(f) Each of the towers located on the  Real Property can structurally
support all of the equipment used in connection  therewith in accordance
with law, governmental approvals and sound engineering  practices.

    



    

(g) No eminent domain or condemnation  proceedings are pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened with respect to  any Real Property Interests.

    



    

3.6. **_Tangible  Personal Property_**. The Tangible Personal Property
(which is described in Schedule  3.6) comprises all material items of
tangible personal property, other than the  Excluded Tangible Personal
Property, necessary to conduct the business and  operations of the Stations
as now conducted and lists of such Tangible Personal  Property have been
provided to Buyer previously. Except as described in Schedule 3.6, Sellers own
and have good  title to each item of Tangible Personal Property and none of
the Tangible  Personal Property owned by Sellers is subject to any security
interest,  mortgage, pledge, conditional sales agreement, or other lien or
encumbrance,  except for Permitted Encumbrances. With  allowance for
normal repairs, maintenance, wear and obsolescence, each material  item of
Tangible Personal Property is in good operating condition and repair  and is
available for immediate use in the business and operations of the  Stations.
All material items of  transmitting and studio equipment included in the
Tangible Personal Property  (a) have been maintained in a manner consistent
with generally accepted  standards of good engineering and industry
practices, and (b) will permit the  Stations to operate in accordance with
the material terms of the FCC Licenses  and the rules and regulations of the
FCC and in all material respects with all  other applicable federal, state
and local statutes, ordinances, rules and  regulations.

    



    

3.7. **_Contracts_**. Schedule 3.7 is a true and complete list of  all
Contracts which either (a) have a remaining term (after taking into
account  any cancellation rights of Sellers) of more than nine months after
the date  hereof, or (b) could involve payments or other consideration in
excess of  Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) in any calendar year after
the date  hereof, except

    



    

17

              
      



    

Contracts with  advertisers for production or the sale of advertising time
on the Stations for  cash that may be canceled by Sellers without premium or
penalty on not more  than ninety (90) days notice. Sellers  have
delivered or made available to Buyer true and complete copies of
all  written Assumed Contracts and true and complete descriptions of all
oral  Assumed Contracts which are required to be set forth on Schedule 3.7
(including  any amendments and other modifications to such Assumed
Contracts). Other than the Contracts listed on Schedule  3.5 and Schedule
3.7, Sellers require no Contract, lease, or other agreement to  enable them
to carry on the business and operations of the Stations in all  material
respects as now conducted. All  of the Contracts are in full force and
effect and are valid, binding, and  enforceable in accordance with their
terms except as the enforceability of such  Contracts may be affected by
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting  creditors rights
generally and by judicial discretion in the enforcement of  equitable
remedies. Neither the Seller  party thereto nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any
other party thereto, is in, or  alleged to be in, default, violation, or
breach in any material respect under  any Contract, and no event has
occurred and no condition or state of fact exists  that with notice or
passage of time or both would constitute a default,  violation, or breach in
any material respect thereunder. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.7,
other  than in the ordinary course of business, to Sellers Knowledge, no
party to any  Contract has any intention to (a) terminate such Contract or
amend the terms  thereof, (b) refuse to renew the Contract upon expiration
of its term, or (c)  renew the Contract upon expiration only on terms and
conditions that are  materially more onerous than those now existing. Except
for the need to obtain the Consents listed on Schedule  3.3, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will  not
affect the validity, enforceability, or continuation of any of
the  Contracts.

    



    

3.8. **_Intangibles_**. Schedule 3.8 is a true and complete list of  all
intangible assets or rights   (exclusive of Licenses listed in Schedule 3.4)
that are required to  conduct the business and operations of the Stations as
now conducted. Sellers have provided or made available to  Buyer copies of
all documents establishing or evidencing the Intangibles listed  on Schedule
3.8. Sellers own or have a  valid license to use all of the Intangibles
listed on Schedule 3.8 free and  clear of all claims, liabilities,
mortgages, liens, pledges, conditions,  charges or encumbrances, except for
Permitted Encumbrances. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, Sellers  are
not and have not received any notice or demand alleging that Sellers
are  infringing upon or otherwise acting adversely to any trademarks, trade
names,  call letters, service marks, service names, copyrights, patents,
patent  applications, know-how, methods, or processes owned by any other
Person, and  there is no claim or action pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened with  respect thereto. To Sellers Knowledge,  except as set
forth on Schedule 3.8, no other Person is infringing upon  Sellers rights
or ownership interests in the Intangibles. None of the Sellers has sold
licensed or  otherwise disposed of any of the Intangibles to any Person, and
none of the  Sellers has agreed to indemnify any Person for any patent,
trademark, copyright  or other intellectual property infringement relating
to the Intangibles or the  Stations.

    



    

3.9. **_Title to Assets_**. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.5 or
3.6,  Sellers have, and will transfer to Buyer upon consummation of this
Agreement,  good and marketable title to the Assets subject to no mortgages,

3.10. **_Financial  Statements_**.   Sellers have furnished Buyer with
true and complete copies of unaudited  financial statements of the Stations
containing a balance sheet and statement  of income, as, at, and for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and an  unaudited balance sheet and
statement of income as at and for the three (3)  months ended March 31, 2002
(the "Balance **** Sheet Date") (collectively,  the "Financial Statements").
Except as  disclosed on Schedule 3.10 and with respect to the March 31, 2002
interim  Financial Statements, for the absence of footnotes and certain year
end  adjustments, the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with  generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied,
accurately  reflect the books, records, and accounts of Sellers and present
fairly and  accurately the financial condition of the Stations as at their
respective dates  and the results of operations for the periods then ended.
None of the Financial Statements understate  in any material respect the
normal and customary costs and expenses of  conducting the business or
operations of the Stations or overstate in any  material respect the revenue
generated by the business and operations of the  Stations, in either case as
such business or operations are currently  conducted, or are otherwise
materially misleading regarding the operations of  the Stations. Except as
reflected in  such Financial Statements or otherwise disclosed to Buyer in
writing, no event  has occurred since the Balance Sheet Date that would make
the March 31, 2002  interim Financial Statements misleading in any material
respect as of the date  hereof.

    



    

3.11. **_Taxes_**. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11,  Sellers have filed
or caused to be filed all Tax Returns that are required to  be filed with
respect to their ownership and operation of the Stations and have  paid or
caused to be paid all Taxes shown on those returns or on any Tax  assessment
received by them to the extent that such Taxes have become due, or  have set
aside on their books adequate reserves (segregated to the extent  required
by generally accepted accounting principles) with respect  thereto. All
monies required to be  withheld by Sellers from employees of the Stations
for income Taxes, social  security and other payroll Taxes have been
collected or withheld, and either  paid to the respective governmental
authorities or set aside in an account or  accounts for such purpose. There
are no  legal, administrative, or other Tax proceedings presently pending
and, to  Sellers Knowledge, there are no grounds existing pursuant to which
Sellers are  or could be made liable for any Taxes, the liability for which
could extend to  Buyer as transferee of the business of the Stations. There
is no liability for Taxes that could give rise to a lien on  the Assets in
the hands of the Buyer, excepting Permitted Encumbrances.

    



    

3.12. **_Insurance_**. Schedule 3.12 is a true and complete list of  all
insurance policies of or covering the Assets or the Stations. All policies of
insurance listed in Schedule  3.12 are in full force and effect as of the

Sellers or the Stations has been canceled by the insurer  due to
circumstances relating specifically to the Sellers or the Stations
and,  except as set forth on Schedule 3.12, no application of Sellers for
insurance  has been rejected by any insurer.

    



    

3.13. **_Reports_**. All returns, reports, and statements that  the Stations
are currently required to file with the FCC or Federal
Aviation  Administration have been filed, and all reporting

complied with in all material  respects. All of such returns,
reports,  and statements, as filed, satisfy all applicable legal
requirements.

contains a true and complete list of all employee benefit plans
or  arrangements covering the employees employed at the Stations (the

or required to be contributed to by any Seller or  under which any Seller
has any liability relating to Employees (collectively,  "Benefit ****
Arrangements"). Sellers maintain no other severance policies  other than
those set forth on Schedule 3.14 and such policy set forth in  Schedule 3.14
does not specifically provide that a change of control or similar  event, in
and of itself, constitutes termination of any employee which would  give
rise to any severance payment thereunder and Sellers, except as set
forth  on Schedule 3.14, have not maintained a practice of paying severance
to  employees upon a change of control or similar event.

    



    

(b) **_Pension Plans_**. Sellers do not sponsor, maintain, or  contribute to

complies and has been maintained both as to form  and in operation in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the  requirements prescribed
by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations that  are applicable to such

therefrom, if an attempted assignment or  transfer thereof, without the
consent of a third party thereto would constitute  a breach thereof or in
any way adversely affect the rights of the Buyer  thereunder. If such
consent (a  "Deferred Consent") is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment or transfer  thereof would be ineffective or would affect the
rights thereunder so that the  Buyer would not receive all such rights, then
(i) Sellers and Buyer will  cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain
such Deferred Consents as soon  as practicable; provided that neither
Sellers nor Buyer shall have any  obligation (y) to expend funds to obtain
any Deferred Consent, other than  ministerial processing fees, and out-of-
pocket expenses to its attorney or  other agents incurred in connection with
obtaining any Deferred Consent, or (z)  to agree to any adverse change in
any License or Assumed Contract in order to  obtain a Deferred Consent, and
(ii) after the Closing, until such Deferred  Consent is obtained, Sellers
and Buyer will cooperate in all reasonable  respects to enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing or  subcontracting if permitted) to
provide to the parties the economic and  operational equivalent of obtaining
such Deferred Consent and assigning or transferring such Contract  (with the
Buyer responsible for the economic equivalent of all liabilities
and  obligations thereunder), including enforcement for the benefit of the
Buyer of  all claims or rights arising thereunder, and the performance by
the Buyer of  the obligations thereunder on a basis consistent with past
practices.

    



    

5.12. **_Books and  Records_** **.** Sellers shall maintain their books
and  records in accordance with past practices.

    



    

5.13. **_Notification_** **.**   Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in
writing of (i) any material  developments with respect to the business or
operations of the Stations, (ii)  any material change in any of the
information contained in the representations  and warranties contained in
Section 3 of this Agreement, (iii) any action, suit  or proceeding
instituted or threatened in writing to restrain, prohibit or  otherwise
challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this  Agreement,
(iv) any lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation threatened in  writing,
brought, asserted in writing or commenced relating to the Assets or  the
business or operations of the Stations, (v) any written notice from
any  third Person alleging that the consent of such third Person is or may
be  required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and  (vi) any default under any Assumed Contract of which Sellers
have Knowledge or  event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become such a default  on or prior to the Closing Date and of which any
Seller has Knowledge.

    



    

5.14. **_Financial  Information_** **.** Sellers shall furnish to Buyer
within thirty  (30) calendar days after the end of each month ending between
the date of this  Agreement and the Closing Date a

    



    

28

              
      



    

balance sheet and a  statement of income and expense for the month just
ended and such other  financial information (including information on
payables and receivables) as  Buyer may reasonably request. All  financial
information delivered by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to this Section  5.14
shall be prepared from the books and records of Sellers in accordance
with  generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied;
shall  accurately reflect the books, records, and accounts of the Stations;
shall be  complete and correct in all material respects; and shall present
fairly the financial  condition of the Stations as at its respective dates
and the results of  operations for the periods then ended.

    



    

5.15. **_Compliance  with Laws_** **.** Sellers shall comply in all
material  respects with all Laws.

    



    

5.16. **_Preservation  of Business_** **.** Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable  efforts consistent with past practices to preserve the business
and  organization of each Station and to keep available to each Station its
present  employees, and to preserve the audience of the Stations and each
Stations  present relationships with suppliers, advertisers, and others
having business  relations with it. Sellers shall  refrain from taking any
action which would render any representation or  warranty contained in
Section 3 of this Agreement inaccurate in any material respect  as of the
Closing Date.

    



    

5.17. **_Normal Operations_** **.**   Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including,  without limitation, Section 5.1), prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall  carry on the business and activities of the
Stations, including, without  limitation, promotional activities, the sale
of advertising time, entering into  other Contracts and agreements,
purchasing and scheduling programming,  performing research, and operating
in all material respects in accordance with  existing budgets which have
heretofore been made available to Buyer and past  practice.

    



    

 ** _SECTION 6: SPECIAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_**

    



    

6.1. **_FCC  Consent_** **.**

    



    

(a) The exchange and  transfer of the Assets as contemplated by this
Agreement is subject to the  prior consent and approval of the FCC.

    



    

(b) Sellers and Buyer  shall prepare and within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this  Agreement shall file with the FCC an appropriate
application for FCC  Consent. The parties shall thereafter  prosecute the
application with all reasonable diligence and otherwise use
their  respective best efforts to obtain a grant of the application as
expeditiously  as practicable. Each party agrees to  comply with any
condition imposed on it by the FCC Consent, except that no  party shall be
required to comply with a condition if (i) the condition was  imposed on it
as the result of a circumstance, the existence of which does not  constitute
a breach by that party of any of its representations, warranties,
or  covenants hereunder, and (ii) compliance with the condition would have
a  material adverse effect upon it.   Further, Buyer shall not be required
to comply with any condition that  would require it to divest WTTK, WTTV, or
any other station in the Indianapolis,  Indiana market whose FCC License
Buyer holds as of the date of this Agreement.

    



    



    

29

              
      



    

Buyer and Sellers shall  oppose any petitions to deny or other objections
filed with respect to the  application for the FCC Consent and any requests
for reconsideration or  judicial review of the FCC Consent.

    



    

(c) Buyer shall prepare and submit as  part of the application to the FCC
for FCC Consent a request for an appropriate  waiver of the FCCs rules to
permit Buyer to operate WTTK as a satellite of  WTTV pursuant to Note 5 to
47 C.F.R. sec. 73.3555, together with necessary and  sufficient materials
supporting such a request. In connection with the waiver request, Buyer shall
neither  propose nor request any changes to the operation of either WTTK or
WTTV.

    



    

(d) If the Closing shall not have  occurred for any reason within the
original effective period of the FCC Consent  and neither party shall have
terminated this Agreement under Section 9, the  parties shall jointly
request an extension of the effective period of the FCC  Consent. No
extension of the effective  period of the FCC Consent shall limit the
exercise by either party of its right  to terminate the Agreement under
Section 9.

    



    

6.2. **_Hart-Scott-Rodino_** **.**

    



    

(a) Within ten (10)  Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, Sellers and Buyer  shall complete any filing that may be required
pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino  (each an "HSR Filing"). Sellers and  Buyer
shall diligently take, or fully cooperate in the taking of, all
necessary  and proper steps and provide any additional information
reasonably requested in  order to comply with the requirements of Hart-
Scott-Rodino; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that, in the event Sellers or Buyer
receive a "second request" for information  from either the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice with  respect to the HSR Filing,
Sellers may refuse to comply with such "second  request". Buyer shall in no
event be  obligated to comply with any order made or condition imposed by
the Department  of Justice or the FTC that Buyer divest any assets or
businesses, including any  businesses or assets of the Stations, or to hold
separate any such assets or  businesses pending such divestiture.

    



    

(b) In the event Sellers refuse to comply  with such "second request" and
Buyer terminates this Agreement as provided in  Section 9.3(d) hereof,
Sellers shall pay to Buyer within two (2) Business Days  after such
termination in immediately available funds the amount of Two Million  Eight
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,800,000.00) (the "HSR Termination Fee").

    



    

(c) In the event Sellers agree to comply  with such "second request,"
Sellers shall not be obligated to pay to Buyer the  HSR Termination Fee, and
Buyer shall agree to assume at the Effective Time the  severance agreements
which Sellers determine to enter into with those employees  (or their
replacements) as set forth on Schedule 6.2(c) hereof; _provided_   such
severance agreements shall entitle such employee to receive not more
than  the amounts set forth on Schedule 6.2(c); such entitlement to arise
with respect  to any such employee only if such employee is terminated by
Buyer within one  year following the Effective Time

    



    

30

              
      



    

6.3. **_Risk of Loss_** **.**   The risk of any loss, damage, impairment,
confiscation, or condemnation  of any of the Assets of Sellers for any cause
whatsoever shall be borne by  Sellers at all times prior to the Closing.
  In the event of loss or damage prior to the Closing Date (an "Event
of  Loss"), Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fix,
restore, or  replace such loss, damage, impairment, confiscation, or
condemnation to its  former operational condition. If such  repair and
replacement cannot be accomplished by the scheduled Closing Date,  the
Closing Date may be postponed in order for Sellers to undertake such
repair  or replacement and, in such event, Buyer may elect by written notice
to  Sellers: (i) to postpone the Closing  until such time as the Assets
which are subject to the Event of Loss have been  restored to their
condition immediately prior to the Event of Loss; or (ii) to  consummate the
Closing on the scheduled Closing Date and accept all of the  Assets as is,
in which event, each Seller shall assign to Buyer at the Closing  all of its
rights under any insurance policies and all insurance proceeds  covering the
Event of Loss (less amounts due to the assigning party for repairs  or
replacements of the property prior to Closing).

    



    

6.4. **_Confidentiality_** **.** Except as necessary for the
consummation  of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including
Buyers obtaining  of financing related hereto, and except as and to the
extent required by law or  the rules of any stock exchange, each party will
keep confidential any  information obtained from the other party in
connection with the transactions  specifically contemplated by this
Agreement.   If this Agreement is terminated, each party will return to the
other  party all information obtained by the receiving party from the other
party in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the  contrary in this Section 6.4, the
Confidentiality Agreement between Sellers and  Buyer dated November 21, 2001
shall survive the execution of this Agreement and  remain in effect until
terminated in accordance with its terms. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to prevent its employees (and the employees of its
Affiliates) from  discussing the pending sale or any actions which may be
taken after the Closing  as a result of the sale; _provided_ such employees
shall be permitted to  perform their job functions in the ordinary course
consistent with past  practice.

    



    

6.5. **_Cooperation_** **.**   Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate
with each other and their  respective counsel and accountants in connection
with any actions required to  be taken as part of their respective
obligations under this Agreement; and in  connection with any litigation
after the Closing Date which relates to the  Stations for periods prior to
the Effective Time. Buyer and Sellers shall execute such other documents as
may be  reasonably necessary and desirable to the implementation and
consummation of  this Agreement and otherwise use their commercially
reasonable efforts to  consummate the transaction contemplated hereby and to
fulfill their obligations  under this Agreement. Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, no party hereto shall have any obligation (a) to expend funds
to  obtain any of the Consents, other than ministerial processing fees, and
out-of-pocket  expenses to such partys attorneys or other agents incurred
in connection with  obtaining such consents, or (b) to agree to any adverse
change in any License  or Assumed Contract in order to obtain a Consent
required with respect thereto.

    



    

31

              
      



    

6.6. **_Control  of the Stations_** **.** Notwithstanding  anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Closing shall not be
consummated  prior to the grant by the FCC of the FCC Consent. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that at all times commencing on the  date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any of its  employees, agents
or representatives, directly or indirectly, shall, or have  any right to,
control, direct, or otherwise supervise, or attempt to control,  direct or
otherwise supervise any of the management or operations of the  Stations, it
being understood that the operation, management, control and  supervision of
all programs, equipment, operations and other activities of the  Stations
shall be the sole responsibility, and at all times prior to the  Closing
Date remain within the complete control and discretion, of Sellers,  subject
to the terms of Section 5 of this Agreement.

    



    

6.7. **_Accounts  Receivable_** **.**

    



    

(a) As soon as  practicable after the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer a complete and  detailed list of all the Accounts Receivable.
  During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
one  hundred fiftieth (150th) day after the Closing Date (the "Collection
Period"),  Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, as Sellers
agent, to collect  the Accounts Receivable in the usual and ordinary course
of business, using the  Stations credit, sales, and other appropriate
personnel in accordance with  customary practices which may include referral
to a collection agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall  not be
required to institute legal proceedings on Sellers behalf to enforce  the
collection of any Accounts Receivable.   Buyer shall not adjust any Accounts
Receivable or grant credit without  Sellers written consent, and Buyer
shall not pledge, secure, or otherwise  encumber such Accounts Receivable or
the proceeds therefrom, other than to the  extent such pledge, security or
encumbrance arises without any further action  not specifically required by
Buyer under Buyers or its Affiliates financing  instruments or facilities
in the ordinary course of business. On or before the twelfth (12th) Business
Day  after the end of each calendar month during the Collection Period,
Buyer shall remit  to Sellers collections received by Buyer with respect to
the Accounts  Receivable, together with a report of all amounts collected
with respect to the  Accounts Receivable during, as the case may be, the
period from the Closing or  the beginning of such month through the end of
such month, less any reasonable  sales commissions or collection costs paid
by Buyer in the ordinary course of  its business during the respective
periods with respect to those Accounts  Receivable, plus any sales
commission chargebacks taken by Buyer to the extent  such sales commissions
were previously deducted in determining the amount to be  paid to Sellers
hereunder.

    



    

(b) Any payments received by Buyer during  the Collection Period from any
Person that is an account debtor with respect to  any account disclosed in
the list of Accounts Receivable delivered by Sellers  to Buyer shall be
applied first to the invoice designated by the account debtor  and, if none,
such payment shall be applied to the oldest account which is not  disputed.
Buyer shall incur no  liability to Sellers for any uncollected account,
other than as a result of  Buyers breach of its obligations under this
Section 6.7, in which case such  liability shall not exceed the amount of
the disputed Accounts Receivable. Prior to the end of the Collection
Period,  neither Sellers, nor any agent of Sellers, shall make any direct
solicitation  of the account

    



    

32

              
      



    

debtors for payment. After the end of the Collection Period,  Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers all information for the accounts that
remain  uncollected, and Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to
assist and  participate with Buyer in the collection of the unpaid Accounts
Receivable.

    



    

(c) At the end of the Collection Period,  Buyer shall return to Sellers all
files concerning the collection or attempts  to collect the Accounts
Receivable, and Buyers responsibility for the  collection of the Accounts
Receivable shall cease.

    



    

6.8. **_Tax-Free  Exchange and Allocation of Purchase Price_** **.**

    



    

(a) Sellers acknowledge  that Buyer may desire to make a qualified tax-
deferred exchange of certain  other property of like kind for the Assets,
pursuant to and in accordance with  Section 1031 of the Code. Sellers
shall  cooperate, in good faith, as reasonably requested by Buyer, in
enabling Buyer  to effectuate such an exchange. Buyer  expressly reserves
the right to assign its rights, but not its obligations,  under this
Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" as defined in Treasury  Regulation
Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4). Sellers obligation to cooperate with  Buyer in
order to enable Buyer to effectuate a qualified, tax-deferred exchange  is
subject to the following conditions:

    



    

(i) All  of Sellers rights and all of Buyers obligations to Sellers in
respect of all  other provisions of this Agreement shall not be adversely
affected by any such  exchange, whether or not consummated; and

    



    

(ii) Sellers  shall not in any way be liable to Buyer or any other party
whatsoever for any  failure of Buyers proposed transaction to qualify for
the desired tax-deferred  treatment.

    



    

(iii) Sellers  shall not bear any cost, expense or liability as a result of
any such  tax-deferred exchange and Buyer shall indemnify Sellers from and
against any  such costs, expenses or liabilities.

    



    

(b) If  at any time Buyer determines not to effectuate the purchase of the
Assets as  part of a tax-deferred exchange, it shall promptly notify Sellers
of this fact.  Within sixty (60) days following such notification, Sellers
and Buyer shall  negotiate and draft a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_
") allocating  the consideration paid to Sellers (including the Purchase
Price and any  adjustments thereto and any other amounts that are properly
taken into account  for Tax purposes as part of the consideration for the
purchase of the Assets)  among the Assets. The Allocation  Schedule shall
be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section  1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyer and Sellers shall prepare
mutually  satisfactory Form(s) 8594 reflecting the Allocation Schedule and
such other  information as is required and shall each file such Form(s) with
their  respective federal income tax returns for the tax year in which the
Closing  occurs. If Sellers and Buyer are unable  to agree on an
Allocation Schedule, Sellers and Buyer agree to retain a  nationally
recognized appraisal firm experienced in valuing television  broadcast
properties to appraise the Assets. The appraisal firm shall perform

    



    

33

              
      



    

such appraisal promptly.   Sellers and Buyer shall each pay one-half (1/2)
of the costs of such  appraisal.

    



    

6.9. **_Access to Books and Records_** **.**   To the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, Sellers shall provide Buyer  access and the right to
copy from and after the Closing Date any books and  records relating to the
Assets, but not included in the Assets. To the extent reasonably requested
by  Sellers, Buyer shall provide Sellers access and the right to copy from
and  after the Closing Date any books and records relating to the Assets
that are  included in the Assets. Buyer and  Sellers shall each retain any
such books and records for a period of three (3)  years (or such longer
period as may be required by law or government  regulation) following the
Closing Date.

    



    

6.10. **_Employee  Matters_** **.**

    



    

(a) Upon consummation of  the Closing hereunder, except for those Employees
who are listed on Schedule  6.10 and designated by Sellers within sixty (60)
days after the date hereof who  shall be retained by Sellers or affiliates
thereof, Buyer shall offer  employment to each of the Employees of the
Stations (including those on leave  of absence, whether short-term, family,
maternity, short-term disability, paid,  unpaid or other and those hired
after the date hereof in the ordinary course of  business, to the extent not
specifically prohibited by the provisions of this  Agreement, if any), other
than those Employees listed on Schedule 6.10 and  designated by Buyer within
sixty (60) days after the date hereof (it being  understood that any
severance liability incurred by Sellers as a result of  Buyer not offering
employment to Employees who are so designated shall be  reimbursed by
Buyer), at a salary and position comparable to similarly situated  employees
of Buyer and at the place of employment as held by each such
employee  immediately prior to the Closing Date (such employees who are
given such offers  of employment are referred to herein as the "Transferred
**** Employees").

    



    

(b) Except as provided otherwise in this  Section 6.10, Sellers shall pay,
discharge, and be responsible for (i) all  salary and wages arising out of
or relating to the employment of the Employees  prior to the Closing Date,
and (ii) any employee benefits arising under the  Benefit Plans or Benefit
Arrangements of Sellers and their Affiliates during the  period prior to the
Closing Date. From  and after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer shall pay,
discharge, and be  responsible for all salary, wages, and benefits
(including vacation pay and  sick leave pay) arising out of or relating to
the employment of the Transferred  Employees by Buyer on and after the
Closing Date and (ii) Buyer shall be  responsible for all severance
liabilities (if any) and all COBRA liabilities  (if any) for any of the
Transferred Employees of the Stations that are (y)  terminated on or after
the Closing Date, and (z) terminated as a result of the  consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby, and (v) Sellers shall be  responsible for
all COBRA liabilities for any of the COBRA Employees.

    



    

(c) Buyer shall cause all Transferred  Employees as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date to be eligible to  participate in all "employee
welfare benefit plans" and "employee pension  benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively) of  Buyer

    



    

34

              
      



    

(other than the Tribune  Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan) in which
similarly situated employees of  Buyer are generally eligible to
participate; provided, however, that all  Transferred Employees and, to the
extent elected by any Transferred Employee,  their spouses and dependents
shall be eligible for health insurance coverage  immediately after the
Closing Date (and shall not be excluded from coverage on  account of any
pre-existing condition) to the extent provided under such plans  with
respect to Transferred Employees.

    



    

(d) For purposes of any length of service  requirements, waiting period,
vesting periods, or differential benefits based  on length of service in any
such plan (but not for purposes of benefit  accruals, except to the extent
Buyer has received a credit under Section  2.3(b)) for which a Transferred
Employee may be eligible after the Closing,  Buyer shall ensure that, to the
extent permitted by law, service by such  Transferred Employee with Sellers,
any Affiliate of Sellers, or any prior owner  of the Stations shall be
deemed to have been service with the Buyer; provided  that Sellers shall
provide access to such information regarding the Transferred  Employees as
provided under Section 6.9 hereof. In addition, Buyer shall ensure that each
Transferred Employee  receives credit under any welfare benefit plan of
Buyer for any deductibles or  co-payments paid by such Transferred Employee
and his or her dependents for the  calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs under a plan maintained by  Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers to
the extent allowable under any such  plan; provided that Sellers shall
provide access to such information regarding  the Transferred Employees as
provided by Section 6.9 hereof. Buyer shall grant credit to each
Transferred  Employee for all sick leave in accordance with the policies of
Buyer applicable  generally to its similarly situated employees after giving
effect to service  for Sellers, any Affiliate of Sellers, or any prior owner
of the Stations, as  service for Buyer. To the extent any  claim with
respect to accrued vacation leave or sick leave accrued after the  Effective
Time or accrued prior to the Effective Time to the extent Buyer
has  received a credit under Section 2.3(b) is lodged against Sellers with
respect  to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless  Sellers from and against any and all Losses, directly or
indirectly, as a  result of or based upon or arising from the same.

    



    

(e) As soon as practicable following the  Closing Date, Buyer shall make
available to the Transferred Employees Buyers  401(k) Plan. To the extent
requested by a Transferred Employee, Sellers shall  permit a rollover,
pursuant to Code Section 402(c), to Buyers 401(k) Plan, in  cash, of all of
the individual account balances of such Transferred Employee  under the
Sellers 401(k) Plan, including any outstanding plan participant
loan  receivables allocated to such accounts subject to compliance with
the  requirements of Buyers 401(k) Plan.

    



    

(f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that  Buyers obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.10 are in addition to, and not  in limitation of, Buyers
obligation to assume the employment contracts  included in the Assumed
Contracts.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to provide
employees of  Sellers with any rights under this Agreement, and no Person,
other than the  parties hereto, is or shall be entitled to bring any action
to enforce any  provision of this Agreement against any of the parties
hereto, and the covenants  and agreements set forth in this

    



    

35

              
      



    

Agreement shall be solely  for the benefit of, and shall only be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and  their respective successors and assigns as
permitted hereunder.

    



    

6.11. **_Public  Announcements_** **.** Sellers and Buyer shall consult with
each  other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any
public  statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  herein and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public  statement without the prior written consent of the other party,
which shall not  be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party
may, without the  prior written consent of the other party, issue such press
release or make such  public statement as may be required by Law or any
listing agreement with a  national securities exchange to which Sellers or
Buyer (or their respective  corporate parent) are a party if it has used all
commercially reasonable efforts  to consult with the other party and to
obtain such partys consent but has been  unable to do so in a timely
manner.

    



    

6.12. **_Disclosure  Schedules_** **.** Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that  Sellers shall not be liable for the failure of the Schedules to
be accurate  after the date hereof as a result of the operation of the
Stations after the  date hereof and prior to the Closing in accordance with
Section 5 of this  Agreement; provided that Sellers shall in good faith
attempt to provide Buyer  with prompt notice of such inaccuracy; but, in no
event, no later than the  Closing Date. The inclusion of any fact or item on
a Schedule referenced by a  particular section in this Agreement shall,
should the existence of the fact or  item or its contents be relevant to any
other section, be deemed to be  disclosed with respect to such other section
whether or not an explicit  cross-reference appears in the Schedules if such
relevance is readily apparent  from examination of such Schedules.

    



    

6.13. **_Bulk Sales Law_** **.**   Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Sellers, in connection with the  transactions contemplated hereby, with the
provisions of any applicable bulk  transfer laws.

    



    

6.14. **_Adverse  Developments_** **.** Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer
of any  unusual or materially adverse developments that occur prior to the
Closing with  respect to the Assets or the operation of the Stations;
provided, however, that  Sellers compliance with the disclosure
requirements of this Section 6.14 shall  not relieve Sellers of any
obligation with respect to any representation,  warranty, or covenant of
Sellers in this Agreement or relieve Buyer of any  obligation or duty
hereunder, waive any condition to Buyers obligations under  this Agreement,
or expand or enhance any right of Buyer hereunder.

    



    

6.15. **_Title Insurance_** **.**   Within ten (10) calendar days of the
date of this Agreement, Sellers  shall deliver to Buyer their current
available title insurance policies  relating to the Owned Real Property.
  Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in obtaining the commitment of
a  title insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Buyer agreeing to
issue to  Buyer, at standard rates, ALTA 1992 Form extended coverage title
insurance  policies with a zoning endorsement, insuring Buyers interest in
the Owned Real  Property (the "Title Commitment"). The  costs of the Title
Commitment and the policy to be issued pursuant to the Title  Commitment
shall be paid by Buyer.

    



    

36

              
      



    

6.16. **_Surveys_.**   Within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of this
Agreement, Sellers  shall deliver to Buyer, at Buyers expense, surveys of
the Owned Real Property  performed by surveyors reasonably acceptable to
Buyer sufficient to remove any  "survey exception" from the title insurance
policies to be issued pursuant to  the Title Commitments.

    



    

6.17. **_Environmental  Site Assessment_.**

    



    

(a) Within thirty (30)  days of the execution of this Agreement, Buyer may
obtain Phase I and Phase II  Environmental Assessments (provided that such
Phase II Environmental  Assessments do not unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Stations) at  Buyers expense for all of the Real Property
Interests (the "Environmental  Assessments"). In the event
any  Environmental Assessment discloses any conditions that require
remediation  under Environmental Laws or any potential that such conditions
may exist, Buyer  may conduct or have conducted at its expense additional
testing to confirm or  negate the existence of any such conditions.   If
any such Environmental Assessment or additional testing reflects
the  existence of any such conditions at any of the Real Property Interests,
Sellers  shall cause the conditions to be remedied as quickly as possible;
_provided_ ,   _however_ , that Sellers shall not be obligated to expend in
the aggregate  for all parcels of the Real Property Interests of the
Stations in excess of Two  Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) to effect
such remediation for all Real  Property Interests to be conveyed hereunder.
  In the event that such remedial action(s) does cost, in the
aggregate,  in excess of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), Sellers
may elect not  to take such remedial action. In such  event, to the extent
Closing has not already occurred, Buyer may require  Sellers to proceed to
the Closing of the Stations, in which case, Buyer shall  be responsible for
any expense regarding remediation in excess of Two Hundred  Thousand Dollars
($200,000.00) to the extent Buyer chooses to continue such  remediation;
alternatively, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and receive  return of the
Escrow Deposit (together with all interest or other proceeds from  the
investment thereof), and Sellers shall have no liability to Buyer. The cost of
completing the Environmental  Assessments shall be paid by Buyer.

    



    

(b) In the event  Sellers remediation of an Environmental Assessment is not
completed prior to  Closing and Buyer chooses to proceed with Closing,
Sellers shall continue to  remediate such Environmental Assessment to the
extent set forth in Section  6.17(a). Any amounts expended by Buyer  to
remediate any Environmental Assessment after the Closing shall be
credited  against the Threshold Amount in Section 10.5 to the extent Buyer
is entitled to  indemnification for any untrue representation or breach of
warranty pursuant to  Section 10.2(a).

10.3. **_Indemnification  by Buyer_** **.** Notwithstanding Closing, but
subject to  Section 10.1 and Section 10.5, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify

provided, however, that  in no event shall a waiver of any closing condition
by Sellers in accordance  with Section 7.2 limit Sellers right to
indemnification under this Section  10.3.

    



    

10.4. **_Procedure  for Indemnification_** **.** The procedure
for  indemnification shall be as follows:

    



    

(a) The party claiming indemnification  (the "Claimant") shall promptly give
notice to the party from which  indemnification is claimed (the
"Indemnifying **** Party") of any claim,  whether between the parties or
brought by a third party, specifying in  reasonable detail the factual basis
for the claim. If the claim relates to an action, suit, or proceeding filed by
a  third

    



    

45

              
      



    

party against Claimant,  such notice shall be given by Claimant within five
(5) Business Days after  written notice of such action, suit, or proceeding
was given to Claimant. The failure of any Claimant to give the  notice
required by this Section 10.4 shall not affect such Claimants rights  under
this Section 10 except to the extent such failure is actually
prejudicial  to the rights and obligations of the Indemnifying Party.

    



    

(b) With respect to claims solely between  the parties, following receipt of
notice from the Claimant of a claim, the  Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) calendar days to make such  investigation of the claim as the
Indemnifying Party deems necessary or  desirable. For the purposes of
such  investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the
Indemnifying Party  and its authorized representatives the information
relied upon by the Claimant to  substantiate the claim. If the
Claimant  and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of
the thirty  (30) day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof)
to the validity  and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
immediately pay to the  Claimant the full amount of the claim.   If the
Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do not agree within the  thirty (30) day
period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the  Claimant may
seek appropriate remedy at law or equity.

    



    

(c) With respect to any claim by a third  party as to which the Claimant is
entitled to indemnification under this  Agreement, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right at its own expense, to  participate in or assume
control of the defense of such claim, and the Claimant  shall cooperate
fully with the Indemnifying Party, subject to reimbursement for  actual out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of such a  request
for cooperation by the Indemnifying Party, provided, however,
that  Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense unless it
affirms in  writing its obligation to indemnify Claimant for any damages or
payments  incurred by Claimant with respect to such third-party claim. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control  of the defense of any
third-party claim, the Claimant shall have the right to  participate in the
defense of such claim at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect to  assume control or otherwise participate in the defense of any
third-party  claim, it shall be bound by the results obtained in good faith
by the Claimant  with respect to such claim.

    



    

(d) If a claim, whether between the  parties or by a third party, requires
immediate action, the parties will make  every effort to reach a decision
with respect thereto as expeditiously as  possible.

    



    

(e) Subject to Section  11.3, the indemnification rights provided in Section
10.2 and Section 10.3  shall extend to the members, partners, shareholders,
officers, directors,  employees, representatives, and affiliated entities of
any Claimant although  for the purpose of the procedures set forth in this

and through the  Claimant.

10.5. **_Certain  Limitations_** **.**

    



    

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
party shall indemnify or  otherwise be liable to the other party with
respect to any claim for any breach  of a representation or warranty, or for
the breach of any covenant contained in  this Agreement, unless notice of
the claim is given within the relevant  survival period specified in Section
10.1.

    



    

(b) Except as set forth  in the last sentence of this clause (b), but
notwithstanding anything else in  this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers
shall not be liable to Buyer in respect  of any indemnification hereunder
except to the extent that (i) the aggregate  amount of Buyers Loss exceeds
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) (the  "Threshold Amount"), and
then only to the extent Buyers Loss exceeds Two  Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000), and (ii) the aggregate amount of  Buyers Loss is less
than Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) (the "Indemnity Cap"). The
Threshold Amount and the Indemnity Cap  shall not limit Sellers
indemnification obligations under Sections 10.2(b) or  (c) herein.

    



    

(c) Notwithstanding any  other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall a party be  entitled to indemnification for such partys
incidental, consequential, or  punitive damages, regardless of the theory of
recovery. Each party hereto agrees to use reasonable  efforts to mitigate
any losses which form the basis for any claim for  indemnification
hereunder.

48

              
      



    

11.3. **_Benefit and Binding Effect_** **.**

    



    

Buyer may not  assign this Agreement to any other party without the consent
of Sellers, which  consent may be withheld by Sellers in their sole and
absolute discretion;  provided, Buyer shall have the right to assign all or
any portion of its rights  under this Agreement without Sellers consent to
(i) any entity under common  control with Buyer, (ii) a "qualified
intermediary" under Section 1031 of the  Code in accordance with Section 6.8
hereunder, or (iii) any lender or any agent  for such lender(s) for
collateral purposes only; provided, that no such  assignment (whether with
or without Sellers consent) shall relieve Buyer of  its obligations
hereunder. Sellers may  assign, combine, merge, or consolidate among
themselves and any Affiliate of  Sellers so long as Sellers or their
successors and assigns are bound by the  terms and conditions of this
Agreement in all respects as if such successors  and assigns were original
parties hereto, and such assignment, combination,  merger, or consolidation
does not have an adverse affect on Buyer. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and  inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and  permitted assigns. No Person, other  than the parties
hereto, is or shall be entitled to bring any action to enforce  any
provision of this Agreement against any of the parties hereto, and
the  covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall be solely
for the  benefit of, and shall be enforceable only by, the parties hereto or
their  respective successors and assigns as permitted hereunder.

    



    

11.4. **_Further  Assurances_** **.** The parties shall take any actions
and  execute any other documents that may be necessary or desirable to
the  implementation and consummation of this Agreement.

    



    

11.5. **_GOVERNING LAW_** **.**   THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED,
CONSTRUED, AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHOICE OF LAW  PROVISIONS THEREOF).

    



    

11.6. **_Entire  Agreement_** **.** This Agreement, the Schedules hereto,
and  all documents, certificates, and other documents to be delivered by the
parties  pursuant hereto, collectively, represent the entire understanding
and agreement  between Buyer and Sellers with respect to the subject matter
of this  Agreement. This Agreement supersedes  all prior negotiations
between the parties and cannot be amended, supplemented,  or changed except
by an agreement in writing duly executed by each of the  parties hereto.

    



    

11.7. **_Waiver of  Compliance; Consents_** **.** Except as
otherwise  provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to
comply with  any obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
or condition  herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits
thereof only by a  written instrument signed by the party granting such
waiver, but such waiver or  failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, representation,  warranty, covenant, agreement, or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of,  or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or
permits  consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent shall be
given in writing  in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver
of compliance as set  forth in this Section 11.7.

    



    

49

              
      



    

11.8. ** ****_Headings_** **.** The  headings of the sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement are  inserted for convenience only
and do not form a part or affect the meaning,  construction or scope
thereof.

    



    

11.9. **_Counterparts_** **.**   This Agreement may be signed in two or more
counterparts with the same  effect as if the signature on each counterpart
were upon the same instrument.

    



    

11.10. **_Specific Performance_** **.**   Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that
the Stations are of a special,  unique, and extraordinary character, and
that damages alone are an inadequate  remedy for a breach of this Agreement
by Sellers. Accordingly, as an alternative to termination of this
Agreement  under Section 9.3, if Buyer is not then in material default
hereunder, Buyer  shall be entitled, in the event of Sellers breach, to
enforce this Agreement  (subject to obtaining any required approval of the
FCC and the expiration or  termination of the waiting period under Hart-
Scott-Rodino) by a decree of  specific performance or injunctive relief
requiring Sellers to fulfill their  obligations under this Agreement.
Such  right of specific performance or injunctive relief shall be deemed an
election  of remedies by Buyer, and Buyer shall not be entitled to recover
damages or to  pursue any other remedies available to Buyer for Sellers
breach with respect  to which Buyer has been awarded specific performance or
injunctive relief. In any action to enforce specifically  Sellers
obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement,  Sellers shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy
at law or in  equity and any requirement that Buyer prove actual damages.

**_Re:_**

      |   

**_Asset Purchase   Agreement, dated as of April 18, 2002, by and among
Sinclair Broadcast Group,   Inc., Sinclair Communications, Inc., Sinclair
Media II, Inc., SCI-Indiana   Licensee, LLC and Tribune Broadcasting
Company_**

      
---|---|--- 
      



    

Gentlemen:

    



    

We have acted as counsel to Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.,  Sinclair
Communications, Inc., and Sinclair Media II, Inc., each a Maryland corporation
(collectively,  referred to herein as "Maryland Corporate Sellers"), and
SCI-Indiana  Licensee, LLC a Maryland limited liability company (referred to
herein as the "Maryland LLC Seller") (the Maryland  Corporate Sellers and
Maryland LLC Seller are collectively referred to herein  as "Sellers") in
connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain  Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 18, 2002, (the "Asset
Purchase  Agreement"), by and between Sellers and Buyer. This opinion is
being delivered  to you pursuant to Section 8.2(f) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein but not  otherwise defined in
this opinion shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in  the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

    



    

We have reviewed the Asset Purchase Agreement and such other
company  records of Sellers, certificates of public officials, certificates
of officers  of Sellers and other documents and have made such examinations
of law and fact  as we have deemed necessary or relevant in connection with
the opinions set  forth below. In rendering the following  opinions, we
have assumed, without investigation, the authenticity of any  document or
other instrument submitted to us as an original, the conformity of  the
originals of any document or other instruments submitted to us as a
copy,  the legal capacity of natural persons, and the genuineness of all
signatures on  such originals or copies. We have also  assumed, but have
not independently verified, all documents executed by a party  other than
officers and agents of Sellers, were duly and validly executed
and  delivered by such party and are legal, valid and binding obligations of
such  party enforceable against the party in accordance with their
respective terms.

    



    

With respect to questions of fact, we have relied, without
independent  inquiry or verification by us, solely upon (a) the
representations and  warranties set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement,
(b) written and oral  representations of officers of Sellers, and (c)
certificates of public  officials, and we do not opine in any respect as to
the accuracy of any such  facts. We have conducted no
independent  investigation whatsoever of any factual matter. Certain of the
opinions given herein

    



              
      



    

are  qualified by the phrases "best of our knowledge," "to our knowledge,"
"known to  us" or similar phrases. In each such  case, such knowledge
refers only to the actual existing knowledge of attorneys  in our firm
involved in representing Sellers in the preparation of this opinion  with
only such investigation as is specifically referred to in this
opinion,  without any further investigation or inquiry.   Such terms do
not include any knowledge of other attorneys within our  firm or any
constructive or imputed notice of any matters or items of  information. When
a statement in this  opinion is made "to our knowledge," it means that none
of the attorneys in our  firm involved in representing the Sellers in the
preparation of this opinion  has actual existing knowledge that the
statement is false; it does not mean  that any of such attorneys necessarily
has actual existing knowledge of facts  that would suggest the statement as
true.

    



    

This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Maryland, the  General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the  United
States of America (collectively, "Applicable Law"), except that  Applicable
Law includes only laws and regulations that a lawyer exercising  customary
professional diligence would reasonably recognize as being
directly  applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement. We  express no opinion as to choice of law or conflicts of law
rules or the laws of  any states or jurisdictions other than as specified
above.

    



    

Statements in this opinion as to the legality, validity, binding effect  and
enforceability of the Asset Purchase Agreement are subject to
limitations  imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws  and related court decisions of general applicability
relating to or affecting  creditors rights generally and to the application
of general equitable  principles.

    



    

In addition, without limitation of any of the foregoing, we express
no  opinion herein as to (i) any provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement
that  provides for indemnification to the extent such provision may be
limited by  applicable law, (ii) any consents of third parties that may be
required in  connection with the transfer and assignment of any of the
Assets or the effects  of the failure to have obtained any such consents
that may be required, (iii)  bulk transfer or sales laws, (iv) matters
arising under the Communications Act  of 1934, as amended, or the laws,
rules, regulations or policies of the Federal  Communications Commission, or
(v) antitrust laws.

    



    

Based upon the foregoing, subject to the assumptions, limitations
and  exceptions contained herein, we are of the opinion that:

    



            

1.

      |   



      |   

Each   Maryland Corporate Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing   and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland.

      
---|---|--- 
        



      |   



      |   



      
        

2.

      |   



      |   

The   Maryland LLC Seller is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly   existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Maryland.

      
        



      |   



      |   



      
        

3.

      |   



      |   

The   execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of the Asset
Purchase   Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a

party   and the consummation by Sellers of the transactions contemplated
thereby have   been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other

 **DRAFT**

    



    

, 2002

    



    

Gentlemen:

    



    

We have acted as  special communications counsel for Sinclair Broadcast
Group, Inc., a Maryland  corporation, Sinclair Media II, Inc., a Maryland
corporation, and SCI-Licensee  LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
(collectively, the " _Companies_ "),  and have represented the Companies in
connection with the Asset Purchase  Agreement, dated as of April 18, 2002
  (" _Agreement_ "), among the Companies and Tribune Broadcasting,
Inc.  (" _Buyer_ "), only as Federal Communications Commission (" _FCC_
")  counsel. This opinion is being  delivered pursuant to Section 8.2 (f)
of the Agreement. In delivering this opinion, we are engaged  and acting
solely as special communications counsel for the Companies, and we  are not
engaged or acting as counsel of any type for you or any other person
or  entity. When used herein, "or" shall  mean "and/or" unless the context
otherwise requires. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein  shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement.

    



    

This opinion is  limited strictly to matters arising under the
Communications Act of 1934, as  amended, and the published rules,
regulations, and policies promulgated  thereunder by the FCC (collectively,
" _Communications Laws_ "), and we  express no opinion on any other matter
whatsoever. Furthermore, this opinion is limited to the opinions
expressly  stated herein. No implication shall be  drawn from anything
herein that has the effect of extending any such opinion  beyond what is
expressly stated in such opinion.

    



    

In delivering this  opinion, we have assumed without investigation the
genuineness of all  signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons,
the authenticity of all  documents examined by us, whether or not they are
originals, the conformity of  all copies or facsimile transmissions to the
originals of the same, whether or  not they are certified to be true copies,
the conformity of all unexecuted  documents presented to us as final
versions thereof to the executed originals  of the same, and the accuracy
and completeness of all public records,  including, but not limited to,
those of the FCC.

    



    

The opinions  expressed in this letter are based upon the current law and
facts presently  known to us, and are not guarantees or assurances of any
future fact, event,  occurrence, omission, or condition or that any law,
statute, rule, regulation,  policy, order, case, or interpretation of the
same will not change in the  future. Moreover, this opinion  addresses
matters only as of the date of this opinion and we specifically  disclaim
all responsibility whatsoever for advising you of changes in
matters  addressed herein occurring after such date.

    



              
      



    

We have undertaken  no on-site inspection, independent evaluation of the
technical aspects, or  visual or aural monitoring whatsoever of the
Companies, properties of the  Companies, or television stations WTTV,
Bloomington, Indiana and WTTK, Kokomo,  Indiana (collectively, the "
_Stations_ "), nor have we examined the actual  day-to-day operations of the
Stations, and, accordingly, we express no opinion  with respect to such
matters. Except as  otherwise specifically stated herein, we have undertaken
no independent inquiry  whatsoever of any of the matters addressed in this
opinion. Furthermore, although we have no firsthand  knowledge of the
citizenship, attributable or non-attributable media interests,  or character
or other qualifications under the Communications Laws of the  Companies,
principals of the Companies, or any other person or entity having  any
present or proposed connection with the Companies, we are presently
aware  of no facts that lead us to believe that any of the opinions
expressed below,  as qualified and limited by this letter, are untrue in any
material respect.

    



    

As used in this  letter, the phrases "our knowledge," "known to us," or "we
are presently aware"  or similar phrases mean the current actual knowledge,
that is, the conscious  awareness of facts or other information, of lawyers
currently affiliated with  this firm who have given substantive legal
attention to representation of the  Companies in connection with the
transactions contemplated under the Agreement,  including but not limited to
the preparation of this letter.

    



    

We express no  opinion whatsoever in this letter as to your qualifications
under the  Communications Laws, or such qualifications of your assigns, if
any, to have an  ownership interest in or to control, directly or
indirectly, any license or  other authorization issued by the FCC or any
person or entity holding such  license or authorization.

    



    

In connection with  the issuance of this letter, we have examined only the
publicly available  records of the principal office of the FCC located in
Washington, D.C. as  of 2002,  together with such provisions of the
Communications Laws as we have deemed  necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. With respect to questions of fact relevant  to the opinions
expressed herein, we have assumed and relied, without  independent inquiry
or verification by us, upon the accuracy and completeness  of: (a) all
statements, certifications,  representations and warranties set forth in the
Agreement and in the  applications on FCC Form 314 filed with the FCC on ,
2002, requesting FCC consent to the  assignment of the Stations to Buyer;
and (b) the information located in the  publicly available electronic
databases and the publicly available files in the  public reference room of
the FCC in Washington, D.C. at the times inspected  that relate to the
Stations (such FCC information, the " _FCC Review Materials_ "). We have not
examined or investigated the  records which may be available in any other
office within the FCC. You should be aware that certain records of  the FCC
are public as a matter of law (for example, under the federal Freedom  of
Information Act). Such records,  however, may not have been included in the
FCC Review Materials at the time  that we examined those materials in
connection with this opinion. Accordingly, we express no opinion
regarding  the completeness of the FCC Review Materials at the time we
reviewed them. Furthermore, there may be records of matters  pending at the
FCC that were not available for inspection by the public as a  matter of law
that we did not examine.

Based upon the  foregoing, and subject in all respects to the qualifications
and limitations  set forth in this letter, we are of the opinion that:

    



    

1. The Companies have been authorized by the FCC to hold the FCC  licenses, permits and authorizations as listed in _Exhibit A_ hereto (the  " _FCC Licenses_ "). All of such FCC  Licenses are in full force and effect.   The FCC Licenses include all FCC licenses, permits and authorizations  necessary to operate the Stations on the frequencies and in the communities of  license listed in _Exhibit A_.

    



    

2. The FCC has granted its consent to  the assignment of the Stations to Buyer (the " _FCC Consent_ "). The time within which any party in interest  other than the FCC may seek administrative or judicial reconsideration or  review of such consent has expired and, to our knowledge, no petition for such  reconsideration or review was timely filed with the FCC or with a court of  competent jurisdiction. The normal time  within which the FCC may review such consent on its own motion has expired and,  to our knowledge, the FCC has not undertaken such review.

    



    

3. Except for rulemaking proceedings  or similar proceedings of general applicability to entities such as the  Companies or to facilities such as the Stations, to our knowledge, there is not  now pending any action or proceeding by or before the FCC with respect to the  Stations that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect  upon the Stations.

    



    

This opinion is  (i) solely for your information in connection with the
transactions  contemplated under the Agreement, (ii) not to be relied upon
by any other  person or entity for any reason (iii) not to be quoted in
whole or in part or  otherwise referred to in any document except as
directly a part of and related  to such transactions, and (iv), except as
otherwise required by applicable law,  not to be filed with or provided to
any government agency or any other entity  or person whatsoever.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

    



    

Reference is made to the Agreement relating to the sale by Sellers of  the
assets of broadcast television stations WTTV-TV (Indianapolis, IN)
and  WTTK-TV (Kokomo, IN) to Buyer, as contemplated by the Agreement. I am
counsel to and Assistant Secretary of  Buyer and as such I am familiar with
the transactions contemplated by the  Agreement. Capitalized terms
not  defined herein have the meanings specified in the Agreement.

    



    

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 8.3(f) of the Agreement, this  will
advise you that in the opinion of the undersigned:

    



    

1. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

    



    

2. The execution, delivery and performance  by Buyer of the Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a  party and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated thereby  have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other required action  on the part of Buyer.

    



    

3. The Agreement and each of the Ancillary  Documents to which Buyer is a party have been duly executed and delivered by  Buyer, and the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation,  enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

    



    

For the purpose of rendering the foregoing opinions, I have relied, as  to
various questions of fact material to such opinions, upon
the  representations made in the Agreement and upon certificates of officers
of  Buyer. I have examined originals, or  copies of originals certified to
my satisfaction, of such agreements,  documents, certificates and other
statements of government officials and other  instruments material to such
opinions.   I have also examined such questions

    



              
      



    

of law and have satisfied myself as to such matters of fact, in each  case,
as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for this opinion. I have
assumed the authenticity of all  documents submitted to me as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures, the  legal capacity of all natural persons
and the conformity with the original  documents of any copies thereof
submitted to me for my examination.

    



    

The opinions rendered above are limited to the General Corporation Law  of
the State of Delaware, the federal laws of the United States of America
and  the laws of the State of Illinois.

    



    

This opinion letter is being delivered solely for the benefit of
the  persons to whom it is addressed, accordingly, it may not be quoted,
filed with  any governmental authority or other regulatory agency or
otherwise circulated  or utilized for any other purpose without my prior
written consent.

    



    

Very truly yours,
