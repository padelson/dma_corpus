ARTICLE IV 
  _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_  

   

 4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of Merger Sub, the following will occur: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiaries of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no payment will be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 4.2_, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section 4.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into the right to receive $1.80 in cash per share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 4.1(c)_ upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 4.2_, without interest (or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights contemplated by _Section 4.6_). 

   

 (d) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such adjustment will be made for issuances of shares of Company Common Stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock) that occur in the ordinary course of the Companys business pursuant to the conversion, exchange or exercise of any outstanding securities which are in existence as of the date of this Agreement or permitted by the terms hereof to be issued after the date hereof. 

   

 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent appointed by Parent and reasonably approved by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this  _Section 4.2_, cash in an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of any shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending distribution of the 

    ##### 

  

    

cash deposited with the Exchange Agent, such cash will be held in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration and will not be used for any other purposes; _provided_
, _however_ , any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable under _Section 4.1(c)_ will be promptly returned to
Parent. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent provided that (i) such investments will be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, and (ii) no such investments will
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this _Article IV_. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and as reasonably approved by the Company and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss required by _Section 4.2(g)_) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_, subject to any required withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section 4.2(f)_, and the surrendered Certificate will immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such Certificates. In the event a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it will be a condition of payment of the Merger Consideration that (A) the surrendered Certificate be properly endorsed, with signatures guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (B) the Person requesting payment (I) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate, or (II) establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 4.2_, each Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss required by _Section 4.2(g)_ ) will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 4.2_. The term " _Person_ " means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Surviving Corporation other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_ and _Section 4.2(g)_ (or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights contemplated by _Section 4.6_) and any dividend or distribution with respect to shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates with a record date prior to the Closing Date. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article IV_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this _Section 4.2_ will be entitled to receive, upon demand, only from Parent payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) will be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. 

   

 4.3 _Company Options_. Each Company Stock Option (as defined in _Section 5.2(a)_ ), to the extent outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall thereafter no longer be exercisable except that the holder thereof (the " _Option Holder_ ") shall be entitled to a payment in cash (the " _Option Payment_ "), as of the Effective Time, in an amount (if any) equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option held by such Option Holder, whether or not then vested or exercisable, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,  _minus_ (ii) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld by the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Company, for the benefit of the Option Holders, cash in an amount equal the aggregate amount of all Option Payments. Each Option Payment shall be paid by the Company or its agent to the applicable Option Holder as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. The Company Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) agrees to adopt resolutions to amend the Company Stock Plans to approve and effectuate the foregoing. 

  

 4.4 _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. The Company shall take all actions with respect to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _1998 ESPP_ ") and the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Foreign Employees (the " _Foreign Employees ESPP_ ", and together with the 1998 ESPP, the " _Company ESP Plans_ ") as are necessary to assure that (i) the Company ESP Plans shall continue to be suspended, (ii) there shall not be any additional Offering Period (as defined in the 1998 ESPP) or additional Purchase Period (as defined in the Foreign Employees ESPP), as the case may be, commencing following the date of this Agreement, and (iii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company ESP Plans are terminated. 

  

 4.5 _Actions by the Company_. Except as contemplated by _Section 4.3_, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation is not bound by any options, warrants, rights, awards, convertible debt securities, other convertible securities 

   ##### 

  

    

or similar arrangements to which the Company is a party which would entitle
any Person (other than Parent) to beneficially own shares of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or receive any payments (other than as set forth in
_Section 4.3_) in respect of such options, warrants, rights, awards,
convertible debt securities, other convertible securities or similar
arrangements. 

  

 4.6 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands (and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such demand) appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holder of Dissenting Shares will only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law, including the right to receive payment of the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.6(a)_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon compliance with the exchange procedures (including the surrender of the Certificate representing such shares) set forth in _Section 4.2_. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in any negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, negotiate with any holder of Company Common Stock the terms of any payment, or make any payment, with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands, and the Company shall not communicate with any holder of Company Common Stock with respect to such demands, without prior consultation with Parent, except for communications directed to the Companys stockholders generally or as required by Law.

   ##### 

   

 

each such case regarding or to facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal,
(iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar
agreement or commitment with respect to any Takeover Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or agree to, approve, endorse or
resolve to recommend or approve any Takeover Proposal, except in each case as
otherwise specifically provided in _Section 7.2(b)_ , (iv) grant any waiver
or release under any standstill or similar agreement by any Third Party who
has made a Takeover Proposal, (v) take any action to exempt any Third Party
from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of
Delaware Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or (vi)
authorize or direct any Company Representative to take any such action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 7.2(a)_ or
any other provision of this Agreement prohibits the Company or the Company
Board from (A) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
required by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) making such disclosure to the
Companys stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after receiving advice from its outside counsel, is required under applicable
Law in order to comply with its fiduciary duties, or (C) notifying any Third
Party solely of the existence of, and restrictions under, the provisions of
this _Section 7.2_, _provided_ that the Company may not, except as permitted
by _Section 7.2(b)_, withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify,
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and it shall cause the Company Representatives and its
Subsidiaries to, immediately terminate any existing activities, discussions,
solicitations or negotiations with any Third Party conducted previously with
respect to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
restrictions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or this _Section 7.2(a)_, nothing
in this Agreement prevents the Company or the Company Board from furnishing
(or causing to be furnished), prior to, but not after, the time the vote is
taken with respect to adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
at the Company Meeting, information concerning its business, properties or
assets, which information is not of greater scope, area or detail than was
provided to Parent, to any Third Party pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and may negotiate and participate in discussions
and negotiations with such Third Party who has made a bona fide, written
Takeover Proposal, but only if: (w) such Takeover Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement (it being understood that such a Takeover Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement by a Third Party who has made a
Takeover Proposal prior to the date of this Agreement is considered a
new Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement); (x) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives has solicited,
initiated, or knowingly facilitated or encouraged any Takeover Proposal, or
otherwise directly or indirectly violated this _Section 7.2_ (other than
unintentional breaches that (1) have not directly or indirectly resulted in
the making of such Takeover Proposal and (2) otherwise have had only an
immaterial impact on Parents rights under this _Section 7.2_); (y) such
Third Party has submitted a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has
determined (after consulting with outside legal counsel) either (i)
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) is more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger
and is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from its
outside counsel, that such action is required to discharge the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.
The Company shall not release or permit the release of any Third Party from,
or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company is a
party or under which the Company has any rights. The Company shall promptly
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent telephonically
and in writing of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry received by the Company that is or could reasonably be expected to
constitute or lead to a Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall promptly
communicate in writing to Parent the terms and conditions of any such
proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which 

     ##### 

 

  

it may receive, and provide a copy of any written proposal and the identity of
the Third Party making the same. The Company shall inform Parent within
twenty-four (24) hours after any change to the material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal. Within twenty-four (24) hours after any determination by
the Company Board that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a written notice advising
them of such determination, specifying the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party making such Superior
Proposal, and providing Parent and Merger Sub with a copy of the Superior
Proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by and in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to, but not after, the time the vote is taken with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger at the Company Meeting, the Company Board may make a change in the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (including, for such purpose, a withdrawal of such Company Board Recommendation) (a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ ") and/or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (and, in connection therewith, take such action as shall be necessary to exempt such Superior Proposal from any Takeover Statute and the Company Rights Agreement), and the Company may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in connection with the termination of this Agreement, in each case if (A) the Company has received a Superior Proposal which is pending at the time the Company determines to take such action, (B) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after receiving advice from its outside counsel, that such action is required to discharge the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (C) at least three (3) Business Days have passed following Parents receipt of an Adverse Recommendation Notice (as defined below), and Parent does not make an offer within such three (3) Business Day period that is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as the Superior Proposal, as concluded by the Company Board in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and receiving advice from its outside counsel (it being agreed that the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following receipt of such offer and that the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation until the earlier of the receipt of Parents revised offer or three (3) Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Adverse Recommendation Notice). 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) The term " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ " means a written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept or recommend or advising Parent that it intends to make a Change in Company Recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the other information required by  _Section 7.2(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , any material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period. 

   

 (ii) The term " _Competing Transaction_ " means any transaction, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of (A) assets that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) fifteen percent (15%) or more (in number or voting power) of any class of equity securities or other capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, 

   ##### 

  

   

in any such case pursuant to any transaction or series of
transactions, including (I) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other
business combination (including any so-called merger-of-equals and whether or
not the Company is the entity surviving any such transaction) involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (II) a sale, issuance, exchange, transfer
or other disposition of shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (III) a sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (IV) a
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with respect to either
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, which is structured to permit
such Third Party or another Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of
assets that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or fifteen percent (15%) or more of the equity interest in either the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (iii) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited written proposal or offer (whether a Takeover Proposal or otherwise) by a Third Party to acquire (whether by way of merger, acquisition or otherwise), directly or indirectly, greater than fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or the effect of which would be that the stockholders of the Company beneficially own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the combined or ongoing entity), or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and (A) otherwise on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors), and taking into account all relevant terms and conditions of the proposal or offer that it deems relevant (including all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects, including any financing condition and time to consummation), to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, and (B) which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably likely to be consummated. 

   

 (iv) The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest (including any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest to its stockholders), whether in writing or otherwise, from a Third Party that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction. 

   

 (v) The term " _Third Party_ " means any Person or group other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent. 

  

 7.3 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company, in cooperation with Parent, shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing the Proxy Statement or any other filing with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance of its filing with the SEC or other applicable Governmental Entity and the Company shall consider and act in good faith with respect to the incorporation of any changes in such filings reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy 

   ##### 

  

 

Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other
regulatory authorities under this  _Section 7.3_ to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of Law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event occurs, or any information relating to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
any other filing with any Governmental Entity, so that the Proxy Statement or
such other filing shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Proxy
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties, and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company,
such amendment or supplement. 

   

 7.4 _Company Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its certificate of incorporation and by-laws and SEC rules to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on such matters. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, the obligation of the Company to convene and hold the Company Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by a Change in Company Recommendation or by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_ , (i) the Company Board shall recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Unless such recommendation shall have been withdrawn or modified in accordance with _Section 7.2_ (but without affecting in any manner the Companys obligations pursuant to _Section 7.3_), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by Delaware Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn the Company Meeting, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting. 

  

 7.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.5(b)_ , the Company and Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take or omit to take, or cause to be taken or omitted, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other Third Party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, in connection with the 

    ##### 

  

 

authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) as promptly as practicable,
and on a mutually agreed date, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act and any other applicable
federal or state securities Laws, (B) any Antitrust Law (as defined below)
and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable
Law, and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out
the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall consult and
cooperate with each other, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with the obtaining of all such consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders, including (i)
keeping the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) providing copies of
written notices or other communications received by such party or any of its
respective Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information and
with the right to withhold confidential information, providing copies of any
proposed filings to be made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto) and (iv) if requested,
accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. The Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law (including all information required to be included in the
Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, each party shall (i)
promptly notify the other party in writing of any communication received by
that party or its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity, and subject to
applicable Laws, provide the other party with a copy of any such
written communication (or an oral or written summary of any oral
communication), and (ii) not participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless, where practicable, it consults with the other party in
advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and where
practicable, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this _Section 7.5(a)_ modifies or affects their
respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 7.5(b)_. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign Law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade, as the case may be (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to respond to requests of any Governmental Entity for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates are required to (i) proffer to, or agree to, sell, license, lease, transfer or otherwise encumber (or consent to any sale, license, lease, transfer or other encumbrance or agreement to sell, license, lease, transfer or otherwise encumber by the Company), before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) proffer to, or agree to, hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (iii) agree to any other changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment 

   ##### 

  

 

of, Parents ability to own or operate the operations of any such assets or
businesses or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends with
respect to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock
of the Surviving Corporation, or (iv) take any other action under this
_Section 7.5_ if any applicable Governmental Entity seeks a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger. The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of the
waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. 

   

 (c) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time or such earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause the conditions in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_, as the case may be, not to be satisfied, (ii) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Merger, or (iv) any offers received by the Company and its Subsidiaries to settle or compromise any litigation, claim, grievance, charge or proceeding involving Intellectual Property or any other material litigation, claim, grievance, charge or proceeding. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 7.5_ does not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

   

 7.6 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, including information relating to Contracts with Governmental Entities, insurance, pending litigation or claims, employee and employment matters, and information regarding Company membership in standards organizations; _provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ affects or modifies any representation or warranty made by the Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing do not require the Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any Person or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such Person to such inspection or disclosure or (b) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ must be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by such executive officer. All information that is made available pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ is governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 7.7 _Notice of Certain Matters_. Without limiting the Companys obligations under  _Section 7.5(c)_, each party shall notify the other in writing promptly after learning of any of the following: (i) any notice or other communication from any Third Party alleging that the consent of such Third Party is or may be required in connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; (iii) any action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against it or any of its Subsidiaries, or known by it or any of its Subsidiaries to be threatened against it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders in their capacity as such, or of any oral or written correspondence from any Third Party asserting or implying a

written inquiry by any Taxing authority, regarding a material deficiency to
pay Taxes payable by the Company; or (vi) any event that occurs after the
date of this Agreement that, had it occurred prior to the date of this

forth in _Section 5.6(e)_. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give to the other party prompt notice of any representation or
warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement known to have become
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any known failure by such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties

the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company. 

   

 7.8 _Removal of Company Common Stock From Pink Sheets_. If immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets, the Company shall give timely notice of removal of the Company Common Stock from quotation on the Pink Sheets to the Market Integrity Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Company Common Stock to cease to be quoted on the Pink Sheets effective as of the Effective Time and, if applicable, to report timely such event on Form 8-K. 

  

 7.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger will be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with and use reasonable efforts to agree on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law.

 7.10 _Company and Parent Benefit Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall take, in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, all actions necessary to terminate any or all Company Benefit Plans (other than employment agreements, consulting agreements and the Company Benefit Plans set forth in Section 7.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the Company Benefit Plans to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. 

  

 7.11 _Loans to Company Employees, Officers and Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all action necessary so that all loans (other than loans under the Companys 401(k) plan, travel advances, payroll advances and other advances made in the ordinary course of business, which in each case do not exceed $1,000) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of their employees, officers or directors will no longer be outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and any successor entity to the Surviving Corporation) to indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, who has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), arising out of or incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, demand or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law for officers and directors of Delaware corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity) within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Third Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Third Party is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity) shall purchase, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity) to purchase, at no expense to the Indemnified Parties, from the Effective Time, a six (6) year tail under the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the premium therefor would not be in excess of the percentage, as set forth in Section 7.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, of the annual premium paid by the Company in its most recent fiscal year, which premium is set forth in Section 7.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such percentage of the annual premium, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the premium for such tail coverage exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, the longest tail coverage as can be obtained for a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (c) If Parent fails to comply with its obligations under this _Section 7.12_, and, in order to enforce an Indemnified Partys rights under this _Section 7.12_, an Indemnified Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent that Parent breached its obligations under this _Section 7.12_, Parent shall pay to the Indemnified Party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit after delivery to Parent of reasonable documentation evidencing such costs and expenses. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.12_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and operate for the benefit of, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives in accordance with _Section 10.8_. 

   

 7.13 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 7.15 _Litigation Insurance Policy_. The Company agrees to cooperate as reasonably requested by Parent with respect to Parents assessment as to whether it is desirable to obtain additional insurance coverage relating to certain litigation matters set forth in Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Litigation Insurance Policy_ "), including providing all reasonably requested information to agents and representatives of Parent. The Company acknowledges and agrees that such cooperation will also include, if requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company using its reasonable best efforts to apply for, and purchase immediately prior to or concurrent with Closing, the Litigation Insurance Policy, such that the purchase will be reflected on the financial statements of the Company prior to Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be the named insureds on the Litigation Insurance Policy and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall be named as additional insureds thereunder. Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for the premium paid with respect to any purchase by the Company of the Litigation Insurance Policy authorized by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.15_ in the event that the Agreement is subsequently terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company agrees to terminate the Litigation Insurance Policy at the request of Parent and return to Parent any premium reimbursement from the insurer. 

  

 7.16 _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company will provide to Parent the Companys apportionment schedule for 2005 and similar available apportionment information for such other years as Parent may reasonably request (the " _Apportionment Information_ "). Any Apportionment Information for the years ending December 31, 2002 and thereafter will be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge, the Apportionment Information is true, correct and complete. Any Apportionment Information for any other year, to the extent available, will be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge, it is true, correct, and, to the extent available, complete. The Apportionment Information for each relevant year will (i) for years ending December 31, 2002 and thereafter indicate all U.S. jurisdictions into which the Company and its Subsidiaries have sales or in which they own property or employ individuals, (ii) for other years, to the extent available, indicate all U.S. jurisdictions into which the Company and its Subsidiaries have sales or in which they own property or employ individuals, (iii) for any year, to the extent available, indicate any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company and its Subsidiaries have sales or in which they own property or employ individuals, and (iv) indicate any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Subsidiary have filed income Tax Returns. The Company will cooperate with Parent as necessary, including by providing access to appropriate personnel to discuss the Apportionment Information and any additional information reasonably requested by Parent, in order to assist Parents review of the Apportionment Information. The Company will also supplement the provision of any Apportionment Information provided to Parent to the extent that, without such supplement, the Chief Financial Officer could not provide the required certificate under  _Section 7.16(b)_. Any provision of supplemental Apportionment Information by the Company to Parent will be via email to the individuals designated for such purpose in _Section 10.6_. Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the Chief Financial Officers certificate with respect to the initial Apportionment Information, and five (5) days of the receipt of any supplemental Apportionment Information, Parent will notify the Company in writing of any income Tax Return that it reasonably believes is delinquent but not disclosed on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each such written notice is referred to as a " _Section_  

    ##### 

  

    

 _7.16(a) Notice_ ") and, if reasonably requested by the Company, Parent will
provide in reasonable detail the legal basis for that belief for each such
Tax Return. If the Company receives a Section 7.16(a) Notice within thirty
(30) days of the Outside Date (as determined without regard to this
sentence), and the failure to file each delinquent Tax Return set forth in
a Section 7.16(a) Notice received within thirty (30) days of the Outside Date
is the sole condition under this Agreement to Closing that has not been
satisfied as of the Outside Date (as determined without regard to this
sentence), the Outside Date will be extended such that the Outside Date
will be thirty (30) days after the date the final Section 7.16(a) Notice is
received by the Company. The parties acknowledge and agree that the filing of
each delinquent Tax Return set forth in a Section 7.16(a) Notice by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, will be sufficient to
satisfy the closing condition set forth in clause (B) of _Section 8.2(m)(i)_.
For purposes of this _Section 7.16_, the Company and Parent agree that a Tax
Return will not be considered to be delinquent if (i) the relevant statute of
limitations (after giving effect to any tolling, waiver, extension, or
mitigation thereof) has expired; (ii) the Company or its Subsidiary has
"substantial authority" within the meaning of Code section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i)
(or a similar standard which avoids the imposition of penalties under
applicable Law) not to file the Tax Return; or (iii) the parties otherwise
agree that the Tax Return need not be filed. 

   

 (b) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, the Company will provide to Parent a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge, (1) the Apportionment Information (as supplemented) provided pursuant to _Section 7.16(a)_ for years ending on December 31, 2002 and thereafter remains true, correct and complete and the Apportionment Information (as supplemented) provided pursuant to Section 7.16(a) for any other year remains true, correct, and, to the extent available, complete and (2) the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(m)_ have been satisfied.

representatives would be subject to the risk of criminal or material civil
sanctions. 

   

 (e) _Required Consents_.

 (b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation or warranty becomes untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in _Sections 8.3(a)_ or  _8.3(b)_ , as the case may be, would not be satisfied and such breach is not cured within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement by the Company will not be available to the Company if the Company is at that time in material breach of this Agreement. 

   

 9.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent: 

  

 (a) if a Company Triggering Event (as defined below) has occurred; or

   #####

 (D) the Company Board, upon request of Parent following receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction, fails to reaffirm to Parent the approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after such request; or

 9.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article IX_, this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section 10.1_) becomes void and of no effect with no liability or obligation on the part of any party (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no termination relieves any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any fraud or willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement affects the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations survive in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $5,250,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the date that the Termination Fee is due as provided below, in the event this Agreement is terminated: 

    

 (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _(b)_ , if the following occurs: 

   

 (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Meeting, any Third Party makes a Takeover Proposal (substituting 35% for the 15% threshold in the definition of Competing Transaction for purposes of this _Section 9.5(b)(i)_) to the Company or publicly discloses or announces an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, prior to either (1) with respect to any termination pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, the date of such termination or (2) with respect to any termination pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ , the date of the Company Meeting; and 

   

 (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate, or consummates, or approves or recommends to the Companys stockholders or otherwise does not oppose, a Competing Transaction with such Third Party; 

   

 (ii) by the Company (A) pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ and, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, a Company Triggering Event shall have occurred or (B) pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_; or 

   

 (iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_. 

 

The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee no later than: (x) two (2)
Business Days after the first to occur of the execution of an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality   ##### 

  

  

  

agreement), approval or recommendation to the Companys stockholders of a
Competing Transaction, failure to oppose a Competing Transaction or the
consummation of a Competing Transaction, in the case of clause (i) above; (y)
on the date of termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (ii)
above; and (z) two (2) Business Days after termination of this Agreement in
the case of clause (iii) above. Parent and Merger Sub agree that payment of
the Termination Fee, if such fee is actually paid, will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon termination of this Agreement.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.5(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the
Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee, from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as announced in _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made,
after delivery to the Company of reasonable documentation evidencing such
costs and expenses.

 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any annexes, exhibits and schedules to this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement, dated October 26, 2006, by and between the Company and Parent, as amended (as may be further amended in writing, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 7.12_ ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_), this Agreement is not intended and is not to be deemed or construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties who are signatories to this Agreement any rights or remedies hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other party in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. The parties further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under  _Section 7.12_ do not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 10.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in the list of defined terms included in this Agreement is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

  

 10.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision does not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of it, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 10.12 _Interpretation; Construction_. 

  

 (a) The table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference is to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the word "shall" or similar word is used in this Agreement, it means "has a duty to" and the words "shall not" or similar words mean "has a duty not to." For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge" of the Company shall mean the actual knowledge, after reasonable due inquiry, of those persons set forth on Section 10.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 10.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement is not assignable by operation of Law or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub will be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement will be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

  

 10.14 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 9.5_, all fees, charges and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the fees and expenses of its advisors, brokers, finders, agents, accountants and legal counsel) (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.
