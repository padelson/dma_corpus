of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss required by <U>Section&nbsp;4.2(g)</U>) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder
of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;IV</U>, subject
to any required withholding Taxes pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.2(f)</U>, and the surrendered
Certificate will immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates. In the event a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it will be a condition of payment

signatures guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (B)&nbsp;the Person requesting
payment (I)&nbsp;pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate, or (II)&nbsp;establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U>, each Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss required by <U>Section
4.2(g)</U>) will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U>.

joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.

Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Surviving Corporation other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;4.2(b)</U> and <U>Section
4.2(g)</U> (or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights contemplated by <U>Section&nbsp;4.6</U>)
and any dividend or distribution with respect to shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such
Certificates with a record date prior to the Closing Date. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this <U>Article&nbsp;IV</U>.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and any successor entity to
the Surviving Corporation) to indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, who has been
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the &#147;<U>Indemnified Parties</U>&#148;), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements (collectively, &#147;<U>Costs</U>&#148;), arising out of or incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, demand or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware Law for officers and directors of Delaware corporations. Each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity)
within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that any Third Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Third Party is not entitled to indemnification.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity) shall
purchase, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or successor entity) to purchase, at no
expense to the Indemnified Parties, from the Effective Time, a six (6)&nbsp;year tail under the current
policies of the directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the premium therefor would not be in excess of the
percentage, as set forth in Section&nbsp;7.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, of the annual
premium paid by the Company in its most recent fiscal year, which premium is set forth in Section
7.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such percentage of the annual premium, the &#147;<U>Maximum
Premium</U>&#148;). If the premium for such tail coverage exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, the longest
tail coverage as can be obtained for a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent that Parent breached its
obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.12</U>, Parent shall pay to the Indemnified Party its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit after delivery to Parent of reasonable documentation evidencing such
costs and expenses.

Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board

Company&#146;s apportionment schedule for 2005 and similar available apportionment information for such

Apportionment Information for the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 and thereafter will be certified
by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge, the
Apportionment Information is true, correct and complete. Any Apportionment Information for any
other year, to the extent available, will be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge, it is true, correct, and, to the extent
available, complete. The Apportionment Information for each relevant year will (i)&nbsp;for years
ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 and thereafter indicate all U.S. jurisdictions into which the Company and
its Subsidiaries have sales or in which they own property or employ individuals, (ii)&nbsp;for other
years, to the extent available, indicate all U.S. jurisdictions into which the Company and its
Subsidiaries have sales or in which they own property or employ individuals, (iii)&nbsp;for any year, to

with Parent as necessary, including by providing access to appropriate personnel to discuss the
Apportionment Information and any additional information reasonably requested by Parent, in order
to assist Parent&#146;s review of the Apportionment Information. The Company will also supplement the
provision of any Apportionment Information provided to Parent to the extent that, without such
supplement, the Chief Financial Officer could not provide the required certificate under
<U>Section&nbsp;7.16(b)</U>. Any provision of supplemental Apportionment Information by the Company to
Parent will be via email to the individuals designated for such purpose in <U>Section&nbsp;10.6</U>.
Within twenty (20)&nbsp;days of receipt of the Chief Financial Officer&#146;s certificate with respect to the
initial Apportionment Information, and five (5)&nbsp;days of the receipt of any supplemental
Apportionment Information, Parent will notify the Company in writing of any income Tax Return that
