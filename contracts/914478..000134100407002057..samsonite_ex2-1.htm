among Cameron 1 S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg corporation (" _Parent_ "), Cameron
Acquisitions Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Samsonite Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "); and

  

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as an inducement to
Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations
set forth herein, certain of the Companys stockholders, who beneficially or
of record hold an aggregate of approximately 85% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Principal Stockholder_ "), have entered into
a Written Consent and Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with
Parent (the " _Written Consent and Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which,
upon the terms set forth therein, such stockholders have agreed to take
specified actions in furtherance of the Merger, including executing and
delivering written consents (each, a " _Principal Stockholder Consent_ ")
under Section 288 of the DGCL pursuant to which this Agreement and the Merger
are adopted in accordance with Section 251(c) of the DGCL immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I

  



  

THE MERGER

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ")
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the Company
in accordance with the DGCL.

  

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time in Delaware, on a date to be
specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be no later than
sixth business days after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those that, by their terms, are to be satisfied by action at the Closing, but
subject to such satisfaction or

  



  



  
   



  

 waiver) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom (UK) LLP,
40 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, England, E14 5DS.

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the parties shall
execute and file in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, a form of which is
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger
shall become effective at the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger, or
at such later time as is agreed upon by the parties hereto and set forth
therein (such time as the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

  

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Company. Subject to _Section 5.12_ , at the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended to read
in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub read
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Company shall be "Samsonite Corporation", and (b) the by-laws of the Surviving
Company shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the by-laws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law, except that the
references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to "Samsonite
Corporation".

  

SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERGER
SUB IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME SHALL BE THE INITIAL BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY, AND THE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME SHALL BE THE INITIAL OFFICERS OF THE
SURVIVING COMPANY.

  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 **CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.1(f)_
and _Section 2.1(g)_ , each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), of the Company (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting
Shares (to the extent provided in _Section 2.1(g)_ ) shall thereupon be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to $1.49, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

        



  |  

(b)

  |  

_Company Stock Options_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(i) Each unexercised option to purchase or acquire shares of Company Common
Stock under the Option Plans (each such option, a " _Company_ 

  



  

2

  
   



  

  _Stock Option_ "), including unvested Company Stock Options, shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, and, (A) in the case of a
Company Stock Option having a per share exercise price less than the Merger
Consideration, such option shall be converted into the right to receive from
the Surviving Company an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in
cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (B) in the case of a Company
Stock Option having a per share exercise price (the " _Options Consideration_
") equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such option shall be
canceled without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in
respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Stock Option as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights
the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock
Option. The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary to accelerate
the vesting of all Company Stock Options that are not vested Company Stock
Options as of the Effective Time.

  

(ii) All payments with respect to canceled Company Stock Options
shall be made by the Paying Agent (and Parent and the Surviving Company shall
cause Paying Agent to make such payments) as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time from the Exchange Fund. Such payments shall be accompanied by a
letter from the Paying Agent explaining how the payment amounts with respect
to the canceled Company Stock Options were determined.

  

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions
as may be necessary (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause
any transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.1(b)_ by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

  

(iv) (A) The Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and
all rights in and the provisions of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of
the Effective Time and (B) the Company shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other commercially reasonable actions such that following the Effective
Time no participant in the Option Plans or other plans, programs or
arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary thereof. No additional
Company Stock Options or other equity based awards shall be granted pursuant

capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that

Agreement to the contrary, other than _Section 2.1(g)(ii)_ , any shares of
Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal
rights for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost or failed to perfect
such appraisal rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
or represent a right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ , but instead shall be converted into the right to receive only such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of

or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Company or of a

holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares
in accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent, then, as of the later
of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares
shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in
_Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

  

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal
rights and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time with respect to
demands for appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal rights of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or

the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and which shall be in a
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of
the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(a);_

6

  
   



  

 or deduct under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_

Company Common Stock which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, Company Stock Options or
Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration, Options Consideration or Warrants Consideration,
respectively.

  

(f) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further

applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate,
Book Entry Share, Company Stock Option or Warrant shall not have been
surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration, Options
Consideration or Warrants Consideration in respect of such Certificate, Book
Entry Share, Company Stock Option or Warrant would otherwise escheat to or

obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government and repurchase
agreements in respect of such obligations. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall be the property of, and shall be paid to,
Parent. Any losses resulting from such investment shall not in any way
diminish Parents and Merger Subs payment obligation under _Section 2.1(a),
(b) and (c)_.

  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by

  



  

8

that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration.

likely to adversely affect the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any
fraud of which the Company has knowledge, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act); to the Companys knowledge, such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be included in the Companys
periodic reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys
knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to such material information required to be included in the Companys
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

the Company, has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not

(or in the notes thereto).

of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ ") applicable to the

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their

Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,

Section 3.7

  |  

Employee Benefit Plans. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Section 3.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists all
material Company Benefit Plans as of the date hereof (other than those
employment agreements and offer letters providing for an annual base salary of
less than $250,000). " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means all employee benefit
plans, compensation arrangements and other benefit arrangements, whether or
not "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ ")), providing
cash- or equity-based incentives, health, medical, dental, disability,
accident or life insurance benefits or vacation, severance, retirement,
pension or savings benefits, that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by the Company, any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of employees, directors, consultants, officers, former
employees, former consultants, former officers and former directors of the
Company or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries and all employee agreements providing
compensation, vacation, severance or other benefits to any officer, employee,
consultant or former employee of the Company or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries,
except to the extent providing mandatory benefits required by applicable
foreign Law.

  

(b) Any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it is so qualified and exempt from
income tax under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, and no event has
occurred which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss, revocation or
denial of such qualified status or any favorable determination letter. Each
Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in compliance with
its terms and applicable Law (including ERISA and the Code to the extent
applicable thereto), except for such non-compliance which has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. All employer and employee contributions to each
Company Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of such Company Benefit
Plan have

  



  

14

  
   



  

 been made, except for such contributions the failure of which to make has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending, threatened or
anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plan, by any
employee or beneficiary covered under any Company Benefit Plan, or otherwise
involving any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits)
except for any such claims which have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or
penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA which would
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or has engaged in any transaction which is reasonably likely
to result in any liability or penalty which would be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, there have been no non-exempt prohibited transactions
(as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Code Section 4975) with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, no fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any such plan, and no material
action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation with respect to the
administration or the investment of the assets of such plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) is pending or threatened in writing.

  

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer
plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or a "multiple
employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413 of the Code. No
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums
due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid
when due).

  

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in combination with another event (A) entitle any current or former
employee, consultant, director or officer of the Company or any its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
compensatory benefit or payment, except as required by applicable Law, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, consultant, director or officer, (C)
result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination
with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment," as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, or (D) result in the
triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the rights of
the Company to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan. No person is
entitled to be compensated (whether by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Company or any other person) for excise or other additional
Taxes paid pursuant to Code Section 409A or any similar provision of any state
or local Law of the United States. No person that is a "named executive
officer" (as defined in the Company SEC Documents) is entitled to be
compensated (whether by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Company or any other person) for excise or other additional Taxes paid
pursuant to Code Section 4999 or any similar provision of any state or local
Law in the United States.

  



  

15

  
   



  

 (e) Except as required by applicable Law, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any material obligation to provide medical, health,
life insurance or other welfare benefits for currently retired or future
retired or terminated employees, their spouses or their dependents (other than
in accordance with Code Section 4980B), including any such obligations
resulting from transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(f) Except as would not individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, (x) no individual who has performed services for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been improperly excluded from
participation in any Company Benefit Plan and (y) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect liability, whether actual or
contingent, with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee, or with respect to any
employee leased from another employer.

  

(g) Each "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in
Section 409(A)(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since January 1, 2005 in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and guidance issued
thereunder, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Benefit Plan that is
not subject to U.S. Law (a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ ") that is required by Law
to be registered has been registered and each Foreign Benefit Plan has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities and has
been operated and maintained in all respects in compliance with Law, except
for such failures to register, operate or maintain as have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any
business or entity which is a member of the same "controlled group of
corporations," under "common control" or an "affiliated service group" with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the meanings of Sections 414(b),
(c) or (m) of the Code, or required to be aggregated with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under Section 414(o) of the Code, or is under "common
control" with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, within the meaning of
Section 400l(a)(14) of ERISA, or any regulations promulgated or proposed under
any of the foregoing Sections of ERISA and the Code.

the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in the
ordinary course, (b) there has not been any event, occurrence, development or
state of circumstances or facts that has had, or would be reasonably expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and (c)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any actions which,
if taken after the date of this Agreement, would be prohibited by Sections
5.1(d) (i), (v) and (ix).

  

Section 3.9 Investigations; Litigation. There (a) is no investigation
or review pending or threatened in writing by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or

  



  

16

  
   



  

 any of its Subsidiaries (including with respect to any directors, officers
or employees for whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable)
which has had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and (b) are no actions, suits,
inquiries, investigations or proceedings pending or threatened in writing
against or affecting the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets or properties at law or in equity before, and there are no

case, which has had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to be included in
the Information Statement will, in the case of the Information Statement or
any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of

delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Written Consent
and Voting Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions

cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its

would not reasonably be expected to, significantly impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

investigations or proceedings pending or threatened in writing against or
affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties at
law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of or
before any Governmental Entity, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to significantly impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

Section 4.5 Information Statement; Other Information. None of the
information with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the
Information Statement will, in the case of the Information Statement or any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the
Information Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Information Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  



  

24

  
   



  

 Section 4.6 Lack of Ownership of the Company Common Stock. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of the Company Common Stock
or other securities convertible into shares of the Company Common Stock.

  

Section 4.7 Finders or Brokers. Except for Lehman Brothers
International (Europe)  Italian Branch and UBS Limited, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might
be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon
consummation of the Merger.

  

Section 4.8 Availability of Funds. Parents and Merger Subs
obligations hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents,
Merger Subs or any other persons ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have, and as of the Closing will have, (i)
cash on hand, (ii) written equity commitment letters to Parent and Merger Sub,
a form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Equity Commitments_
") and/or (iii) detailed debt commitment letters from Parents financing
sources (the " _Loan Agreements_ ," and together with the Equity Commitments,
the " _Financing Agreements_ "), which together are sufficient to enable
Parent and Merger Sub to perform each of its obligations hereunder, consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and pay
all related fees and expenses, including payment of the Merger Consideration,
payments contemplated by _Section 2.1_ on account of Company Stock Options and
the Warrants and any other repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the
Company. True and correct copies of the Financing Agreements have been
provided to the Company prior to the date hereof. The Financing Agreements
have been duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto and are in full
force and effect enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with
their terms. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the
Financing Agreements. As of the date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub have no
reason to believe that either will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of closing to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub contained
in the Financing Agreements. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Agreements to be paid
on or before the date hereof.

  

Section 4.9 No Disqualification. To the Parents knowledge, there are
no facts that relate to the qualifications of Parent or Merger Sub which
would, under applicable Law, disqualify Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or that would be
reasonably likely to prevent the parties from obtaining any Parent Approval or
Company Approval in a timely manner or which would prevent any Governmental
Entity from consenting to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
timely manner.

  

Section 4.10 Section 203 of the DGCL. None of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective affiliates or associates is or ever has been an "interested
stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) with respect to the
Company.

and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Written Consent and Voting Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, (a)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other person (whether
or not a party to this Agreement and whether or not authorized by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) makes, or has made, any representations or
warranties, express or implied, at law or in equity, relating to itself, the
Company, any Subsidiaries of the Company, or any of their respective
businesses, assets, liabilities or operations, including with respect to
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose or otherwise in

Schedule and any other such representations and warranties are hereby
expressly disclaimed, (b) no person has been authorized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to itself
or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such
representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as
having been authorized by such party and is hereby expressly disclaimed and
(c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information,
memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives are not and
shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any
such materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement and there is no
assurance that any estimates, projections, predictions or any other forward-
looking statements in any such materials or information will be achieved.
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Written Consent and Voting Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company shall merge with Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement on an "as-is,
where-is" basis.

No Solicitation. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of its or their respective Representatives
to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly
facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or

negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information
with respect to, any Company Alternative Proposal or in response to any
inquiries or proposals

  



  

31

  
   



  

 that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Alternative
Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ ), (iii) engage in discussions with any person with respect to
any Company Alternative Proposal, except to notify such person as to the
existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ and except to the extent
specifically permitted under this _Section 5.4_ , (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Company Alternative Proposal, except to the extent specifically
permitted under this _Section 5.4_ or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for, any Company
Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements
specifically permitted under _Section 5.4(c)_ and except to the extent
specifically permitted under this _Section 5.4_ ). The Company shall
immediately terminate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if
any, that are ongoing as of the date hereof with any third party with respect
to a Company Alternative Proposal.

  

(b) Promptly after receipt of any Company Alternative Proposal, the
Company shall notify Parent of its receipt of such Company Alternative

such Company Alternative Proposal, a description of the material terms and
conditions of such Company Alternative Proposal, and copies of any substantive
written communications and documents relating to such Company Alternative
Proposal received by the Company from the third party making such Company
Alternative Proposal.

  

(c) If the Company receives a Company Alternative Proposal which (i)
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, after the taking of any of the actions referred
to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such
Company Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information to the third party, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially the same as the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Company provides copies of the same such
information to Parent, unless such information has previously been provided
to Parent, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
with respect to the Company Alternative Proposal.

  

(d) In response to the receipt of a Company Superior Proposal, the Board
of Directors of the Company may withdraw, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation (a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Board of
Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a Company Superior Proposal, the
failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach by the
directors of their fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law.

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors, after

with its fiduciary obligations, or is otherwise required, under applicable
Law.

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall
mean any inquiry, proposal or offer made by any person prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) the acquisition of the Company by merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, business combination or similar transaction,

person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (iii) the acquisition by any person of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.

obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ ) (i) on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the
Board of Directors reasonably considers to be appropriate (including legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal), would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys

and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall

amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall
reasonably consider all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company

not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or

  



  

33

  
   



  

 submission to it of any Company Alternative Proposal (whether or not it is a
Company Superior Proposal), or by any Company Change of Recommendation
effected pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_. The Company agrees that, except in
accordance with _Section 5.4(d)_ , it shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Company Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Company

Section 5.6

  |  

Employee Matters. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be
honored all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time. With respect to Company Employees who
are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement (or similar agreement or
arrangement in any foreign country) listed on _Section 3.12 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ or any replacement, renewal or extension of any such
agreement (the " _Non-CB Employees_ "), for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Company to provide
such Non-CB Employees with salary, incentive compensation opportunities and
employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Non-CB Employees
immediately before the Effective Time; it being understood that nothing
contained herein shall preclude (i) Parent from changing or terminating any
existing plan, program or arrangement applicable to such Non-CB Employees
pursuant to its terms or (ii) terminating any Non-CB Employees. With respect
to Company Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement (or
similar agreement or arrangement in any foreign country) listed on _Section
3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or any replacement, renewal or
extension of any such agreement (the " _CB Employees_ "), Parent agrees to
honor or cause to be honored all such agreements and provide such CB Employees
with compensation and benefits as set forth in such agreements. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall preclude the Parent from
terminating any CB Employee in accordance with the terms of the applicable
collective bargaining agreement.

  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of
benefits (but not benefit accrual under pension or similar plans) under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time, provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to Company employee benefit plan or compensation
arrangement or agreements in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were waived
under the

  



  

34

  
   



  

 comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

Section 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (a) the occurrence of any event known to it which would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) in the case of the Company,
cause a material breach of any of the Companys representations or warranties
under this Agreement or have a Material Adverse Effect, or, in the case of
Parent, significantly impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (ii) cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to
be unsatisfied in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective
Time; or (b) any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or
threatened in writing which questions or challenges the validity of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the party
giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely by
virtue of having given such notice.

all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non actions, waivers, consents and

as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the

event later than seven (7) days after the date hereof make their respective
filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,

third parties or other

  



  

35

  
   



  

 Governmental Entities (including any foreign jurisdiction in which the
Companys Subsidiaries are operating any business) in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii)
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby,
including taking all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to

authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other
jurisdiction may assert under relevant antitrust or competition laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated thereby.

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.8_ , if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and use reasonable
best efforts to contest, resist and resolve any such action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law
or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such Regulatory
Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For
the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 5.8_ , "reasonable best
efforts" shall include defending through litigation on the merits, including
appeals, any claim asserted in any court or other proceeding by any party, but
shall not include committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
assets or businesses of Parent (including its Subsidiaries) or the Company
(including its Subsidiaries). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory
Law_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, Council Regulation No. 139/2004 of the European Community (the
" _EC Merger Regulation_ ") and all Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition, through merger
or acquisition.

"control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,

Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

advance of the final disposition of any claim related to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing
in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the
case may be (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time. For a period of six (6)

threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is
or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or

  



  

38

  
   



  

 its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy,"
in either case, of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Company be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one
policy year more than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such

if it is ultimately determined such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

(d) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this _Section 5.12_ shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable agreement or Law.

  

(e) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other persons, (ii) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets to
any person or (iii) enters into any similar transaction, then and in each
case, proper provision shall be made so the applicable successors and assigns

shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12,
1999) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the
Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to
equity securities of the Company.

43

  
   



  

  such payment to be made upon consummation of such Qualifying Transaction,
it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
fee referred to in this _Section 7.2_ on more than one occasion; and

_Section 7.1(c)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , then the Company
shall pay to Parent a fee of $50 million in cash and the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or their stockholders or their
Representatives ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall release any party from

(2) business days of such termination by the Company, it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay the fee referred to in this
_Section 7.2_ on more than one occasion;

  

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Qualifying Transaction_ " shall mean any
(i) acquisition of the Company by merger or business combination transaction,
or for a "merger of equals" with the Company; (ii) acquisition by any person

due under this _Section 7.2_ when due and as directed in writing by the other
party to accounts designated by such other party within the time periods
specified in this _Section 7.2_ (the " _Defaulting Party_ ") and the other
party, in order to obtain payment, commences on legal action which results in
a judgment against the Defaulting Party for the amount due under this _Section
7.2_ , then in addition to the amount of such judgment the Defaulting Party
shall pay to the other party an amount equal to its documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in

44

parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  

Section 8.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any

shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

Section 8.12 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This

and Voting Agreement, the Equity Commitments and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except for the
provisions of _Section 5.12_ hereof, this Agreement is not intended to and
shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

  

Section 8.13 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no

to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words

  



  

48

  
   



  

 "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Each of the parties
has participated jointly in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
must be construed as if it is drafted jointly by all the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

Section 8.15 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  



  

49

  
   



  

 

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
