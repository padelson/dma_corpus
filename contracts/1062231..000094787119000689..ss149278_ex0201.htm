detailed supporting information (the " _Initial Closing Statement_ "),
setting forth the Purchaser's determination of (i) the Closing Indebtedness

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount (and the components thereof) and
either the resulting Closing Date Working Capital Excess or Closing Date
Working Capital Shortfall, as the case may be, (iv) the Closing Transaction
Expenses Amount, (v) the CapEx Shortfall Amount and (vi) the amount of the

Closing Transaction Expenses Amount and the CapEx Shortfall Amount, instead of
the estimated amounts for each such item.

  



  

(b)  Throughout the period following the Seller's receipt of the
Initial Closing Statement until the Objection Deadline Date, the Purchaser
and the Acquired Companies shall permit the Seller and its Representatives
reasonable access (with the right to make copies), during normal business
hours upon reasonable advance notice, to the relevant financial books and
records of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies solely for the purposes
of the review and objection right contemplated herein, together
with reasonable access to the individuals responsible for the preparation of
the Initial Closing Statement in order to respond to the inquiries of the
Seller and its Representatives related thereto in order to verify the
information included in the Initial Closing Statement.

  



  

(c)  The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser by the Objection
Deadline Date either a notice indicating that the Seller accepts the Initial
Closing Statement (the " _Notice of Acceptance_ ") or a detailed statement
describing each of its objections to the Initial Closing Statement (the "
_Notice of Disagreement_ "). If the Seller timely delivers a Notice of
Disagreement, only those matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement
shall be deemed to be in dispute (such matters, the " _Disputed Items_ ") and
all such Disputed Items shall be based only on (i) mathematical or clerical
errors or (ii) that the calculation of the amounts included in the Initial
Closing Statement were not determined in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. The Notice of Disagreement shall specify what the Seller
reasonably believes is the correct amount for each Disputed Item.
Any component of the calculations set forth in the Initial Closing Statement
that is not the subject of a timely delivered Notice of Disagreement by the
Seller shall be final and binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser, unless
the resolution of any Disputed Item affects an undisputed component of the
Initial Closing Statement, in which case such undisputed component shall,
notwithstanding the failure to object to such component in the Notice of
Disagreement, be considered a "Disputed Item" to the extent affected by such
resolved Disputed Item.

  



  

(d)  The Disputed Items shall be resolved as follows:

  



  

(i)  The Seller and the Purchaser shall first use their
reasonable efforts to resolve such Disputed Items (and all such discussions
related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Seller and the
Purchaser, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any
applicable similar state rule)).

  



  

(ii)  Any resolution by the Seller and the Purchaser as to such
Disputed Items shall be in writing and final and binding upon the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of such Disputed Item so resolved, and any
item that is so resolved shall no longer be deemed a Disputed Item.

  



  

   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii)  If the Seller and the Purchaser do not reach a resolution of
all Disputed Items within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), the Seller and the Purchaser
shall, within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period, engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve any remaining
Disputed Items. If one or more Disputed Items are submitted to the Neutral
Accountant for resolution, the Seller and the Purchaser shall enter into a
customary engagement letter, and, to the extent necessary, each Party shall
waive and cause its Affiliates to waive any then-existing conflicts with the
Neutral Accountant and shall cooperate with the Neutral Accountant in
connection with its determination pursuant to this _Section 2.07_. Within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the Neutral Accountant has been
retained, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish, at its own
expense, to the Neutral Accountant and the other Party a written statement of
its positions with respect to each Disputed Item. Within ten (10) Business
Days after the expiration of such fifteen (15)-Business Day period, each
Party may deliver to the Neutral Accountant and to each other its response to
the other's position on each Disputed Item. With each submission, each Party
shall furnish to the Neutral Accountant such information and documents as may
be requested by the Neutral Accountant and may also furnish to the Neutral
Accountant such other information and documents as such Party deems relevant,
in each case with copies being given to the other Party substantially
simultaneously. The Neutral Accountant shall, at its discretion or at the
written request of the Seller and the Purchaser, conduct a conference
concerning the Disputed Items and each of the Seller or the Purchaser shall
have the right to present additional documents, materials and other
information and to have present its Representatives at such conference. No
Party or its Representatives shall be permitted to engage in any ex-parte
communications (whether written or oral) with the Neutral Accountant.

  



  

(iv)  The Neutral Accountant shall be bound by the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and shall be instructed to resolve only the
Disputed Items and shall be instructed not to investigate any other matter
independently. The Neutral Accountant's determination may not be based on its
independent review, but solely on the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the presentations by the Seller and the Purchaser or their respective
Representatives. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Neutral Accountant
may not assign a greater or lesser value to any Disputed Item than that
assigned to such Disputed Item by the Purchaser or the Seller in the Initial
Closing Statement or the Notice of Disagreement, as applicable. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall request that the Neutral Accountant (A) make a final
determination of all the Disputed Items within forty (40) Business Days from
the date the Disputed Items were submitted to the Neutral Accountant and (B)
provide a reasonably detailed basis for its determination in respect of each
Disputed Item. At any time, including, following the Resolution Period, the
Purchaser and the Seller may agree to settle any Disputed Item, including any
Disputed Item submitted to the Neutral Accountant, which agreement shall be in
writing and final and binding on the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of such Disputed Item so resolved; _provided_ , if a
Neutral Accountant has been engaged, the Parties shall promptly provide a
copy of such agreement to the Neutral Accountant and instruct the Neutral
Accountant not to resolve such Disputed Item, it being agreed that if the
Neutral Accountant nonetheless resolves such Disputed Item for any reason,
the agreement of the Parties shall control.

  



  

   

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v)  The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the Disputed
Items, absent Fraud, intentional misconduct or manifest error, shall be final
and binding upon the Parties with respect to the subject matter of the
Disputed Items so resolved. The Parties agree that the procedures set forth
in this _Section 2.07(d)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Initial
Closing Statement and the Closing Date Working Capital Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes.

  



  

(vi)  The Purchaser and the Seller shall each bear their pro rata
share of the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in proportion to the
final allocation made by the Neutral Accountant of the Disputed Items in
relation to the claims made by the Purchaser and the Seller, such that the
prevailing Party pays the lesser portion of such fees and expenses.

  



  

(vii)  The Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert, not as an
arbitrator, in resolving such Disputed Items. The proceeding before the
Neutral Accountant shall be an expert determination under applicable Laws
governing expert determination and appraisal proceedings.

  



  

(e)  The Initial Closing Statement, including any modifications
resulting from the resolution pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)_  of any Disputed
Items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Statement and be final and binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser
for the purposes of this Agreement upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
delivery by the Seller of the Notice of Acceptance or the failure of the
Seller to deliver the Notice of Disagreement by the Objection Deadline Date;
(ii) the resolution of all Disputed Items by the Seller and the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)(i)_ ; and (iii) the resolution of all Disputed
Items pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)(iv)_ by the Neutral Accountant. Within five
(5) Business Days after the Final Closing Statement becomes or is deemed to
be final and binding upon the Parties, an adjustment to the Estimated Closing
Date Payment Amount and a payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in respect thereof shall be made as follows:

  



  

(i)  If the Closing Date Payment Amount, as finally determined
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.07_ , exceeds
the Estimated Closing Date Payment Amount (such difference, the "
_Closing Underpayment_ "), the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount
equal to such Closing Underpayment to the Purchase Price Bank Account.

  



  

(ii)  If the Closing Date Payment Amount, as finally determined
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.07_ , is less
than the Estimated Closing Date Payment Amount (such difference, the "
_Closing Overpayment_ "), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount
equal to such Closing Overpayment to a bank account designated in writing by
the Purchaser (such designation to be made within two (2) Business Days after
the Final Closing Statement becomes or is deemed final).

  



  

(iii)  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing Date Payment
Amount, as finally determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 2.07_ , is equal to the Estimated Closing Date Payment Amount,
no payment shall be made.

  



  

   

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f)  Any payments required to be made by the Seller or the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.07(e)_ shall bear interest from the Closing
Date through the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the three
(3)-month LIBOR (as published by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, a
United Kingdom company, or, if not published therein, in another authoritative
source selected by the Seller and the Purchaser) on the date such payment was
required to be made (or if no quotation for three (3)-month LIBOR is
available for such date, on the next preceding date for which such quotation
is available) plus one hundred fifty (150) basis points.

  



  

(g)  Absent Fraud, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be
indemnified for any Loss to the extent that it is reflected in the Final
Closing Statement. No amount with respect to a matter shall be included more
than once in the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount.

  



  

(h)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies), on the other hand,
may not deduct, set off, hold back or otherwise reduce in any manner
whatsoever any amounts owed to such Party hereunder or pursuant to any
Ancillary Agreement against any amounts owed by such Party hereunder or
pursuant to any Ancillary Agreements to the Seller and/or its Affiliates
or the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, from and
after the Closing, except in the event of Fraud, (i) the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the adjustment of the Purchase Price by the
Specified Items Amount is in full satisfaction of, and is the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Liabilities
arising out of, the Specified Items and the Specified Dispute, (ii) the
Seller shall not be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for the
Specified Items and the Specified Dispute and (iii) the Purchaser
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action that it may have against the Seller
and its Representatives arising under or based upon any applicable Law
(including Environmental Law), including any and all rights, claims or causes
of action for contribution or other relief, reimbursement or compensation
under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act or any analogous state act, with respect to the Specified Items
and the Specified Dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 2.07(i)_ shall limit the rights or remedies of, or constitute a
waiver of any rights or remedies by, any Person pursuant to (or shall
otherwise operate to interfere with the operation of) the other provisions of
this _Section 2.07_ or _Section 11.13_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing herein shall prevent any Purchaser Indemnified Party from seeking
recovery, or recovering, under the RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with
its terms.

  



  

Section 2.08   _Deferred Payment Obligation_. After the Closing, the
Seller shall be entitled to receive, and TopCo shall pay (or cause to be
paid), the payments described in the Deferred Payment Agreement in accordance
with the terms and conditions thereof (the " _Deferred Payment Obligation_
").

  



  

   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.09   _Withholding Rights_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement all
amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision
of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that absent a change in applicable Law following the date hereof and
provided that Purchaser receives the certificate described in _Section
2.05(e)_ , in no event shall Purchaser or its authorized agent be entitled to
deduct and withhold pursuant to any U.S. federal income tax Law in respect of
any amount payable to the Seller under this Agreement. In the event there is
an obligation to deduct and withhold under applicable Law from any amounts
otherwise payable to the Seller pursuant to the Agreement, (a) the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice to the
applicable Seller of the obligation to deduct and withhold no fewer than five
(5) days prior to the date that any such withholding is required, together
with reasonable supporting documentation, and (b) the Purchaser or its
authorized agent shall (i) provide the applicable Seller a reasonable
opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts
from such deduction and withholding under applicable Law, if any, (ii) accept
properly completed and duly executed documentation that is provided at least
one (1) day prior to the applicable payment that will permit any consideration
otherwise payable to the applicable Seller pursuant to this Agreement to be
made without or at a reduced rate of withholding under applicable Law and
(iii) pay the amounts deducted and withheld to the proper Taxing Authority.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

  



  

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser, as of the date
hereof and on the Closing Date, subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in
the corresponding Section of the Disclosure Schedule, which shall be deemed
disclosed in each other Section of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent its
applicability to such other Section is reasonably apparent on its face, as
follows:

  



  

Section 3.01   _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the
Seller_. The Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all necessary
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which it is or will be a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The Seller has all necessary power and authority to own, operate or
lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by the Business
and to carry on the Business as it has been and is currently conducted. The
Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
(to the extent such concepts are recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction which the properties owned or leased by it or the operation of
its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except to the
extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing
(x) would not have a Material Adverse Effect or (y) would not be reasonably
expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of the Seller to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is party. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller
and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller is or will be a party, the
performance by the Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the
Seller.

described in _Section 4.03_ of the Disclosure Schedule, (b) the pre-merger

or delay the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Section 4.04   _Investment Purpose_. The Purchaser is acquiring the
Units solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof other than in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including United States federal
securities laws. The Purchaser agrees that the Units may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state or
foreign securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration under the Securities Act and such Laws.

  



  

Section 4.05   _Financing Commitments; Limited Guarantee_.

  



  

(a)  The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller a true and
complete copy of (i) the executed debt financing commitment letter with the
Debt Financing Sources party thereto (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date hereof) and
any fee letters with the Debt Financing Sources party thereto associated
therewith; _provided_ , that provisions in the fee letter have been redacted
in a customary manner with respect to fees and economic terms and
"market flex" items that do not adversely affect the conditionality of the
applicable Debt Financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that none of such
redacted provisions impose additional conditions on the availability of the
Debt Financing at the Closing (such commitment letter, including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and each such fee letter,
collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ").

  



  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The Purchaser has also delivered to the Seller a true, correct and complete
copy of the executed equity commitment letter (including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date
hereof) from Gamut Investment Fund I, L.P., Gamut Investment Overseas Fund I,
L.P. and Gamut Co-Investors I (A), L.P. (the " _Equity Investors_ ") (the "
_Equity Commitment_ " and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Investors have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest the
cash amount set forth therein for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Equity Financing_ ", and, together with the Debt Financing,
the " _Acquisition Financing_ "). Assuming the Acquisition Financing is
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Financing Commitments and the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_
, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed to the Purchaser pursuant to the
Financing Commitments will be sufficient for the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith incurred or otherwise payable by the Purchaser
(collectively, the " _Required Amounts_ "). The Purchaser has fully paid, or
caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date hereof. The Seller
is an express third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein.

  



  

(b)  As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Purchaser and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letters, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser) the other parties thereto, enforceable against
such parties in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability is
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the Acquisition Financing
that would adversely impact the availability of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date in an amount necessary to consummate the Closing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ at the Closing, the Purchaser has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Acquisition Financing
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Acquisition Financing
will not be available to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. Assuming that the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_  and _Section 8.02_ are satisfied at
the Closing, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that
(with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or
default under the Financing Commitments by the Purchaser. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Purchaser has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the conditions set forth
in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied or (ii) the Acquisition
Financing not being made available to the Purchaser on a timely basis in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of
the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments have been
amended or modified and the respective commitments contained in the Financing
Commitments have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect.

(c)  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Purchaser has delivered to the Seller the duly executed limited guarantee of
Gamut Investment Fund I, L.P., Gamut Investment Overseas Fund I, L.P. and
Gamut Co-Investors I (A), L.P. (collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") attached
as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). The Limited Guarantee is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors and is enforceable
against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
is subject to the Enforceability Exceptions and, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors under the
Limited Guarantee.

  



  

Section 4.06   _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, no Action by or
against the Purchaser is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened, which would reasonably be expected to materially
impair or delay the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Section 4.07   _Brokers_. Except for XMS Capital Partners, LLC, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Purchaser.
The Purchaser is solely responsible for payment of the fees and expenses of
XMS Capital Partners, LLC.

  



  

Section 4.08   _Independent Investigation; Seller 's Representations_.
The Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets
(including Contracts), liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition, technology and prospects of the Business and the Acquired
Companies. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges that
it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and
analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions of the Seller or
its representatives (except the specific representations and warranties of
the Seller set forth in _Article III_ and the Ancillary Agreements). The
Purchaser hereby agrees and acknowledges that, other than the representations
and warranties made in _Article III_ and the Ancillary Agreements, none of the
Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or representatives make or have made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to the
Units, the Acquired Companies or the Business. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, nothing herein shall limit any remedy available
to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in the event of Fraud.

(d)  From and after the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its or their Representatives to, hold in confidence any and all non-public or
otherwise confidential information, whether written or oral, to the extent
concerning the Business and the Acquired Companies that was learned by the
Seller or its Affiliates or their Representatives prior to the Closing,
except to the extent that such information (i) is or has been published or
becomes part of the public domain or otherwise is generally available to the
public through no fault of the Seller, any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by the Seller, any of
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing
from sources other than the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any Acquired
Company which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation. If the Seller, any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives are required to disclose any such information
by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law,
including applicable rules of any securities exchange, the Seller shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, provide prior notice to the Purchaser in
writing, and in so far as is practicable, consult with the
Purchaser regarding the disclosure of such information and shall disclose
only that portion of such information which the Seller is advised by its
counsel is required to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information.

  



  

Section 5.04   _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and
Consents_.

regulation Law.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the Purchaser's
undertaking pursuant to _Section 5.04(a)_ , the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause each of its controlled Affiliates to, take any and all steps necessary
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture,
license or other disposition of such of its, or its controlled Affiliates',
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses
to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the entrance into such other
arrangements, as are necessary in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to assist the Purchaser in good faith with respect to any and all
reasonable steps that the Purchaser, in consultation with its outside
antitrust counsel, deems necessary to comply with its obligations set out in
this _Section 5.04(b)_. In no event shall the Seller, or its Affiliates,
propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any of the foregoing remedies, unless
expressly requested to do so by the Purchaser. In addition, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use its best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligation to litigate in no way limits the obligation
of the Purchaser to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in litigating, including the defense
of a litigation, any challenge to the transactions contemplated hereby that
would prevent the Closing by the Outside Date.

  



  

(c)  Each Party shall keep the other Party apprised of the
content and status of any substantive communications with, and substantive
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly notifying the other
Party of any substantive communication it or any of its Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of
the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any other
applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws and shall permit
the other Party to review in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the other Party in relation to) any proposed substantive
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority relating to such
matters. Neither Party shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry related to the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party in advance and,
unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall provide each other with
copies of all substantive correspondence, filings or substantive
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

(d)  The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its
controlled Affiliates not to, enter into any agreement, transaction, or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that
would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to
materially increase the time required to (i) obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any other applicable
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement
of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,

one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date, the Purchaser and
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents,
approvals and authorizations set forth in _Schedule 5.05(a)_ (collectively,
the " _Third Party Consents_ "); _provided_ , that the Seller shall not be
required to commence or participate in litigation to obtain any such Third

Purchaser with reasonable notice of any of the Seller's discussions with
vendors relating to any Third Party Consents and ensure that the Purchaser

Consents shall not be deemed to be conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b)  From the date hereof until the Closing Date, and during the
one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date, the Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts, and to reasonably cooperate with

5.05(b)(i)(A)_  (other than such Mixed-Use Contracts that are exclusively
related to the Business, which are subject to clause (ii) below), and (B) the
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.05(b)(i)(B)_ (the " _Mexico Mixed-Use
Contracts_ ") into two or more Contracts with the applicable counterparty,
including (x) one or more Contracts to which the Seller and/or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) will be party, with terms and
conditions related to the businesses of the Seller and its Affiliates (other

conditions related to the Business prior to separation (except for changes
reasonably necessary as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby), and
(ii) with respect to any Mixed-Use Contracts set forth on _Schedule
5.05(b)(i)(A)_ that are exclusively related to the Business, the Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to,
use their commercially reasonable efforts, and to reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser, to assign such Mixed-Use Contracts to the Acquired Companies (the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Mixed-Use
Separation_ ").

If the Seller and its Affiliates are not able to separate or assign (as
applicable) a Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use Contract in accordance
with the preceding sentence prior to the Closing, during the one (1)-year
period immediately following the Closing Date, upon the written request of
the Purchaser (with respect to the Mixed-Use Contracts) or the Seller (with
respect to the Mexico Mixed-Use Contracts), the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (and shall reasonably cooperate with each
other) to (i) effect the Mixed-Use Separation with respect to such Mixed-Use
Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use Contract, and (ii) until such Mixed-Use
Separation is effected, (x) provide the Acquired Companies, to the fullest

means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement, if
permissible) and cause the Acquired Companies to bear all obligations, costs
and Liabilities of the portion of the Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use
Contract related to the Business to the extent that the Acquired Companies
receive the rights and benefits of such Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-
Use Contract from and after the Closing and (y) provide the Seller and
its Affiliates, to the fullest extent practicable and permissible under such
Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use Contract, the rights and benefits of

subleasing arrangement, if permissible) and cause the Seller and its
Affiliates to bear all obligations, costs and Liabilities of the portion of
the Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use Contract not related to the
Business to the extent that the Seller and its Affiliates receive the rights

after the Closing. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, and during the
one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date, neither Party
shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or
discussion with, or deliver any written communication to, any non-Affiliated
counterparty to a Mixed-Use Contract or Mexico Mixed-Use Contract with
respect to the Mixed-Use Separation unless it consults with the other Party in

Section 5.06   _Financing; Financing Commitments_.

  



  

(a)   _Financing_.

  



  

(i)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section
5.06_ , the Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its relevant Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Acquisition Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments (and in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, taking
into account any "market flex" provisions) and, prior to the Closing, shall
not permit any termination, amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto, if such amendment, modification
or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Acquisition Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) below the amount necessary to fund the Required Amounts or (B)
impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the Acquisition
Financing or other terms, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

  



  

   

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(y) make, in any material respect, the timely funding of the Acquisition
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Acquisition
Financing less likely to occur such that there would be an adverse impact on
the availability of the Acquisition Financing or (z) materially and adversely
impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Commitments or to draw upon and consummate the
Acquisition Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood
that, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.06(a)(i)_ and
in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities. Any reference in this Agreement to (1)
"Acquisition Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section
5.06(a)(i)_ and (2) "Financing Commitments", "Equity Commitment" or "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as amended or modified
in compliance with this _Section 5.06(a)(i)_.

  



  

(ii)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 5.06_
, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect and satisfy on a timely
basis all terms, covenants and conditions (unless waived pursuant to the
terms thereof) set forth in the Financing Commitments within the
Purchaser's control in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (B) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on
the terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, to the Company than the terms and conditions (including the
"market flex" provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter) that are acceptable
to the Purchaser and would not adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (C) satisfy all
conditions (unless waived pursuant to the terms thereof) to such definitive
agreements on a timely basis that are applicable to the Purchaser that are
within the Purchaser's control and (D) draw upon and consummate the
Acquisition Financing at or prior to the Closing, in any case, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments. Upon written request of
the Seller and subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.06(a)(ii)_ ,
the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days after it becomes aware thereof,
of the receipt by the Purchaser of any written notice or communication (other
than negotiations of the definitive agreements with respect to the Acquisition
Financing) from any Acquisition Financing source with respect to any actual
material and adverse breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Financing Commitments or definitive documents related to the
Acquisition Financing; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or
similar privilege if Purchaser shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

  



  

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 5.06_ ,
if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment
Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner that would have a
materially adverse impact on the Purchaser obtaining the Debt Financing, the
Purchaser shall use its best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions no less
favorable, with respect to conditionality, to the Purchaser than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient, when
added to the portion of the Acquisition Financing that is available to pay in
cash the Required Amounts (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and to obtain
a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Debt
Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), which shall replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letter, a copy of which (together with any related
fee letter; _provided_ that such fee letter has been redacted in a customary
manner with respect to fees and economic terms and "market flex" items that do
not adversely affect the conditionality of such Alternate Debt Financing)
shall be promptly provided to the Seller; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not
be required to accept any Alternate Debt Financing having terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions) less favorable, in any material
respect, to the Purchaser than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that, for purposes of this proviso, less favorable terms and
conditions as to pricing, interest rate or fees shall be considered "in a
material respect"). In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained,
(i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Acquisition Financing" or the
"Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to _clause (ii)_ below and (ii)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitments" or the "Debt
Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters
that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

  



  

(b)  In connection with the Debt Financing, from the date hereof
until the Closing, the Seller shall provide, shall cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser and that is necessary, customary or advisable in connection with
the Purchaser's efforts to obtain the Debt Financing ( _provided_  that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Seller), including their respective reasonable best efforts
to: (i) have management with appropriate seniority and expertise participate
in a reasonable number of meetings, rating agency presentations and due
diligence sessions with prospective lenders in connection with the Debt
Financing with appropriate advance notice; (ii) assist the Purchaser and its
Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of pertinent information regarding
the Seller and each Acquired Company related to (A) any offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information and similar documents and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, including, but not limited to
providing (1) the Audited Financial Statements, (2) such other financial
business and other information as the Purchaser shall reasonably request from
the Acquired Companies, including to the extent to allow Purchaser to prepare
pro forma consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of the
Acquired Companies that are necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that Purchaser, and not the
Seller or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, shall be
responsible for the preparation of the pro forma financial statements and any
other pro forma information, including any pro forma adjustments),

  



  

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(3) customary authorization letters (including customary representations with
respect to accuracy of information and material non-public information) for
inclusion in any bank information or materials that authorizes the
distribution of information to be distributed to prospective lenders and (4)
such other information as may be customary in connection with executing
financings of the type similar to the Debt Financing and reasonably requested
by Purchaser; (iii) assist with the pledging of collateral by the
Acquired Companies (including the execution and delivery by the Acquired
Companies of customary pledge and security documents); _provided_ , that any
such pledge or other encumbrances shall be authorized and only become
effective at, or as of, the Closing; (iv) obtain from the Seller's auditors
such reports as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and the consent
of such auditors to the use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Debt Financing; (v) facilitate the execution and delivery of definitive
financing documents, customary perfection certificates and other certificates
(including a solvency certificate in the form attached to the Debt Commitment
Letter) or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser, in each
case, with respect to information regarding each Acquired Company; _provided_
that no obligation of any Acquired Company under any document, agreement or
pledge shall be effective until the Closing, (vi) request consents, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by the Purchaser; (vii) request
customary payoff letters relating to the repayment of any existing
indebtedness to be repaid concurrently with the Closing and/or the
termination of any third party liens securing such indebtedness and
facilitate delivery to the Purchaser at the Closing of any possessory
collateral of the Acquired Companies held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
collateral agent under the Seller's existing credit facility; (viii) provide
customary documentation and other information with respect to the Acquired
Companies at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date as shall
have been reasonably requested by the Purchaser at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, that is required by regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and that are required by the
Debt Commitment Letter; and (ix) cooperate with the Debt Financing Sources'
"due diligence" investigation with respect to the Acquired Companies;
_provided_ that the Seller shall not be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other Liability in connection with the
Acquisition Financing prior to the Closing for which it is not reimbursed by
the Purchaser.

  



  

(c)   _Reimbursement; Indemnification_. The Purchaser shall,
promptly upon the written request of the Seller, reimburse the Seller for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses
incurred by the Seller or any of its Representatives in connection with the
cooperation provided for in _Section 5.06(b)_ (such reimbursement to be made
promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of delivery of
reasonably acceptable documentation evidencing such cost and expense) and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Representatives from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of Acquisition Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than written information provided by the Seller),
except to the extent such Losses result from intentional misconduct of the
Seller or any of its Representatives. The Seller shall notify the Purchaser
reasonably in advance of the Seller or any of its Representatives incurring
any third party costs and expenses in connection with the cooperation provided
for in _Section 5.06(b)_ in excess of $5,000, which notice shall include a
good faith estimate of the amount of such costs and expenses. All non-public
or otherwise confidential information regarding the Seller or any of its
Affiliates obtained by the Purchaser or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 5.06_ shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Seller, be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and
_Section 5.03_.

Section 5.07   _Names and Marks_.

  



  

(a)  The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that all right, title and
interest in and to the Retained Names and Marks are owned exclusively by the
Seller or one or more of its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies),
and that, except as expressly provided below, any and all right of the
Acquired Companies to use the Retained Names and Marks shall terminate as of
the Closing and shall immediately revert to the Seller or one or more of its
Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies). The Purchaser further
acknowledges that it has no rights, and is not acquiring any rights, to use
the Retained Names and Marks, except as provided herein.

  



  

(b)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (and in
any event within six (6) months thereafter), the Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Companies to cease and discontinue use of all Retained Names and
Marks from all products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical information
and promotional or other marketing materials of the Acquired Companies
existing as of the Closing that bear the Retained Names and Marks. The Seller
hereby grants the Acquired Companies a limited, non-exclusive license to
use the Retained Names and Marks on a wind-down and transitional basis for
the period specified in the preceding sentence in connection with such
specified assets. Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.07_ , no
other right to use the Retained Names and Marks is granted by the Seller to
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates whether by implication or otherwise,
and nothing hereunder shall permit the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to

and shall cause each Acquired Company to, ensure that all uses of the
Retained Names and Marks as provided in this _Section 5.07_  shall be only
with respect to goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater

used the Retained Names and Marks prior to the Closing. Any and all goodwill
generated by the use of the Retained Names and Marks under this _Section
5.07_ shall inure solely to the benefit of the Seller. The Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause each Acquired Company not to, (i) use the Retained Names
and Marks hereunder in any manner that may damage, impair or tarnish the
reputation of the Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies)
or the goodwill associated with the Retained Names and Marks; or (ii) contest
the ownership or validity of any of the Retained Names and Marks.

  



  

(c)  The Purchaser agrees that the Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Acquired Companies) shall have no responsibility for claims by
third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by the Acquired
Companies of any Retained Names and Marks after the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 5.07_
by the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies with respect to the Retained Names
and Marks, the Seller, in addition to any other remedies available to it,
shall be entitled to a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or
other equivalent relief restraining the Business or the Acquired Companies
from any such breach or threatened breach.

(d)  The Seller hereby acknowledges that all right, title and
interest in and to the Company Names and Marks are owned exclusively by the
Acquired Companies, and that, except as expressly provided below, any and all
right of the Seller, its Affiliates, and the Retained Subsidiaries to use the

Company Names and Marks, except as provided herein.

any event within six (6) months thereafter), the Seller shall cause the
Retained Subsidiaries to cease and discontinue use of all Company Names and
Marks from all products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical information
and promotional or other marketing materials of the Retained Subsidiaries
existing as of the Closing that bear the Company Names and Marks, and to file
name change documentation as may be necessary for any of the
Retained Subsidiaries to change its legal entity name to a name not including
"Grede" in whole or in part. The Purchaser, on behalf of the Acquired
Companies, hereby grants the Seller (on behalf of the Retained Subsidiaries) a
limited, non-exclusive license to use the Company Names and Marks on a wind-
down and transitional basis for the period specified in the preceding
sentence. Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.07_ , no other
right to use the Company Names and Marks is granted by the Purchaser to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether by implication or otherwise, and
nothing hereunder shall permit the Seller or any of its Affiliates to use the
Company Names and Marks in any manner. The Seller shall, and shall cause each
Retained Subsidiary to, ensure that all uses of the Company Names and Marks
as provided in this _Section 5.07_ shall be only with respect to goods and
services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods
and services with respect to which the Retained Subsidiaries used the Company
Names and Marks prior to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the
use of the Company Names and Marks under this _Section 5.07_ shall inure
solely to the benefit of the Purchaser. The Seller shall not, and shall
cause each Retained Subsidiary not to, (i) use the Company Names and Marks
hereunder in any manner that may damage, impair or tarnish the reputation of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or the
goodwill associated with the Company Names and Marks; or (ii) contest the
ownership or validity of any of the Company Names and Marks.

shall have no responsibility for claims by third parties arising out of, or
relating to, the use by the Retained Subsidiaries of any Company Names and

threatened breach of this _Section 5.07_ with respect to the Company Names
and Marks by the Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries, the Purchaser, in
addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to a
preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or other equivalent

which it is aware that it has determined will or is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  of this
Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied or being materially delayed;

covenant or agreement made in this Agreement.

any of its self-insurance programs, other than (i) insurance policies or self-
insurance programs acquired directly by and in the name of the Acquired
Companies or (ii) as set forth in _Section 5.10(b)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
shall retain all rights to control their insurance policies and

or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies
and programs notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to

(b)  From and after the Closing Date, with respect to any
Liability of an Acquired Company, to the extent arising out of any claim,
act, omission, event or circumstance occurring prior to the Closing, which is
insured under any of the Seller's insurance policies (including any workers'
compensation policy) (such policies, the " _Available Insurance Policies_
"), the Seller shall provide the Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired
Company) with access to, and the right to make claims under, the applicable
Available Insurance Policy in respect of such Liability; _provided_ , that
such access to, and the right to make claims under, such Available Insurance
Policy shall be subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of such
policy, including any limits on coverage or scope, and any deductibles, self-
insured retentions, retrospective premiums, and other chargeback
amounts, fees, costs and expenses, and shall be subject to the following:

  



  

(i)  if permitted under such Available Insurance Policy, the
Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired Company) shall be responsible for the
submission, administration and management of any claims under such Available
Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that the Purchaser shall provide reasonable
notice to the Seller prior to submitting any such claim;

  



  

   

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  if such Available Insurance Policy does not permit the
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies to directly submit claims under
such Available Insurance Policy, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
applicable Acquired Company to, report any potential claims under such
Available Insurance Policy as soon as practicable to the Seller and the Seller
shall, or shall cause any of its Affiliates to, submit such claims directly
to the applicable insurer; _provided_ that, with respect to any such claims,
the Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired Company) shall (x) be responsible
for (A) the preparation of any documents or forms that are required for the
submission of such claims and (B) the administration and management of such
claims after submission, and (y) provide the Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate) with such documents, forms, or other information necessary for the
submission of such claims by the Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) on
behalf of the Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired Company);

  



  

(iii)  the Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired Company) shall be

self-insured retentions, retrospective premiums and other chargeback amounts,
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, to
the extent resulting from any access to, or any claims made by the Purchaser
or any of the Acquired Companies under, any such Available Insurance Policy
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ , including any indemnity payments,
settlements, judgments, legal fees and allocated claims expenses and claim
handling fees, whether such claims are submitted directly or indirectly by
the Seller, an Affiliate of the Seller, its or their employees or third
parties;

  



  

(iv)  the Purchaser (or the applicable Acquired Company) shall
bear (and none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to repay or reimburse the Purchaser or any Acquired Company for)
and shall be liable for all excluded, uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or
uncollectible amounts of all such claims made by the Purchaser or the
applicable Acquired Company under such Available Insurance Policy; and

  



  

(v)  neither the Purchaser nor any of the Acquired Companies, in
connection with making a claim under any such Available Insurance Policy
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ , shall take any action that would be
reasonably likely to (x) have an adverse impact on the then-current
relationship between the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the applicable insurer, on the other hand, (y) result in the applicable
insurer terminating or reducing coverage to, or increasing the amount of any
premium owed by, the Seller or any of its Affiliates under such policy, or (z)
otherwise compromise, jeopardize or interfere with the rights of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates under such policy.

  



  

Section 5.11   _Privileged Matters; Conflicts Waiver_.

  



  

   

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a)  The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies following the Closing) (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Related Parties_ "), hereby waives, and agrees not to allege, any
claim that Shearman and Sterling LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from representing the Seller or any of its Representatives ("
_Seller Related Parties_ ") in any post-Closing matter or dispute with any of
the Purchaser Related Parties related to or involving this Agreement
(including the negotiation hereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby,
even though the interests of one or more of the Seller Related Parties in
such matter or dispute may be directly adverse to the interests of one or more
of the Purchaser Related Parties and even though Shearman and Sterling LLP may
have represented one or more of the Acquired Companies in a matter
substantially related to such matter or dispute.

  



  

(b)  The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and all other Purchaser
Related Parties, acknowledges and agrees that each of the Acquired Companies'
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection and expectation of
client confidence involving any proposed sale of the Acquired Companies or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (but not
general business matters of any of the Acquired Companies, to the extent they
are governed by _Section 5.11(c)_ ), and all information and documents
covered by such privilege, protection or expectation shall be retained and
controlled by the Seller and its Affiliates, and may be waived only by the
Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) the
foregoing attorney-client privilege, work product protection and expectation
of client confidence shall not be controlled, owned, used, waived or
claimed by the Purchaser or by any of the Acquired Companies upon
consummation of the Closing; and (ii) in the event of a dispute between the
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third
party, on the other hand, or any other circumstance in which a third party
requests or demands that any of the Acquired Companies produce privileged
materials or attorney work-product of the Seller or its Affiliates, the
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to assert such attorney-client
privilege on behalf of the Seller or its Affiliates to prevent disclosure of
privileged materials or attorney work-product to such third party.

  



  

(c)  The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree that:
(i) the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection and
expectation of client confidence and all other privileges and expectations of
client confidence to the extent owned by the Acquired Companies and involving
general business matters of any Acquired Company (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) and arising
prior to the Closing shall, after the Closing, continue to be owned by the
Acquired Companies, and the Purchaser or the applicable Acquired Company shall
have the right to control, assert or waive all such privileges and
protections; (ii) the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection and expectation of client confidence and all other privileges and
expectations of client confidence solely involving general business matters
of the business of the Seller and its Affiliates other than the Acquired
Companies or the Business (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) and arising prior to the
Closing shall, after the Closing, continue to be owned and controlled by the
Seller and its Affiliates, and the Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable,
shall have the right to control, assert or waive all such privileges and
protections; and (iii) to the extent that there are privileged materials
involving Business matters that directly involve both the Business and the
business of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby) that were created prior to the Closing but
that, after the Closing, continue to directly involve both the Business and
the business of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies),

  



  

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

such material shall, after the Closing, be subject to a joint privilege and
protection between the Seller, on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies,
on the other hand, and the Seller and the Acquired Companies shall have equal
right to assert all such joint privilege and protection and no such joint
privilege or protection may be waived by (i) the Seller or its Affiliates
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser; or (ii) any of the
Acquired Companies without the prior written consent of the Seller; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such privileged materials or protected
attorney-work product information, whether arising prior to, or after, the
Closing Date, with respect to any matter for which a party has an
indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be subject to the sole control of
such party, which shall be solely entitled to control the assertion or waiver
of the privilege or protection, whether or not such information is in the
possession of or under the control of such party.

  



  

(d)  This _Section 5.11_ is for the benefit of the Seller, the
Seller Related Parties and Shearman and Sterling LLP, and the Seller Related
Parties and Shearman and Sterling LLP are express third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 5.11_. This _Section 5.11_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of
this _Section 5.11_ may be amended, waived or modified, except in accordance
with _Section 11.07_ or _Section 11.08_ , as the case may be, and with the
prior written consent of Shearman and Sterling LLP and the Seller Related Party
affected thereby. This _Section 5.11_ shall survive the Closing and
shall remain in effect indefinitely.

  



  

Section 5.12   _Pre-Closing Mexico Reorganization Transactions_. Prior
to 11:59 p.m. New York time on the date immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Seller shall consummate, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates

the Pre-Closing Mexico Reorganization Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.13   _Further Action_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, from time to time, execute and deliver such
documents and take such other actions as shall be necessary under applicable
Law to render effective the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including delivering to the Purchaser as promptly as practicable, and
in any event within thirty (30) days, after the Closing any possessory
collateral of the Acquired Company held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
collateral agent under the Seller's existing credit facility as of the date
hereof (to the extent such possessory collateral is not delivered to the
Purchaser on the Closing Date)).

  



  

(b)  From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to, from time to
time, execute and deliver such documents and take such other actions as shall

shall be, at the Seller's sole discretion, settled, repaid, capitalized,
terminated or cancelled prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time on the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date. No Intercompany Agreement (including
any provision thereof which purports to survive termination) shall be of any
further force or effect after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the
intercompany agreements or accounts solely between and among any of
the Acquired Companies or set forth in _Schedule 5.14_ shall not be affected
by, or subject to, this _Section 5.14_.

  



  

   

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5.15   _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement, the Seller hereby
covenants and agrees that it will not, and will cause and instruct its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) not to, and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause and instruct its and their respective Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit or knowingly encourage, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any proposal relating
to, any Competing Transaction, (b) enter into discussions or negotiate with
any Person with respect to any Competing Transaction or (c) knowingly endorse
or agree to endorse, or enter into any definitive agreement with any Person
with respect to, any Competing Transaction. Promptly following the receipt of
any written inquiry, proposal or other communication (or any bona fide oral
inquiry, proposal or other communication) relating to a Competing Transaction
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Seller agrees
to notify the Purchaser of such receipt and provide a description, in
reasonable detail, of all material terms of such inquiry or proposals or, in
the case of any written inquiry or proposal, a copy thereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Competing Transaction" means any of the following: (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture,
partnership, or similar transaction (or series of transactions) involving any
of the Acquired Companies; (ii) any sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage,
pledge, transfer or other disposition of a material portion of the assets of
any of the Acquired Companies; (iii) any transaction contemplating either the
issuance by the Acquired Companies of any equity interests, or the
acquisition (directly or indirectly) by any Person of any of the any Acquired
Company's equity interests; or (iv) any similar transaction, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

  



  

Section 5.16   _Seller Credit Support Instruments_.

  



  

(a)  At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall use, and
shall cause its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Group_ ") to use,
reasonable best efforts to secure the unconditional release of the Seller and
each of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) from the Seller
Credit Support Instruments set forth on _Section 5.16(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (including, in the case of the Seller Credit Support
Instruments set forth in items 3 through 13 of _Section 5.16(a)_  of the
Disclosure Schedule, entry into back-to-back letter of credit arrangements
with the Debt Financing Sources and Bank of America, N.A.), and the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to be
substituted in all respects therefor (including through entry into such back-
to-back letter of credit arrangements), so that the applicable member of the
Purchaser Group shall be solely responsible for the obligations of such
Seller Credit Support Instruments. Without limiting the
Purchaser's undertaking in the foregoing sentence, to the extent that the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) have
performance obligations under any such Seller Credit Support Instrument set
forth on _Section 5.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule after the Closing, (a)
the Purchaser shall not permit any member of the Purchaser Group (including
the Acquired Companies) to renew or extend the term of, increase its
obligations under, or transfer to a third party, any such Seller Credit
Support Instrument, and (b) the Purchaser shall, or shall cause a member of
the Purchaser Group to, use reasonable best efforts to secure the
unconditional release of the Seller or such Affiliate of Seller from such
Seller Credit Support Instrument.

  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

In the event that any Seller Credit Support Instrument set forth on _Section
5.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule has not been terminated and that the
Seller or the relevant Affiliate (other than an Acquired Company) has not been
released as of the Closing Date, the Seller or the relevant Affiliate (other
than an Acquired Company) shall be permitted to terminate such Seller
Credit Support Instrument as promptly as practicable; _provided_ that such
termination does not result in termination of or a material change to the
Contract to which such Seller Credit Support Instrument applies, except in
connection with the end of any primary or renewal term of any such Contract
or Seller Credit Support Instrument. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause a member of the Purchaser Group to, promptly indemnify
and reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for any and all amounts drawn
from the Seller Credit Support Instruments set forth on _Section 5.16(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b)  From and after the date of this Agreement, the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser with the taking of
the actions required by the first sentence of _Section 5.16(a)_ , including
providing copies of the Seller Credit Support Instruments set forth on
_Section 5.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, coordinating with current
beneficiaries of such Seller Credit Support Instruments with negotiation of
substitute instruments and the return of such Seller Credit
Support Instruments promptly after any replacement is issued, and providing
reasonable administrative support to Purchaser and to Purchaser's financing
sources to replace such Seller Credit Support Instruments.

  



  

(c)   From and after the Closing, with respect to those Seller
Credit Support Instruments set forth in _Section 5.16(c)_  of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause a member of the Purchaser Group
to, promptly indemnify and reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for any
and all amounts drawn from such Seller Credit Support Instruments (including
any incremental increase in the costs to the Seller and its Affiliates of
maintaining such Seller Credit Support Instruments as a result of such draw
(including any increase in interest expense)) solely to the extent that (1)
such amounts are drawn as a direct result of any action, or any failure to
act, by an Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates following the Closing in
violation of any performance obligations in respect of the applicable workers
compensation claims to which such Seller Credit Support Instruments relate
and (2) such performance obligations are in respect of the Assumed
Liabilities.

  



  

Section 5.17   _Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a)  Except as permitted by this _Section 5.17_ or by any
Ancillary Agreement, for a period of four (4) years from the Closing Date,
the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in, own or operate any Competing Business; _provided_ that
nothing contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall preclude, prohibit or
restrict the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in any manner in
any Permitted Business.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall:

  



  

(i)  prohibit the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from
acquiring (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase, joint
venture or other similar transaction) or holding less than ten percent (10%)
of the outstanding shares of capital stock, outstanding partnership interests
or other outstanding equity interests in any Person or business that engages
in any Competing Business if the portion of such Person's or business's
consolidated revenue derived from such Competing Business during the calendar
year immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition constituted
less than five percent (5%) of such Person's or business's total consolidated
revenue during such calendar year; _provided_ such shares of capital stock,
partnership interests or equity interests are purchased and held solely for
investment purposes;

  



  

   

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  prohibit the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from
acquiring (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase, joint
venture or other similar transaction) or holding shares of capital stock or a
partnership or other equity interest in any Person or business that engages
in any Competing Business, if the portion of such Person's or business's total
consolidated revenue derived from such Competing Business during the calendar
year immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition constituted
less than twenty percent (20%) of such Person's or business's total
consolidated revenue during such calendar year; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if such Person's or business's total consolidated third party revenues in the
United States derived from such Competing Business during the calendar year
immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition exceeds $50
million, the Seller or its applicable Subsidiary shall liquidate, sell or
dispose (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase, joint
venture or other similar transaction) that portion of such Person or business
that constitutes a Competing Business as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within two (2) years after the acquisition thereof);

  



  

(iii)  prohibit or otherwise restrict the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries from complying with any Ancillary Agreement;

  



  

(iv)  prohibit or otherwise restrict the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries from selling, distributing, marketing or otherwise providing any
products or services not constituting Competing Business in the ordinary
course of the Seller's or such Subsidiary's business to a Person or business
engaged in the applicable Competing Business; or

  



  

(v)  be interpreted in any way to adversely affect, or restrict
the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from conducting, a Permitted Business.

  



  

(c)  The Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) it would be
difficult to calculate damages to the Purchaser from any breach of the
obligations under this _Section 5.17_ , (ii) injury to the Purchaser from any
such breach would be irreparable and impossible to measure and (iii) the
remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 5.17_ ,
including monetary damages, would therefore be an inadequate remedy and,
accordingly, the Purchaser shall have the right to specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights under this _Section 5.17_ ,
in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and
all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

(d)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section 5.17_
constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance
or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by the other Party.
The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the restrictive covenants and
other agreements contained in this _Section 5.17_ are an essential part of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. It is the intent of
the Parties that the provisions of this _Section 5.17_  shall be enforced to
the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in
each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Each of the Parties has
independently consulted with its counsel and, after such consultation, agrees
that the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.17_ are intended to be
reasonable and proper in scope, duration and geographical area and in all
other respects. If any such covenant is found to be invalid, void or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction by a final determination
of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, the
Parties agree that: (i) such determination shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of (A) the offending term or provision in any other situation
or in any other jurisdiction, or (B) the remaining terms and provisions of
this _Section 5.17_ in any situation in any jurisdiction; (ii) the offending
term or provision shall be reformed rather than voided and the court or
Governmental Authority making such determination shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or geographical area of any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or enforceable term or provision with a term or provision
that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision, in order to render
the restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section 5.17_ enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; and (iii) the restrictive
covenants set forth in this _Section 5.17_ shall be enforceable as so
modified.

  



  

(e)  This _Section 5.17_ is solely for the benefit of, and is
enforceable by, the Parties and shall not be deemed to confer upon any other
Person any remedy, benefit, claim, liability, reimbursement, claim of Action
or other right of any nature whatsoever.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to any Person acquiring, directly or indirectly (whether by merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase, joint venture or other similar
transaction), (x) twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding capital
stock or partnership or other equity interests in any of the Mexico
Subsidiaries or (y) assets, businesses, divisions or Subsidiaries that
constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Mexico Business, taken as a whole, such Person shall be
required to agree in writing that the acquired assets, businesses, divisions
or Subsidiaries of the Mexico Business (and not any other assets, businesses,
divisions or Subsidiaries of such Person) shall continue to be bound by the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.17_ that are applicable to the Mexico
Business as conducted by the Seller and its Subsidiaries at such time, and
the Purchaser shall be a third party beneficiary with respect to such
obligations of such Person.

  



  

(g)  As used in this _Section 5.17_ , the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

  



  

(i)  " _Competing Business_ " shall mean the business of
manufacturing and supplying un-machined ductile, gray, and specialty iron
castings and machined knuckles and control arms for automotive, commercial
vehicle, heavy truck, agriculture, construction, rail, wind energy
applications and other industrial applications in the United States.

(ii)  " _Permitted Business_ " shall mean:

  



  

(A)  any of the businesses operated, or offering any of the
products and services offered, by the Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than
the Acquired Companies) as of the date of this Agreement and which are
retained by the Seller and its Subsidiaries following the Closing (other than
any business, product or service that constitutes a Competing Business),
including the Driveline and Metal Forming business segments of the Seller (as
such business segments are conducted by the Seller and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Acquired Companies) as of the date of this Agreement and to
the extent such business segments are retained by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing);

  



  

(B)  the business of manufacturing and supplying the machined
knuckles and control arms set forth on Section 5.17(g)(ii)(B) of the
Disclosure Schedule, as such business is conducted by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) as of the date of this
Agreement (including any changes to such business after the date of this
Agreement in order to satisfy actual customer demand by customers of such
business of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Companies) as of the date of this Agreement);

  



  

(C)  the business of developing, manufacturing and supplying
ductile, gray, and specialty iron castings and machined components in Mexico
(the " _Mexico Business_ ");

  



  

(D)  the marketing or sale of any products or services to any
current or former customer of the Mexico Business, regardless of the location
of such customer (or the location of the applicable facility to which any such
product or service is being provided);  _provided_ that (x) such customer
requests that the Seller or its Subsidiaries provide such product or service
to such customer, and (y) at the time of such customer's request, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries possesses the tooling required to provide
the requested product or service; and

  



  

(E)  the development (whether in Mexico or not in Mexico) and
manufacturing in Mexico of any products or services that are supplied to the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries by the Mexico Business, and the supply of
such products or services to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in the
United States by the Mexico Business; _provided_ that, after such products or
services are supplied by the Mexico Business to the Seller and its
Subsidiaries in the United States, Seller and its Subsidiaries' use of such
products or services shall remain subject to the terms of this _Section 5.17_
; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section
5.17(g)_ to the contrary, the development, manufacturing and supply of
products or services by the Mexico Business to Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Exhibit B of the Supply
Arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
not use a third party to machine any castings that are supplied to the Seller

Companies) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make capital
expenditures in respect of the Business in an aggregate amount no less than

 EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  



  

Section 6.01   _Transfer of Employment_.

  



  

(a)  The employment relationship of each Business Employee who
is immediately prior to the Closing employed by the Acquired Companies, other
than those individuals set forth on _Section 1.01(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, shall continue with the applicable Acquired Company on and
following the Closing (each, a " _Transferred Employee_ ").

  



  

(b)  Each Transferred Employee shall during the period
commencing at the Closing and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing (or the termination of the relevant Transferred Employee, if earlier)
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), be employed on substantially equivalent
terms and conditions of employment in the aggregate as in effect prior to the
Closing and be provided with: (i) a base salary or rate of pay that is no less
than the base salary or rate of pay as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing; and (ii) target annual bonus opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the target annual bonus opportunities,
including under any long-term incentive plans, as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing, including being paid the full amount of such Transferred
Employee's portion of the bonuses described in clause (iv) of the definition
of "Specified Items."

  



  

   

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Transferred Employees shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided with
employee benefits (excluding any of those employee benefits set forth on
_Section 6.01(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Acquired Companies or
the Seller (or any applicable Affiliate) to such Transferred Employee under
the Company Plans and Seller Plans as of immediately prior to the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Transferred Employee
covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, the terms and conditions of
such Transferred Employee's employment shall be governed by the applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement (which may include participation in
compensation plans permitted under such Collective Bargaining Agreement and
applicable Law).

  



  

Section 6.02   _Employee Obligations_.

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise would result in the duplication of
compensation or benefits, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause any applicable
Affiliate to, provide credit to Transferred Employees under the types of plans
set forth on _Section 6.02(a)(i)_  of the Disclosure Schedule that cover
Transferred Employees after the Closing (if the Purchaser or its Affiliates
choose to maintain such plans after the Closing) for their years of service
recognized by the Acquired Companies or the Seller (or any
applicable Affiliate) as of the Closing for purposes of eligibility and
vesting, and with respect to the types of plans set forth on
_Section 6.02(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule only (if the Purchaser or
its Affiliates choose to maintain such plans after the Closing), determining
the level of benefits to the same extent and for the same purposes as such
service was credited under the Company Plans or Seller Plans prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b)  The Purchaser shall, or shall cause any applicable
Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods for Transferred Employees
(or any applicable dependent) under the group health plans maintained by the
Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate in which such employees are eligible to
participate after Closing, to the same extent such condition or exclusion was
waived or satisfied with respect to an individual Transferred Employee (or any
applicable dependent) prior to the Closing. With respect to the plan year
during which the Closing occurs, the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Transferred Employee with
credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the
Closing in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any group health plan of the Purchaser or of an applicable Affiliate in
which such Transferred Employee is eligible to participate following the
Closing, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits.

  



  

(c)  Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the
Seller shall take all action necessary to establish new Company Plans under
which Business Employees will be eligible to participate and that will be
effective prior to or as of the Closing Date, including: (i) a Company Plan
that is a defined contribution retirement plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code with a plan design that substantively mirrors
(subject to any design changes implemented pursuant to the last sentence
of this _Section 6.02(c)_ ) the plan designs of the American Axle and
Manufacturing, Inc. Salaried Savings Plan and the American Axle and
Manufacturing, Inc. Personal Savings Plan for Hourly-Rate Associates (the "
_New 401(k) Plan_ "); and (ii) Company Plans that mirror or are substantially
similar to each Seller Plan that is: (x) an "employee welfare benefit plan"
as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which Business Employees are eligible
to participate as of the date hereof; and (y) a cafeteria plan qualifying
under Section 125 of the Code that provides for flexible spending accounts
(collectively, the " _New Plans_ ").

  



  

   

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Seller and its Affiliates shall provide information regarding the New Plans
to Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser, including the terms of the
New Plans and any Contract related to such New Plans, including with respect
to the costs payable by any Acquired Company. The Seller shall consult with
the Purchaser with respect to determining the design of the New 401(k) Plan to
be in effect for the plan year beginning January 1, 2020, and shall implement
the design changes set forth in Section 6.02(c) of the Disclosure Schedule
and consider in good faith the implementation of such other design changes to
the New 401(k) Plan as the Purchaser shall request effective January 1, 2020.

  



  

(d)  Except as expressly provided in _Section 6.02(e)_ , the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for any and all Losses and
Liabilities arising prior to, on or after the Closing with respect to any
Business Employees' employment or termination of employment, in each case
including (i) any statutory and non-statutory severance obligations, and any
other termination payment obligations owed to the Business Employees whether
pursuant to an agreement, plan, practice or policy, or applicable Law; and
(ii) Losses or Liabilities incurred on account of the Purchaser's failure to
continue comparable employment for the Transferred Employees. On and after
Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for any and all
Losses and Liabilities related to tuition reimbursement and relocation
expenses for the Transferred Employees under the applicable Seller Plans,
including making any payments to Transferred Employees and reimbursing Seller
and its Affiliates for any costs expensed to the Seller or its Affiliates on
and after the Closing. The Purchaser and its relevant Affiliates shall be
responsible for all Losses and Liabilities arising on, prior to, or after the
Closing under all Company Plans (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include the New Plans), except as set forth under Section 6.02(e), and the
bonuses described in clause (iv) of the definition of "Specified Items". With
respect to this reimbursement and any reimbursement under this _Article VI_ ,
the Seller shall bill the Purchaser via a written notice itemizing in
reasonable detail the amounts to be reimbursed. Unless otherwise provided in
the applicable written notice, all payments required to be made pursuant to
this _Article VI_ shall be made in immediately available funds and will be
due sixty (60) days after the receipt of notice of such payment. With respect
to any payment required to be made or received under this _Article VI_ , the
Seller has the right to designate, by written notice to the Purchaser, which
Affiliate of the Seller or third party will receive such payment.

  



  

(e)  The Seller and its Affiliates shall retain the sponsorship
of all Seller Plans, and be solely responsible for all Losses and Liabilities
under any Seller Plan or any Employee Plan (other than any Company Plan or as
provided in _Section 6.02(d)_  with respect to tuition reimbursement and
relocation expenses under the applicable Seller Plans or _Section 6.03_ ),
including any Employee Plan at any time maintained, sponsored, contributed
to, or required to be contributed to by Brillion. The Seller and its relevant
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall be responsible for all
Losses and Liabilities for any health insurance claims incurred by Business
Employees, retirees of the Business other than as provided under _Section
6.07,_ or their covered dependents, on or prior to the Closing under: (i) all
Seller Plans; and (ii) all Company Plans for the amount of any individual
health insurance claim that is in excess of $250,000. For purposes of this
paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred when the services that are the subject
of the claim are performed. The Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) shall have and retain all Liabilities for and related to
the provision of continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code ("
_COBRA_ ") for any Person whose "qualifying event" (as defined in Section
4980B(f)(3) of the Code) occurred prior to or as of the date hereof.

  



  

   

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If a Business Employee or dependent or beneficiary thereof experiences a
"qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) and such
event occurs prior to the effective date of the New Plan that is a group
health plan established pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired Companies) shall be responsible for
all Liabilities for and related to the provision of continuation coverage
under COBRA for such Business Employee or dependent or beneficiary. If a
Business Employee (other than any Business Employee set forth on _Section
1.01(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) or dependent or beneficiary thereof
experiences a "qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the
Code) and such event occurs on or following the effective date of the New
Plan that is a group health plan established pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_
, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing
continuation coverage under COBRA and the payment of such benefits for such
Business Employee or dependent or beneficiary; except that the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired Companies) shall be responsible
for the amount of any individual health insurance claim that is in excess of
$250,000 incurred by any such COBRA participant during the period on or
following the effective date of the New Plan established pursuant to Section
6.02(c) that is a group health plan and on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.03   _Severance Benefits_. As of the Closing, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, expressly assume and honor the
obligations under the severance plan listed in _Section 6.03_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 6.04   _Equity Plans_. The Seller agrees and acknowledges that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a
termination of employment under the equity plans of the Seller. Any
outstanding equity award held by Transferred Employees will be treated in
accordance with its terms and the terms of the Seller Plan applicable to such
award. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be solely responsible for
all Liabilities under the equity plans of the Seller. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller and its Affiliates, other than the Acquired Companies, shall
cause all outstanding Seller equity awards and other equity-based awards held
by Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Seller Equity Awards_ ") to, immediately prior to the Closing, vest fully
(and, with respect to any such Seller Equity Awards that vest fully or in
part based on the achievement of applicable performance goals, assuming the
achievement of such performance goals at target).

  



  

Section 6.05   _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. As of and following the
Closing Date, the Seller and its Affiliates shall have no Liability with
respect to the Company Plans that are defined benefit pension plans subject to
Title IV of ERISA and set forth on  _Section 3.16(d)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_ "), whether for periods
arising before, on, or after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller and its Affiliates will have no obligation to reimburse the Purchaser
or its Affiliates for any service charges with respect to the Defined Benefit
Pension Plans.

  



  

Section 6.06   _Workers Compensation_. As of the Closing Date, each
Transferred Employee shall be eligible for coverage under the Purchaser's (or
an applicable Affiliate's) workers' compensation insurance, and the Purchaser
shall be liable for all workers' compensation claims incurred prior to, as
of, or following the Closing Date.

  



  

   

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 6.07   _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. The Purchaser shall
cause the applicable Acquired Company to honor any Collective Bargaining
Agreements. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the
applicable Acquired Company to, be solely responsible for all duties,
obligations and Liabilities (including retiree welfare benefits) arising under
the Collective Bargaining Agreements, whether arising prior to, on or
following the Closing Date. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it has been
notified of the existence of each of the Collective Bargaining Agreements set
forth in _Section 3.17(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any Transferred Employee who is, or becomes, subject to
a Collective Bargaining Agreement, all compensation and benefits treatment
and terms and conditions of employment afforded to such Transferred Employee
shall be provided in accordance with such applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.08   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or
implied in this _Article VI_ or in the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits
referred to hereby shall confer upon any of the Business Employees or any
other Person any rights or remedies, including any right to employment, or
continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or
does: (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or
otherwise) or any other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program,
Contract, agreement or arrangement of the Seller, its Affiliates, an Acquired
Company or the Purchaser, and no person participating in any such plan,
policy, program, Contract, agreement or arrangement maintained by the Seller,
its Affiliates, an Acquired Company or the Purchaser shall have any claim
or cause of action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provision of
this Agreement as it relates to any such plan, policy, program, Contract,
agreement or arrangement or otherwise, or (ii) limit the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates' (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies')
ability to: (A) terminate the employment or service of any Person at any time
and for any and no reason, or (B) amend, modify, or terminate any Employee
Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program, Contract,
agreement or arrangement of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  



  

Article VII 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.01   _Tax Indemnities_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing and subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 9.05_ , the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser
against any and all Excluded Acquired Company Taxes and any reasonable
attorneys' fees and other costs of defense relating thereto; _provided_ that
the Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser against (i) any
Tax imposed with respect to the Acquired Companies to the extent that any such
Tax was reflected as a Current Liability or Transaction Expense on the Final
Closing Statement, (ii) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies for any
Post-Closing Period or any post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period as set
forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ ,

  



  

   

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies which arise from any action
or transaction outside the ordinary course of business taken by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing, (iv)
any Taxes arising out of or resulting from any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser contained in this _Article VII_ , (v) any
Taxes arising out of amounts includible by the Acquired Companies under
Sections 951 and 951A of the Code to the extent attributable to the portion
of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date (determined on a closing
of the books basis), and (vi) any reasonable attorneys' fees or other costs
of defense relating to clauses (i) through (v) herein.

  



  

(b)  In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period shall be:

  



  

(i)  in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or
related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving
effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if
the taxable period ended on the date of the Closing; _provided_ that all
amounts paid to a Transferred Employee pursuant to an outstanding equity
award on or before the Closing Date shall be allocable to the Pre-Closing
Period to the extent permitted by applicable Law; and

  



  

(ii)  in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the assets of the taxpayer, or otherwise measured by the level of
any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
(after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against
such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes
for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this
paragraph (b) taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund
relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to
be allocated under this _Section 7.01(b)_ shall be computed by reference to
the level of such items on the date of the Closing. All determinations
necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c)  Payment by the Seller of any amount due under this _Section
7.01_ shall be made within twenty (20) days following written notice by the
Purchaser that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is
due, _provided_ that the Purchaser shall comply with its obligation to
promptly notify the Seller under _Section 7.03(a)_ and _provided further_
 that the Seller shall be required to make any payment at least three (3)
days before such amounts are due to the appropriate Taxing Authority (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a Tax is not due or payable
to the extent that such Tax may be contested prior to payment by the means
selected by the party entitled to control such contest). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, if the Seller receives an assessment or
other notice of Taxes due with respect to the Acquired Companies for any Pre-
Closing Period for which the Seller is not responsible,

  



  

   

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

in whole or in part, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 7.01_ , then
the Purchaser shall pay such Taxes, or if the Seller pays such Taxes, then
the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall pay to the Seller the amount of
such Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within five (5) days
following such payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 7.03_ , payment of the Tax to the appropriate
Taxing Authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a
final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Taxing
Authority.

  



  

(d)  If the amount of a Tax that was reflected as a Current
Liability on the Final Closing Statement is discharged or satisfied below the
amount attributed to such Tax in the Final Closing Statement, the Purchaser
shall pay the amount of such excess to the Seller within five (5) days after
the date of such discharge or satisfaction. For purposes of this _Section
7.01(d)_ , a Tax will be considered to be discharged or satisfied at the time
that the applicable Tax Return is filed.

  



  

Section 7.02   _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited by a Taxing Authority with respect
thereto) relating to Excluded Acquired Company Taxes (but only to the extent
that (a) such refund, credit or similar benefit is not reflected as a Current
Asset on the Final Closing Statement and (b) such refund, credit or similar
benefit is not attributable to, and does not result from, a carry back or
other use of any item of loss, deduction, credit or other similar
item arising in a Post-Closing Period) shall be the property of the Seller,
and if received by the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies shall be paid over
promptly to the Seller, net of any costs, expense or Taxes incurred by the
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies as a result of obtaining or receiving
such refund, credit or similar benefit. The Purchaser shall, if the Seller so
requests and at the Seller's expense, cause the relevant Acquired Company to
file for and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the receipt of
any refund to which the Seller is entitled under this _Section 7.02_ ;
_provided that_ (i) such obligation shall be limited to filing amended Tax
Returns or filing of Tax Returns to obtain refunds of overpayments of
estimated Taxes and (ii) neither Purchaser nor any Acquired Company shall be
required to (A) take any position on such Tax Return that is not at least at
a "more likely than not" level of comfort, (B) perform any study (e.g., in
respect of Tax credits or transfer pricing) or (C) take any position that
would bind Purchaser or the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date,
including in respect of any method of accounting. The Purchaser shall permit
the Seller to participate in (at the Seller's expense) the prosecution of any
such refund claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations provided in
this _Section 7.02_ shall not limit the parties' rights and obligations
described in _Section 7.05_.

  



  

Section 7.03   _Contests_.

  



  

(a)  After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Seller in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on
the Business, the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies
which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time,
could be grounds for indemnification by the Seller under _Section 7.01_. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the
Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies) describing the
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability. If the Purchaser fails to give the Seller prompt
notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this _Section 7.03_ ,
then the Seller shall not be released from any of its obligations under this
_Article VII_ , except to the extent the Seller is materially prejudiced by
such failure.

  



  

   

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that relates to Pre-Closing Periods, the Seller
shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such
Contest;  _provided_ that (i) the Seller shall keep the Purchaser reasonably
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Contest and
(ii) if the settlement or compromise of such Contest would be expected to
increase the Taxes of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) in a Post-Closing Period, or bind the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or any Acquired Company to a Tax position with respect to any
Post-Closing Period, then the Seller shall not enter into such settlement or
compromise without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Seller's right to control
a Contest shall be limited to amounts in dispute which would be paid by the
Seller or for which the Seller would be liable pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  With respect to Straddle Periods (other than a Contest
described in _Section 7.03(d)_ ), the Seller may elect to direct and control
any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which
indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to _Section 7.01_ through
counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. If the Seller elects to direct a
Contest, the Seller shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of
asserted Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so and keep
the Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Contest. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest and
so notifies the Purchaser within such thirty (30)-day period, the Purchaser or
any of the Acquired Companies may assume control of such Contest and keep the
Seller reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
such Contest. Any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any
such Contest shall be borne by each Party's shared expense in proportion to
the Tax liabilities finally determined with respect to such Contest that are
allocable to the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such Straddle
Period, provided that, if such liability as finally determined is zero, such
expenses shall be shared equally by the Parties. In either case, the
controlling party may not settle or compromise any asserted liability without
prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Seller shall have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
participate in, any Contest with respect to (i) any Tax Return of the Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) and (ii) any
Tax Return of an Affiliated Group of which the Seller is a member.

  



  

(e)  The Purchaser and the Seller agree to reasonably cooperate,
and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to reasonably
cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Contest.

  



  

   

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this _Section 7.03_ shall control with respect to any Contest.

  



  

Section 7.04   _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a)  The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause the Acquired
Companies to prepare and file) (i) all Tax Returns relating to the Business
and each of the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Periods (other than
Straddle Periods) and (ii) all Tax Returns of an Affiliated Group of which
the Seller is a member. The Seller shall promptly pay to the proper Taxing
Authority all Taxes shown as due and payable on all Tax Returns that are
prepared by the Seller pursuant to this _Section 7.04(a)_ ; _provided_  that
the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date of each such Tax Return (taking into account extensions thereof)
the portion of the Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Return that were
reserved for on the Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(b)  The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Acquired
Companies to prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate to the Business
and the Acquired Companies (other than any Tax Return of a consolidated,
combined, unitary, or affiliated Tax group of which the Seller is a member)
for Post-Closing Periods (including Straddle Periods), it being understood
that all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the
responsibility of the Purchaser (including any Taxes reserved for on the
Final Closing Statement), except for such Taxes which are the responsibility
of the Seller pursuant to _Section 7.01_ which the Seller shall pay in
accordance with this _Article VII_. Such Tax Returns for Straddle Periods
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law or this
Agreement. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed with respect
to the Business or any of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period, the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a copy of such completed Tax Return
and a statement (with which the Purchaser will make available supporting
schedules and information) certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax
Return that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to _Section 7.01_ at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for
filing of such Tax Return (provided for any such Tax Return filed on a semi-
annual or more frequent basis, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to
such due date), and such Tax Return shall not be filed until the Seller has
consented to the filing of such Tax Return (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and if the Seller has not given
such consent by the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return, such
consent shall be deemed to have been given. The Seller and the Purchaser
agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as
a result of the review of such Tax Return and statement by the Seller. In the
event that a Tax Return for a Straddle Period reflects any Tax refund, credit,
net operating loss or similar benefit, the provisions of _Section 7.02_
(relating to Tax refunds) shall control.

  



  

(c)  The Seller and the Purchaser shall make (or cause any of
their respective Affiliates to make) any election available under applicable
Law to treat the Closing Date as the end of a relevant taxable period.

  



  

Section 7.05   _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
filing any Tax election, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes.

Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective
employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this _Section
7.05_. Any information obtained under this _Section 7.05_  shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.05_ or
_Section 5.02 _ shall require the Seller to provide to the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of the Purchaser any consolidated, combined, unitary, or affiliated
Tax Returns which include any non-Acquired Company; _provided however_ , that
upon request by the Purchaser, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide relevant pro forma Tax Returns of any Acquired Company, if
such pro forma Tax Returns are in the possession of the Seller, pursuant to
this _Section 7.05_.

  



  

Section 7.06   _Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
each be liable for fifty percent (50%) of any and all Conveyance Taxes that

Seller shall be responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of any and all
Conveyance Taxes imposed on or payable or collectible or incurred in
connection with, the Pre-Closing Mexico Reorganization Transactions. The
Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of
all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Purchaser to comply
with any pre-Closing filing requirements, including value added Tax invoices.

(a)  Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser
shall, unless required by Law, (i) amend, refile or otherwise modify, or
cause or permit any of the Acquired Companies to amend, refile or otherwise
modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period, (ii) file a Tax Return of any of the Acquired Companies for a Pre-
Closing Period in a jurisdiction where such Acquired Company has not
previously filed a Tax Return, (iii) grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to a Tax Return of any Acquired Company
for a Pre-Closing Period, or (iv) except as described on _Schedule 7.07_
, enter into any voluntary disclosure Tax program, agreement or arrangement
with any Taxing Authority that relates to the Taxes of any of the Acquired
Companies, or (v) carry back any Tax Attribute of any of the Acquired
Companies from a Post-Closing Period to any Pre-Closing Period of an
Affiliated Group of which the Seller is a member, in each case, which could
reasonably be expected to cause the Seller to be liable for any amounts under
_Section 7.01_ or to any Taxing Authority, without the prior written consent
of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  



  

(b)  Except as set forth in _Section 7.09_ below, the Purchaser
shall not make, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) not to make, any election with respect to any Acquired Company
(including any election pursuant to Regulations Section 301.7701-3), which
election would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 7.08   _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a)  For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments
made under this _Article VII_ , under any other indemnity provisions
contained in this Agreement, and for breaches of representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements as adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital
contributions.

  



  

(b)  For purposes of this _Article VII_ , all references to the
Purchaser, the Seller, Affiliates and the Acquired Companies include
successors.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
_Article VII_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until
the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in
question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof), plus thirty
(30) days.

  



  

(d)  Payments by the Seller under this _Article VII_ shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
recovered by the Purchaser, the Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries
or any Affiliates of the Purchaser from any third party with respect thereto,
and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
pursue recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy for any Loss for which full or
partial recovery may be available thereunder, prior to receiving any payments
by the Seller under this _Article VII_ for such Loss.

  



  

Section 7.09   _338(h)(10) Elections_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties hereby agree that the Purchaser and the Seller
(or its applicable Subsidiary) shall timely make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any such similar elections as may be available
under applicable state or local Laws) with respect to the sale of the Units
under this Agreement and with respect to the deemed sale of the stock of each
Acquired Subsidiary that is classified as an association taxed as a
corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes (together, the " _Elections_
"). Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other in the preparation and
completion of IRS Form 8023, in the filing of such completed form before the
filing due date, and in the timely completion and filing of all other forms
required to effect the Elections and to take all other steps necessary in
order to effectuate the Elections in accordance with applicable Laws. Unless
required by applicable Law, (1) each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates to, report, act and file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Elections, and (2) no Party shall
take any position that is inconsistent with the Elections.

  



  

(b)  Within sixty (60) days after the determination of the Final
Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.07_ , the Purchaser shall provide
the Seller with a proposed allocation of the "adjusted grossed up basis" in
the Units (within the meaning of the Regulations under Section 338 of the
Code) among the tangible and intangible assets of the Acquired Companies in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Regulations for the Seller's
review and comment (the " _Allocation_ ").

  



  

   

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If the Seller does not provide any comments to the Purchaser in writing
within thirty (30) days following delivery by the Purchaser of the proposed
Allocation, then the Allocation proposed by the Purchaser shall be deemed to
be final and binding, absent manifest error. If, however, the Seller submits
comments to the Purchaser within such thirty (30)-day period, the Purchaser
and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences
within twenty (20) days. If Seller and the Purchaser agree in writing on any
revisions to such proposed Allocation, the Allocation, as subsequently agreed
and revised, shall be deemed to be final and binding, absent manifest error
(any such allocation, if deemed final and binding on the Parties, an " _Agreed
Allocation_ "). If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to reach a
resolution within such twenty (20)-day period, then the proposed
Allocation shall not be binding on either Party, and each Party shall be
entitled to file its Tax Returns in a manner consistent with its own
position. If there is an Agreed Allocation, upon any subsequent adjustments to
the sum of the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes, the Purchaser shall prepare an
updated Allocation in a manner consistent with this _Section 7.09(b)_ ,
Section 338 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. For all Tax purposes,
the Purchaser and the Seller agree that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reported in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, including any Agreed Allocation, if any, and that neither of them
will take any position inconsistent with any Agreed Allocation in any Tax
Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise. The Seller and
the Purchaser agree to consult, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
consult, with one another with respect to any Tax audit, controversy or
litigation relating to any Agreed Allocation by the IRS or another Taxing
Authority (it being understood that, notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this _Article VII_ to the contrary, in the event the IRS or any
other Taxing Authority challenges any position taken by any Party relating to
any Allocation, whether or not it is an Agreed Allocation, such Party may
settle or litigate such challenge without the consent of, or liability to,
the other Party).

  



  

(c)  The Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser shall cause itself
(or, if the Purchaser assigns this Agreement or its rights to acquire the
Units under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Purchaser, such Affiliate
that so acquires the Units) to be classified as a domestic corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the Closing Date and to be treated as a
domestic corporation and as a member of an affiliated group (as defined in
Section 1504 of the Code) of which TopCo is also a member for purposes
of making the Elections.

for and against all Liabilities, taxes, losses, damages, costs and expenses,
interest, fines, awards, judgments, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9.05   _Limits on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) no Losses may be claimed under or shall be reimbursable under
_Section 9.03(c)_ and the Seller shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant
to _Section 9.03(c)_  unless such Losses are in excess of $50,000 resulting
from any single claim or series of related claims arising out of the
same facts, events or circumstances, (ii) the Seller shall not be liable for
any Losses pursuant to _Section 9.03(d)_ or _Section 9.03(e)_ , unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from
the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.03(d)_ and _Section 9.03(e)_ , in the
aggregate, exceeds $1,500,000, whereupon the Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such Losses in excess of such amount; (iii)
no Losses may be claimed under _Section 9.03(d)_ or _Section 9.03(e)_ or
shall be reimbursable by or shall be included in calculating the aggregate
Losses set forth in _clause (ii)_  above other than Losses in excess of
$50,000 resulting from any single claim or series of related claims arising
out of the same facts, events or circumstances; and (iv) the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of, or resulting from, the causes
set forth in _Section 9.03(d)_ and _Section 9.03(e)_ , in the aggregate,
shall be an amount equal to $32,750,000.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no Losses may be claimed under or shall be reimbursable under
_Section 9.04(c)_ and the Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses
pursuant to _Section 9.04(c)_  unless such Losses are in excess of $50,000
resulting from any single claim or series of related claims arising out of the
same facts, events or circumstances.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, after the Closing, none of the Parties and none of their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for (i) any incidental, consequential or indirect damages,
including loss of future profits, revenue or income, diminution in value or
loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to any indemnifiable Loss
under _Section 9.03_ , _Section 9.04_ or otherwise, regardless of
whether such damages were foreseeable (except (A) to the extent necessary to
reimburse an Indemnified Party hereunder for any such damages awarded to a
third party in connection with a Third Party Claim, or (B) with respect to any
indemnifiable Loss under _Section 9.03(a)_ that results from a breach by the
Seller of _Section 5.17_ or _Section 5.18_ hereof, if such damages are the
natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of such breach of _Section
5.17_ or _Section 5.18_ ), or (ii) any special or punitive damages (except to
the extent necessary to reimburse an Indemnified Party hereunder for any such
damages awarded to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim).

  



  

(d)  To the extent the Purchaser Indemnified Parties suffer a
Loss that is both (x) recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy and (y)
according to the relevant Purchaser Indemnified Party's determination, subject
to indemnification under _Section 9.03_ by the Seller (a " _Recoverable Loss_
"), then the Seller may request from the Purchaser that the Purchaser shall,
and if the Seller so requests the Purchaser shall be obligated to, first seek
to recover the Recoverable Loss under the RandW Insurance Policy prior to
recovering from the Seller with respect to such Recoverable Loss under
_Section 9.03_ ; _provided_  that, if (A) the Seller requests that the
Purchaser shall first seek to recover the Recoverable Loss under the RandW
Insurance Policy, and (B) the amount of the applicable Recoverable Loss
exceeds the coverage available for such Recoverable Loss pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy, then (I) the Purchaser shall seek to recover the coverage
that is available under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to the
Recoverable Loss and (II) the Purchaser may, in its discretion, simultaneously
seek to recover from the Seller with respect to such Recoverable Loss under
_Section 9.03_.

  



  

   

 | 86| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If the Seller requests that the Purchaser shall first seek to recover the
Recoverable Loss under the RandW Insurance Policy pursuant to the prior
sentence, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the
Seller shall have no right to assume or control the negotiation and defense
of such Recoverable Loss or the underlying Third Party Claim (if any) and (ii)
the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in pursuing such Recoverable Loss under the RandW
Insurance Policy shall also be deemed an indemnifiable Loss of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 9.03_ to the extent the claim for
such Recoverable Loss under the RandW Insurance Policy is denied and the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are awarded indemnification from the Seller
pursuant to _Section 9.03_ with respect to such Recoverable Loss. The amount
of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder or of any claim therefor
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Parties on account of such Loss (net of any deductible or other
costs or expenses of recovery, including any increase in premiums or retro-
premiums). In the event that an insurance recovery is made by any Indemnified
Parties with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery actually received by such Indemnified Party shall be made promptly to
the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(e)  The parties agree to comply with the obligations set forth
in Section 9.05(e) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 9.06   _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a)  An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
written notice in reasonable detail of any matter which an Indemnified Party
has determined has given rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, within thirty (30) days of such determination, including all facts
and circumstances that give rise to such right of indemnification, the amount
of the Loss, if known (and, if not known, an estimate of the amount of
potential Losses), and the method of computation thereof, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

(b)  If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action,
audit, claim, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against
it which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this _Article IX_ , within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it, as a condition to the assumption, gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Indemnified Party as promptly as possible but in any event
within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Party.

  



  

   

 | 87| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at
its own expense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified Party has been advised
in writing by counsel that there exists or there is reasonably likely to
exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party and its independent counsel for
the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel
(and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) at its own expense;
_provided_ , _further_ that, subject to _Section 9.08_ , the
Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to assume and control the
defense of any Third Party Claim (i) that seeks as the sole remedy an
injunction or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or (ii) if
the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation. The Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and use
reasonable best efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall settle
or compromise any Third Party Claim, or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of
the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle any Third Party Claim if (x) the Indemnified Party is provided written
notice of the Indemnifying Party's intention to settle the Third Party Claim
at least ten (10) calendar days prior to such settlement and (y) the
Indemnified Party is given an unconditional, full and complete written
release from any and all liability by all relevant parties in respect of such
Third Party Claim or the Losses payable under the settlement are limited
solely to monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is fully

witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Seller's
possession or under the Seller's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Purchaser.

set forth in Section 9.06(d) of the Disclosure Schedule.

and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties (including the Purchaser and

contemplated hereby, (ii) neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall be liable
or responsible in any manner whatsoever (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) to any Indemnified Party for a breach of this Agreement or in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except

(iii) each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (A) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or (B) otherwise relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, in each case, that it may have against the other Party and its
Representatives arising under or based upon any applicable Law (including
Environmental Law), including any and all rights, claims or causes of
action for contribution or other relief, reimbursement or compensation under
the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
or any analogous state act, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions

_Section 9.03(f)_ for the matters described in items 1, 4 and 6 of
Section 9.03(f) of the Disclosure Schedule:

  



  

(i)  the Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to conduct and control the Remedial Action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,
if the Seller opts to conduct such Remedial Action, the Seller shall do so
without unreasonably interfering with the applicable Acquired Company's
operations;

  



  

(ii)  to exercise its right to conduct and control the Remedial
Action, the Seller must provide the Purchaser, within 30 days of receiving

shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to: (A) receive copies of
all reports, work plans and analytical data submitted to Governmental

the Seller is conducting and controlling the Remedial Action, the Seller
shall obtain the Purchaser's consent prior to undertaking any material action
with respect to such Remedial Action that could reasonably be expected to
significantly impact the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the subject real
property, _provided that_ such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall not
be required to consent to anything that could reasonably be expected to
unreasonably interfere with the applicable Acquired Company's operations);

  



  

(iv)  during the period the Seller is conducting and controlling
the Remedial Action, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Seller, including by

cost-effective manner, which may incorporate (A) any risk-based clean-up
standards that, based upon the use classification (industrial, commercial or
residential) of the applicable Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property,
are allowed under applicable Environmental Law and approved by or otherwise
acceptable to the applicable Governmental Authorities; and (B) any reasonably
cost-effective methods that are allowed under applicable Environmental Law and
that are approved by or otherwise acceptable to applicable Governmental
Authorities to achieve such standards, including the use of engineering and
institutional controls to eliminate or minimize exposure pathways, in each
case of (A) and (B) to the extent such standards or methods do not
unreasonably interfere with the applicable Acquired Company's operations. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for any operation and maintenance of any such
institutional or engineering controls subsequent to completion of their
installation, and such post-installation costs shall not be subject to
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall remain
responsible for the operation and maintenance of any such control that
entails removing or reducing Hazardous Substances from soil, groundwater, air
or other environmental media.

  



  

(b)  With respect to any action (other than any such
action that is a Remedial Action) to correct a violation of or
a noncompliance with any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit that is
required to satisfy the Seller's indemnification obligations under _Section
9.03(e)_ for any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities (including any Non-
Operating Asset Liabilities that constitute Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities) or under _Section 9.03(f)_ for the matters described in items 1,

(i)  the Purchaser shall control the conduct of such
corrective action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall
reasonably consult with the Seller in all material respects in connection with
undertaking the corrective action, shall provide the Seller with copies of

(ii)  the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any
Purchaser Indemnified Party for capital costs incurred in connection with the
implementation of a corrective action that are in excess of the amount
reasonably required to achieve compliance with any applicable Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit in effect as of the Closing Date, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the Seller shall under no
circumstances be responsible for any corrective action that is required or
recommended pursuant to any internal standards, policies or guidelines of the
Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to the extent
that such corrective action is not required to achieve compliance with any
such Environmental Law or Environmental Permit;

  



  

(iii)  the Seller shall under no circumstances be responsible for
any operating costs related to compliance with any Environmental Law or
Environmental Permit after the Closing, including any operating costs related
to any capital upgrade made as, or in connection with any, such corrective
action; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 9.08(b)(iii)_ shall not be
deemed to limit or condition the Seller's obligations under _Section
9.08(a)(v)_ ;

  



  

(iv)  the Seller shall under no circumstances be responsible for
any removal, abatement, encapsulation, or maintenance of any asbestos
included in any building material or equipment that (A) is not in a condition
that requires such removal, abatement or encapsulation pursuant to
Environmental Law as of the Closing, and (B) is encountered or disturbed
pursuant to any post-Closing demolition, renovation or construction; and

  



  

(v)  for the sake of clarity, the Parties acknowledge that this
_Section 9.08(b)_ does not in any way limit, condition or otherwise affect
the Seller's right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
any Third Party Claim seeking fines or penalties for any pre-Closing
violation of or noncompliance with any Environmental Law or Environmental
Permit.

  



  

(c)  With respect to the Seller's indemnification obligations
under _Section 9.03(e)_ for any Pre-Closing Environmental Liability
(including any Non-Operating Asset Liability that constitutes a Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability) or under _Section 9.03(f)_ for the matters described
in items 1, 4 and 6 of Section 9.03(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller
shall not be responsible for Losses to the extent they are caused, triggered
or increased by (i) any changes in Environmental Law coming into effect after
the Closing Date; (ii) any change in use classification of any Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property after the Closing Date from industrial to
commercial or residential or from commercial to residential;

  



  

   

 | 91|

Environmental Law or by a Governmental Authority; (B) required to be
conducted in response, or reasonably necessary to respond, to a Third Party
Claim (including any such claim alleging that Hazardous Substances have
migrated offsite from any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property); (C)

Closing indicating a material risk to health or the environment; (D)

Real Property that contains substantially similar requirements); (E) conducted
in connection with the bona fide construction, renovation, demolition,
removal, repair, maintenance or expansion of improvements at any Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property, or (F) reasonably necessary for the
performance of any Remedial Action by or on behalf of the Purchaser, any
Purchaser Indemnified Party, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives that is the subject of Seller's indemnification obligations
hereunder.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be liable for (i)
any claim for indemnification for any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
that is made after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any written claim made with reasonable
specificity by the Purchaser prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date shall survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved, or
(ii) any claim for indemnification for any Non-Operating Asset Liabilities
that is made after the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date;

Article X 
  
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  



  

Section 10.01   _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a)  by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before January 20, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ ");
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
10.01(a)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation in any material respect under this Agreement constitutes a
breach hereunder and such breach shall have been the proximate cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date (for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the proviso in _Section 10.01(f))_ , the Purchaser's failure
to close by the Outside Date due to the unavailability of the Debt Financing
shall not in any way limit its termination right pursuant to this _Section
10.01(a)_ , provided that the Purchaser has complied in all material respects
with its obligations under _Section 5.06_ );

  



  

   

 | 92| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  by either the Seller or the Purchaser in the event that any
Governmental Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have become
final and nonappealable;

  



  

(c)  by the Seller if the Purchaser shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 8.01(a)_ , which breach (x) cannot be cured by the Outside Date
or (y) if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, shall not have been
cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and thirty (30) days after the
giving of written notice by the Seller to the Purchaser specifying such
breach;

  



  

(d)  by the Purchaser if the Seller shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 8.02(a)_ , which breach (x) cannot be cured by the Outside Date
or (y) if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, shall not have been
cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and thirty (30) days after the
giving of written notice by the Purchaser to the Seller specifying such
breach; or

  



  

(e)  by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the
Purchaser; or

  



  

(f)  by the Seller, if (i) all of the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties set forth in _Section 8.02_ (other than (A) those
conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the Closing, and (B)
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(c)_ and _Section 8.02(d)_ , but, in
each case of clauses (A) and (B), subject to such conditions being able to be
satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) the Purchaser shall have
failed to consummate the Closing on the date that is three (3) Business Days
following the day the Closing is required to occur under _Section 2.03_ and

_Section 10.01(a)_ shall be deemed to be a termination under this _Section
10.01(f)_ if the Seller was entitled to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 10.01(f)_ at the time of such termination under _Section 10.01(a)_.

  



  

Section 10.02   _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a)  In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided
in _Section 10.01_ , this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and become
void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the
part of either Party except that (a) the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section
5.03_ , this _Section 10.02_ and _Article XI_ shall survive any termination
and (b) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.02(c)_ , nothing
herein shall relieve either Party from liability for any intentional breach
of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

  



  

(b)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.01(f)_ , then the Purchaser shall pay the Seller an aggregate

being understood that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee, if due pursuant to this _Section 10.02(b)_ , shall
be made by wire transfer of same day funds promptly (but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days) after the date on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_  to the account designated by the
Seller.

  



  

   

 | 93| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, if the Purchaser breaches this Agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise, including
with respect to any allegation of fraud) or fails to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise, including
with respect to any allegation of fraud), then, except for the right to seek
specific performance in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of  _Section 11.13_ , the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Purchaser, any
Non-Recourse Party (as defined in the Limited Guarantee) or any Debt Financing
Source for any breach, loss, damage or failure to perform suffered or
incurred under, this Agreement or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith shall be for
the Seller to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_
 (including by any deemed termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_ ) and
receive the Reverse Termination Fee or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.01(a)_ or _Section 10.01(c)_ and seek to recover monetary
damages from the Purchaser, and none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have
any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis
for such termination; _provided_ that in no event shall the Purchaser be
subject to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee in the aggregate; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one (1) occasion. In addition, without modifying or qualifying in any
way the preceding sentence or implying any intent contrary thereto, the
Seller, the Acquired Companies and each of their Affiliates and
Representatives hereby agree that in no event shall the Seller, any Acquired
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives seek or
obtain any damages of any kind against any Debt Financing Source (including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages), in each case, relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
although the Seller may pursue both a grant of specific performance pursuant
to  _Section 11.13_ and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall the Seller, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive: (i) both (A) a grant of specific performance pursuant to
_Section 11.13_ to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment) or the Closing to occur or other
equitable relief, on the one hand, and (B) payment of any monetary damages
whatsoever and/or the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and the
Enforcement Expenses, on the other hand; or (ii) both (A) payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and (B) payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, on the other hand.

  



  

(d)  The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section 10.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to pay
promptly any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 10.02_ , and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Purchaser for the amounts set forth in this _Section 10.02_ , the
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, up to
$1,500,000 in the aggregate (the " _Enforcement Expenses_ ").

  



  

   

 | 94| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) the Purchaser and
the Seller have expressly negotiated the provisions of this _Section 10.02_ ,
(ii) in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of
this Agreement (including the inability of the Parties to quantify the
damages that may be suffered by the Seller) the provisions of this
_Section 10.02_ are reasonable, (iii) the Reverse Termination Fee represents
a good faith, fair estimate of the damages that the Seller would suffer as a
result of the valid termination of this Agreement and the failure to
consummate the Closing, and (iv) in the circumstances in which it is payable,
the Reverse Termination Fee shall be payable as liquidated damages (and not as
a penalty) in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller, in the
circumstances in which it is payable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision, without requiring the Seller or any other Person to
prove actual damages.

Section 11.04   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or

Section 11.11   _Governing Law_.

  



  

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable
principles of conflict of laws that would cause the Laws of another State to
otherwise govern this Agreement. Any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any
Party or any of its Affiliates or against any Party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the Parties hereby (i) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by either Party; (ii)
agrees that service of process will be validly effected by sending notice in
accordance with _Section 10.02_ ; (iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts;
and (iv) agrees not to move to transfer any such Action to a court other than
any of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, each of the Parties agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the Parties agrees
that it will not bring or support any Person in any Action of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal

of New York.

  



  

Section 11.12   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST OR
INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT
FINANCING). EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.12_.

  



  

Section 11.13   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties will be
irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached
and that any nonperformance or breach of this Agreement by any Party could
not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to a valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Article X_ (and, with respect to any provision of this
Agreement that expressly survives any such termination, after any such
termination), in addition to any other right or remedy to which any Party may
be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages, except as
limited by _Section 10.02_ ), such Party shall be entitled to enforce any
provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement without
posting any bond or other undertaking. The Parties agree that they will not
contest the appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein or in any
Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed
that the Seller shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to cause the Purchaser to cause the Acquisition
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with
_Article II_ , only if, (i) the Purchaser is required to complete the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.03_ and the Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.03_ ,
(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Seller has
irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, the Seller is ready, willing and able to proceed with
the Closing in accordance with _Article II_.
