the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(b), all legal and beneficial right,
title and interest in and to all Company Shares free and clear of all Liens,
and, as a result of such acquisitions, Buyer will own all of the issued and
outstanding Company Shares and the Company will be a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Buyer (such transactions being referred to herein, collectively, as the
"Acquisition").

(b) Payment of Base Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent or Buyer shall cause the Paying
Agent to (promptly following the Paying Agent's receipt thereof), deliver to
each holder of a Company Share issued and outstanding as of immediately prior

fully set forth herein, but without duplication) (i) applicable Tax
withholding, including any income or employment tax withholding required under
the Code, the Israel Tax Ordinance or any provision of Tax Law, (ii) the
amounts that Parent or Buyer are entitled to withhold to fund the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and (iii) the amounts that Parent or Buyer are
entitled to withhold to fund the Representative Expense Fund pursuant to
Section 2.4(c):

(i) With respect to each Preferred Share and each Company Ordinary Share,
other than Company Ordinary Shares held by the Cash Out Shareholder and the
Founders, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, the
following:

(A) an amount of cash equal to Fifty Percent (50%) of the Per Share
Consideration payable with respect to such share less such share's Pro Rata
Share of the sum of (i) the principal amount of the Founder Note plus (ii) the
Founder Retained Amount; and



(B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to quotient obtained by
dividing (i) Fifty Percent (50%) of the Per Share Consideration payable with

Share of the sum of (i) the principal amount of the Founder Note plus (ii) the
Founder Retained Amount;

(B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to quotient obtained by
dividing (i) Thirty Five Percent (35%) of the Per Share Consideration payable
with respect to such share by (ii) the Trading Price; and

(C) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to quotient obtained by
dividing (i) Thirty Percent (30%) of the Per Share Consideration payable with

Share Holdback Amount").

(iii) With respect to each Company Ordinary Share that is held by a Cash-Out
Shareholder and that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing, an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Consideration less such
Company Ordinary Share's Pro Rata Share of the sum of (i) the principal amount
of the Founder Note plus (ii) the Founder Retained Amount payable with respect
to such share.

(iv) With respect to each Vested Company Option, the amount set forth in

of cash payable to each Company Shareholder in respect of such shareholder's
Company Shares pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), (i) all of the Company Shares
held by each Company Shareholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-
certificate basis and (ii) the amount of cash payable in respect of each such
certificate shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. No fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Acquisition, but, in
lieu thereof, each Company Shareholder that would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, less the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated by Section
2.4(e) that are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) such fraction by (ii) the Trading Price.



(d) Payment of Adjusted Net Cash Amount.

(i) in the event that the Adjusted Net Cash Amount is a positive amount, then,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent or Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to (promptly following the Paying

outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and to each holder of
Vested Company Options and Vested Promised Options, an amount equal to the Per

Vested Company Option or Vested Promised Option, as the case may be, in each
case, less applicable Tax withholding, including any income or employment tax
withholding required under the Code, the Israel Tax Ordinance or any provision
of Tax Law.

(ii) in the event that the Adjusted Net Cash Amount is a negative amount,
resulting in the Total Consideration being lower than the Base Consideration,
then the cash consideration payable to each holder of a Company Share issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and to each holder of
Vested Company Options and Vested Promised Options as set forth in Section
2.1(b)(i)(A), Section 2.1(b)(ii)(A), Section 2.1(b)(iii) , Section 2.1(b)(iv)
and Section 2.1(b)(v) above shall be decreased, in respect of each such
Company Share, Vested Company Option or Vested Promised Option by an amount
equal to the value of the negative Per Share Net Cash Adjustment
Consideration.

(e) Repayment of Founder Note. If, following the Closing Date, all or any
portion of the Founder Note is repaid to the holder of such Founder Note on or
prior to the maturity date thereof, Parent shall pay, promptly after such
repayment is made, the amount of such Founder Note plus accrued interest so
repaid (net of any Taxes paid or deemed paid by Parent, Buyer or the Company
thereon or in respect thereof, calculated using the highest corporate Tax rate
applicable in the jurisdiction of the holder of the Founder Note), to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the Contributing Securityholders. For purposes
of calculating the amount of cash payable to each Contributing Securityholder
pursuant to this Section 2.1(e), such amount of the Founder Note so repaid
(net of any Taxes paid or deemed paid by Parent, Buyer or the Company thereon
or in respect thereof, calculated using the highest corporate Tax rate
applicable in the jurisdiction of the holder of the Founder Note) shall be
distributed to each Contributing Securityholder in accordance with such
Contributing Securityholder's Pro Rata Share. If any amount of the Founder
Note remains unpaid on the maturity date, Parent shall cause the holder of
such Founder Note to, assign and transfer the Founder Note to the
Representative on behalf of the Contributing Securityholders.

(f) Payment of Founder Retained Amount. If, upon the maturity date of the
Founder Note, any principal amount of the Founder Note remains unpaid, Parent
shall pay an amount from the Founder Retained Amount equal to such unpaid
principal amount of the Founder Note to Netanel Davidi or to another Person
designated in writing by the Representative on behalf of the Contributing
Securityholders to be held on behalf of all of the Contributing
Securityholders as compensation, net of all applicable employer Taxes and
employee withholding Taxes. To the extent the principal amount of the Founder
Note has been repaid upon the maturity date of the Founder Note, Parent shall
pay an amount from the Founder Retained Amount equal to such repaid principal
amount of the Founder Note (without interest thereon) to the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the Contributing Securityholders. For purposes of calculating
the amount of cash payable to each Contributing Securityholder pursuant to the
second sentence of this Section 2.1(f), such amount of the Founder Retained
Amount shall be distributed to each Contributing Securityholder in accordance
with each such Contributing Securityholder's Pro Rata Share. To the extent
that the consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any Person under
Section 2.1(e) or this Section 2.1(f) is not reduced by such deductions or
withholdings, such Person shall indemnify Parent and its affiliates (including
the Company) for any Taxes imposed by any Taxing Authority.

Paying Agent) an amount of cash equal to the Per Option Consideration, less
(w) such Vested Company Option's Pro Rata Share of the sum of (1) the
principal amount of the Founder Note plus (2) the Founder Retained Amount, (x)
applicable Tax withholding, including any income or employment tax withholding
required under the Code, the Israel Tax Ordinance or any provision of Tax Law,
(y) the amounts that Buyer is entitled to withhold to fund the Escrow Amount
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and (z) the amounts that Buyer is entitled to
withhold to fund the Representative Expense Fund pursuant to Section 2.4(c).
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of such Vested Company Option.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.2 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall deliver the Total Consideration
payable in respect of any Company 102 Shares, Company 3(i) Options and Company

released in accordance with the agreement with the 102 Trustee, applicable Law
(including the provisions of Section 102 of the Israel Tax Ordinance and the
regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, including the completion of any
required 102 Trust Period) and the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling (or any other
approval from the Israel Tax Authority received either by the Company or
Buyer). The 102 Trustee shall be required to withhold any amounts required in
accordance with applicable Law (including the provisions of Section 102 of the
Israel Tax Ordinance and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder,
including the completion of any required 102 Trust Period) and the Israeli 102
Tax Ruling (or any other approval from the Israel Tax Authority received

any consideration as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(c) Vested Promised Options. At the Closing, the holder of each Vested
Promised Option shall, by virtue of the Acquisition, be entitled to receive
from Buyer (acting through the Company or the Paying Agent) an amount of cash
equal to the Per Option Consideration, less (w) such Vested Promised Option's
Pro Rata Share of the sum of (1) the principal amount of the Founder Note plus
(2) the Founder Retained Amount, (x) applicable Tax withholding, including any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code, the Israel Tax
Ordinance or any provision of Tax Law, (y) the amounts that Buyer is entitled
to withhold to fund the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and (z) the
amounts that Buyer is entitled to withhold to fund the Representative Expense
Fund pursuant to Section 2.4(c). To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Vested Promised Option.

(d) Necessary Actions. Prior to the Closing, and subject to the prior review
and approval of Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect
the transactions anticipated by this Section 2.2 under the Company Stock
Plans, all agreements evidencing Company Options and any other plan or
arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal),
including delivering all required notices and obtaining any required consents,
such that at the Closing the Company shall not have any



outstanding equity interests other than Company Shares and Company Options
outstanding as set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet.

2.3 Additional Parties.

(a) Execution of Agreement by Additional Parties. To the extent applicable,
promptly after the date of execution of this Agreement and for as long as this

as an Executing Shareholder. The Company agrees to communicate promptly to
Parent any update to the Company's efforts to obtain a counter signature on

(b) Bring-Along. By executing this Agreement, the Executing Shareholders, who
collectively hold more than 90% (which exceeds the threshold of 75% required

(i) an offer by Buyer and/or Parent for the purchase of all issued and

Company that is a Non-Executing Shareholder, setting forth the information
required by the Articles of Association and offering such Non-Executing
Shareholder to sell all Company Shares owned by it to Buyer pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and become an Executing Shareholder
under this Agreement. Buyer and the Company shall fully coordinate any
correspondence which concerns the Bring-Along Notice and any such
correspondence including the Bring-Along Notice shall be subject to the prior
written reasonable approval of Buyer. Buyer and the Company shall take such
other actions appropriate in order to complete the transfer of all Company
Shares in accordance with the Articles of Association and Section 341 of the
Companies Law and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the making of all filings and taking such other actions which are
necessary or desirable to effectuate the Acquisition with respect to all of

the Articles of Association and the Companies Law. The Company shall register
the transfer of all of the Company Shares held by all of its Non-Executing
Shareholders in the Company\'s Register of Shareholders, to Buyer, and all
share certificates held by Non-Executing Shareholders shall be deemed
cancelled without any further action by any party pursuant to Article 24 of
the Articles of Association,

deposited at the Closing with the Paying Agent, as trustee (the "Trust
Consideration"), in accordance with Article 24 of the Articles of Association,
and shall be allocated by the Company among the Non-Executing Shareholders in

Executing Shareholder shall be entitled to receive its respective portion of
the Total Consideration, if any, and the Paying Agent shall release such
portion of the Total Consideration to such Non-Executing Shareholders only
upon and subject to such Non-Executing Shareholder\'s delivering all relevant
documents under Section 3.2 and any other document executed by the Executing
Shareholders, including without limitation a counterpart signature page to
this Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts in order to (i) obtain
execution of a counterpart signature page to this Agreement for the
satisfaction and completion of the necessary procedures under Section 341 of
the Companies Law and Article 24 of the Articles of Association, and (ii)

Agreement.

2.4 Payment Procedures.

(a) Closing Payment Fund. At the Closing or within one Business Day thereafter
(such applicable date, the "Funding Time"), Parent shall deposit, or cause to

cash equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, less (but without duplication)
(A) the Escrow Cash Amount and (B) the Representative Expense Amount, and (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Aggregate Stock
Consideration, less (but without duplication) the Escrow Stock Amount (such
deposited funds being referred to herein as the "Closing Payment Fund"). All
cash funds held from time to time in the Closing Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Buyer pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the terms
hereof; provided, however, that no gain or loss thereon or income or loss
generated thereby shall affect the amounts payable by Parent and Buyer to
Company Securityholders pursuant to this Article 2. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in
the Closing Payment Fund and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
Company Securityholders shall be payable to Parent or Buyer. All interest and
other earnings from any investment of funds held from time to time in the
Closing Payment Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Buyer, and no
part of such interest or other earnings shall accrue to or for the benefit of
any Company Securityholders. Promptly following the Closing, each Company
Securityholder shall be entitled to receive (i) from the Paying Agent, by
delivery of a check or by such other payment mechanism approved by the
applicable Company Securityholder in its reasonable discretion, the cash
constituting the portion of the Closing Payment Fund to which such Company
Securityholder is entitled at Closing pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2,
less any applicable Tax withholding, and (ii) subject to Section 2.4(d), the
number of shares constituting the portion of the Closing Payment Fund to which
such Company Securityholder is entitled at Closing pursuant to Section 2.1,
less any applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may
deliver the Aggregate Stock Consideration in a book-entry or similar position
through The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation or any other depository or
similar functionary, credited to an account for the benefit of the applicable
Company Shareholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Section 2.4(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent or Buyer shall
cause the Paying Agent or the Company, as the case may be, to deliver any
consideration described in this Section 2.4(a) with respect to Company 102
Securities and Company 3(i) Options to the 102 Trustee to be held and released
in accordance with the agreement with



the 102 Trustee, applicable Law (including the provisions of Section 102 of
the Israel Tax Ordinance and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder,
including, where applicable, the completion of any required 102 Trust Period)
and the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling (or any other approval from the Israel Tax
Authority received either by the Company or Buyer, including the Interim
Options Tax Ruling). The 102 Trustee shall be required to withhold any amounts
required in accordance with the applicable Law (including, without limitation,
the provisions of Section 102 of the Israel Tax Ordinance and the regulations
and rules promulgated thereunder, including the completion of any required 102
Trust Period) and the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling (or any other approval from the
Israel Tax Authority received by either the Company or Buyer, including the
Interim Options Tax Ruling).

(b) Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to withhold (but without
duplication) from the aggregate portion of the Total Consideration otherwise
payable to Contributing Securityholders in the Acquisition pursuant to Section
2.1 and Section 2.2, such Contributing Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Amount, as follows: (i) in the case of each Company Shareholder other
than the Founders, 50% in shares of Parent Common Stock (having a value based
on the Trading Price) and payable 50% in cash, (ii) with respect to each
Founder, entirely in shares of Parent Common Stock (having a value based on
the Trading Price) subject to a Holdback Agreement with such Founder, and
(iii) with respect to each Vested Company Optionholder and Vested Promised
Optionholder, payable entirely in cash. The Escrow Amount is to be held by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (other than
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to a Holdback Agreement described in
clause (ii) above). At the Funding Time, Parent or Buyer shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent (i) an amount in cash equal to
the Escrow Cash Amount and (ii) an amount in Parent Common Stock equal to the
Escrow Stock Amount. The Escrow Amount shall be held and distributed in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
in the case of the Founders, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and each
such Founder's Holdback Agreement.

(c) Representative Expense Fund.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to withhold (but without duplication) from
the aggregate Total Consideration otherwise payable to the Contributing
Securityholders in the Acquisition pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 an
amount of cash equal to the Representative Expense Amount. The Representative
Expense Amount shall be withheld from each Contributing Securityholder based
on such Contributing Securityholder's Pro Rata Share, and each Contributing
Securityholder shall be deemed to have contributed to the Representative
Expense Fund such holder's Pro Rata Share of the Representative Expense
Amount, to be held by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement. As soon
as practicable following the Closing, Parent or Buyer shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Representative an amount in cash equal to the
Representative Expense Amount (such funds being referred to herein as the
"Representative Expense Fund"). The Representative shall hold the
Representative Expense Fund as partial security for the reimbursement
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties to the Representative under this
Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. The
Representative Expense Fund (or any portion thereof) shall be distributed to
the Representative or the Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(d) esentative Expense FuStock Holdback. At the Closing, Parent shall issue
the aggregate Founder Per Share Holdback Amount to which each Founder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii)(C). Such shares shall be issued in the
name of Holdback Trustee for the benefit of the Founder (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be issued in a book-entry or similar position through
The Depository Trust



and Clearing Corporation or any other depository or similar functionary,
credited to an account for the benefit of such Founder) and shall be deposited
with the Holdback Trustee who shall also serve as 104 Trustee to the extent
104H Ruling shall be obtained and delivered to the Parent in accordance with
Section 8.5(d) below, and shall be subject to the terms and restrictions of
such Founder's Holdback Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including with
respect to their release and/or forfeiture. The aggregate Founder Per Share
Holdback Amount shall include the Founder Holdback Indemnity Portion, which
shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund, as partial security against the
indemnification obligations of the Founders under this Agreement. No fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Acquisition,
but, in lieu thereof, each Founder who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such Founder
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii)(C)) shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding
Taxes as contemplated by Section 2.4(f) which are required to be withheld with
respect thereto, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such
fraction by (ii) the Trading Price.

(e) Shares of Parent Common Stock. In addition to any legends that may
otherwise be required by the terms and conditions of the Shareholders
Agreement, the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued
by Parent to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.1 shall bear the
following legend:

THE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER
SAID ACT. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS.

(f) Withholding Rights.

(i) Parent, Buyer, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the 102 Trustee
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (but without duplication) from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts Buyer, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the 102
Trustee, as the case may be, determines are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Law in respect of Taxes, the Israeli Tax Ordinance, or under any
other applicable Law, and to request and be provided any necessary and validly
executed Tax forms, including valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the
appropriate version of Form W-8, as applicable, and any similar information at
the maximum rate for such withholding. The aforesaid includes an entitlement
to withhold taxes from any consideration payable to any Person with respect to
the share of such Person in the Escrow Amount; in the event that Buyer or the
Paying Agent is required to withhold taxes with respect to the Escrow Amount
from any consideration Buyer or the Paying Agent makes to any Contributing
Securityholder (unless the Israel Tax Authority approves, to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and/or Buyer that the payment by Buyer to the Escrow
Agent will not be subject to Israeli withholding tax), then such withholding
will instead be deducted from the consideration that is otherwise payable to
the relevant Contributing Securityholder at Closing in order to ensure that
the funds actually being transferred to the



Escrow Fund shall equal the Escrow Amount. Furthermore, in the event that
Buyer or the Paying Agent is required to withhold taxes with respect to the
Representative Expense Fund from any consideration Buyer or Paying Agent makes
to any Contributing Securityholder, other than the Founders (unless the Israel
Tax Authority approves, to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and/or Buyer
that the payment by Buyer to the Representative will not be subject to Israeli
withholding tax), then such withholding will instead be deducted from the
consideration that is paid to the relevant Contributing Securityholder at
Closing, in order to ensure that the funds actually being transferred to the
Representative Expense Fund shall equal the Representative Expense Amount. To
the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(f)(i) above, with respect
to Israeli Tax, the Total Consideration payable to each of the Company
Securityholders hereunder (excluding amounts held in the Escrow Fund under
Section 2.4(b)), shall be paid to and retained by the Paying Agent for the
benefit of each such Company Securityholder for a period of 180 days from
Closing or an earlier date required in writing by a Company Securityholder
(the "Withholding Drop Date") (during which time neither Buyer nor the Paying
Agent shall withhold any Israeli Tax on such consideration, except as provided
below), and during which time each Company Securityholder may obtain a
certification or ruling (the "Qualified Withholding Certificate") issued by
the Israel Tax Authority, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, (x) exempting Buyer from the duty to withhold Israeli Taxes with
respect to such Company Securityholder, (y) determining the applicable rate of
Israeli Tax to be withheld from such Company Securityholder or (z) providing
any other instructions regarding the payment or withholding with respect to
the applicable consideration of such Company Securityholder. In the event that
no later than five (5) Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date, a
Company Securityholder submits a Qualified Withholding Certificate, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, the Paying Agent shall withhold

Authority, and (2) to the extent that any such certificate, ruling or
confirmation is not timely provided by such Company Securityholder to Buyer,
to Parent, or the



Paying Agent, transfer to the Israel Tax Authority any amount so demanded, and
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been delivered and paid to such Company Securityholder.

not be applicable to Buyer, the Company, or any such Subsidiary of the

Intellectual Property.

execute a proprietary information, confidentiality and invention assignment
Contract in the form(s) made available to Parent and/or Buyer (each a

employers) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no other claims
alleging ownership of any Company Intellectual Property. All amounts payable
by the Company or its Subsidiaries to all Persons involved in the research,
development, conception or reduction to practice of any of the Company's or
any Subsidiary's Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights have

invention, modification or improvement of any Company Intellectual Property,
in whole or in part, have explicitly waived any and all Moral Rights with
respect to the Company Intellectual Property. No current or former Employee or
current or former Contractor of the Company or any or its Subsidiaries has any

Contractor of the Company or any or its Subsidiaries: (i) has been or is in
material violation of applicable Law or any term or covenant of any employment
contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention assignment agreement,
nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or any other Contract with

by, or performing services for, the Company or any or its Subsidiaries or
using Confidential Information of others without permission; or (ii) has
developed any Intellectual Property for the Company while they were working
for the Company or any or its Subsidiaries that is subject to any contract

development of any Company Intellectual Property has performed services for
the government, for the government-owned institution or branch, including
without limitation the Israeli Defense Force, for a university, college or

other than as required by COBRA or applicable state Law.

alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee or officer of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance
pay, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) increase or otherwise
enhance any benefits otherwise payable by the



Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) accelerate the time of payment or

and each Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement that has been adopted,
contributed to, required to be contributed to, or maintained by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, whether formally or
informally, or with respect to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate shall or may have any liability, for the benefit of
Employees and/or former Employees who perform services outside the United
States (each such plan, including the Israeli Benefit Plan, a "Foreign Plan")
is listed in Section 4.15(i) of the Disclosure Schedule. With respect to each
Foreign Plan, (i) such Foreign Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with the provisions of the Law of each jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan

Plan, (ii) all contributions to, and payments from, such Foreign Plan, which
may have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such Foreign
Plan (except those who are in the normal operation of such Foreign Plan), and,

maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and

Foreign Plan, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet,
but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on the
Balance Sheet, (iii) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA

give effect to such Foreign Plan, (iv) such Foreign Plan has been administered
in all material respects at all times in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law, (v) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending
investigations by any governmental body involving such Foreign Plan, and no
pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal operation
of such Foreign Plan), suits or proceedings against such Foreign Plan or
asserting any rights or claims to benefits under such Foreign Plan, (vi) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by

Foreign Plan, and (vii) except as required by applicable Law, no condition
exists that would prevent the Company from terminating or amending any Foreign
Plan at any time for any reason in accordance with the terms of each such
Foreign Plan without the payment of any fees, costs or expenses (other than
the payment of benefits accrued on the Balance Sheet and any normal and
reasonable expenses typically incurred in a termination event). The benefits
available under all Foreign Plans in the aggregate do not provide materially
greater benefits to employees of the Company participating in such plans than
the benefits available under the Plans for employees of the Company in the
U.S. No Foreign Plan has unfunded Liabilities that will not be offset by
insurance or that are not fully accrued on the financial statements of the
Company. Each Plan under Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Ordinance has been

for a ruling that provides, in effect, inter alia, (A) that the treatment of
Company 102 Options that are Vested Company Options as contemplated by Section
2.2 and the delivery to the 102 Trustee, with respect to Company 102
Securities held by the 102 Trustee, of consideration as described in Section
2.2, in each case prior to the lapse of the 102 Trust Period, will not be
treated as a breach of the provisions of Section 102 of the Israel Tax
Ordinance, provided that the applicable consideration paid to holders of
Company 102 Securities is deposited for at least the duration of the 102 Trust
Period with the 102 Trustee and that such consideration shall be considered
under Section 102 of the Israel Tax Ordinance to be income subject to the
"capital gains route"; (B) Buyer and anyone acting on its behalf, including
the Paying Agent, shall be exempt from withholding Tax in relation to any
payments or consideration transferred to the 102 Trustee in relation to
Company 102 Securities; (C) that the Escrow Fund distributions in respect of
Company 102 Securities and Company 3(i) Options shall not be subject to Israel
Tax until actually received by the applicable Securityholder; and (D) that the
Total Consideration paid by Parent or Buyer to the Paying Agent, the Escrow
Agent and the 102 Trustee shall not be subject to Israel Tax withholding (the
"Israeli 102 Tax Ruling"). The Company shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts
to have each Israeli holder of Company Options (whether Vested Company Options
or Unvested Company Options, which are subject to the provisions of Section
8.21(b)) execute and deliver to the Company (A) their acknowledgement of
receipt of copies of all securities filings under the Israel Securities
Authorities Exemption; (B) their agreement to the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling; and
(C) their acknowledgement of being informed of the risks involved in shares of
a publicly traded company, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent. If the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the Closing,
the Company shall seek to receive prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling
confirming, among others things, that Parent and Buyer and anyone acting on
their behalves (including the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent) shall be
exempt from Israeli withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with
respect to Company 102 Securities and Company 3(i) Options by the 102 Trustee
or the Company (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions regularly
associated with such a ruling) (the "Interim Options Tax Ruling"). To the
extent the Interim Options Tax Ruling is obtained, all references herein to
the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such interim ruling,
until such time that a final definitive Israeli 102 Tax Ruling is obtained.
The parties will cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and
accountants to coordinate and cooperate and provide all information required
with respect to the Company's preparation and filing of such application and
in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling or the Interim
Options Tax Ruling, as applicable. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Company shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the Interim Options Tax Ruling



and the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling as promptly as practicable; provided, however,
that if none of such rulings is obtained for any reason whatsoever by the
Closing Date, the Closing shall not be delayed or postponed. For the avoidance
of doubt, the language in and provisions of the Israeli 102 Tax Ruling and, if
applicable, the Interim Options Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Parent and Buyer or their counsel, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. Should Parent's and Buyer's
counsel not attend any meeting or discussion with the Israel Tax Authority,

an update of such meeting or discussion within two (2) Business Days of such
meeting or discussion.

action under this Section 8.9 or any other provision of this Agreement if any

Taxes for which Buyer will seek indemnification pursuant to Article 10, then
such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable
Law and in a manner consistent with prior practice (unless otherwise required
by applicable Law as determined in the reasonable discretion of Parent) and
not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Pre-Closing Tax Return (or, if such due date is within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date), Buyer shall provide the Representative with a copy of any such Tax
Return that reflects only operations and Taxes relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or a pro forma Tax Return reflecting only such operations
and Taxes. Buyer shall consider in good faith any written comments provided by

Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which an indemnification claim could be
made pursuant to Article 10, Parent, Buyer and the Company, on the one hand,
and the Representative and the Company Securityholders, on the other hand,
shall cooperate fully with each other, including by furnishing or making

examinations or the defense of claims relating to such Taxes.

(e) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Anything in any other agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall
take all action necessary to cease and terminate any Tax allocation, sharing
or indemnity agreement or arrangement (other than between the Company and any
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) effective at the Closing, and all
obligations thereunder shall terminate and no additional payments shall be
made thereunder after the Closing, except with respect to any claims in effect
as of such termination.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer or its

honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any
indemnification provisions under applicable Law, the Articles of Association
as in effect on the date hereof or pursuant to the indemnification agreements
listed in Schedule 8.25 attached hereto (the "Indemnification Schedule"),
insofar as such indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation for
acts or omissions provisions relate to the directors and officers of the
Company set forth in the Indemnification Schedule (such directors and officers
being herein called the "Company Indemnitees"), regardless of whether any
proceeding relating to any Company Indemnitee's rights to indemnification or
advancement of expenses or to any such acts or omissions is commenced before
or after the Closing. The rights of each Company Indemnitee shall be
enforceable by each such Company Indemnitee or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns. If any claim is made against or
involves any Company Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing, the provisions of this Section 8.25 shall continue in effect with
respect to such claim until the final disposition thereof. The obligations of
Parent, Buyer, the Company (following the Acquisition) or its successors under
this Section 8.25 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee (or his or her
heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior
written consent of such Company Indemnitee (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns, as applicable). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations of the Parent, Buyer and the Company (following the
Acquisition) (i) shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law
and (ii) shall not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee who is also an
officer or director of the Company from his or her obligations pursuant to
this Agreement or any Related Agreement, nor shall such Company Indemnitee
have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from
Buyer or its successor or Parent with respect to any particular amount of Loss
recoverable by any of the Indemnified Parties against such Company Indemnitee
in his or her capacity as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement or
any Related Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Buyer shall
have no obligation to maintain the existence of the Company for any specified
period following the Closing.

(b) The Company shall purchase, prior to or concurrent with the Closing, a
prepaid directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or policies (i.e.,
"tail coverage") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing that
will remain in effect for a period of six years after the Closing, the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are comparable to
those of the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy (copies of which have been delivered by the Company to Parent and its
representatives prior to the date hereof). Parent shall cooperate in good
faith with the Company Indemnitees to use the tail coverage with respect to
claims relating to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing.

8.26 Termination or Waiver of Company Shareholders Rights. Each Executing
Shareholder, by execution of this Agreement, hereby, on behalf of himself,
herself or itself, and on behalf of each other Company Shareholder (a) waives,

contingent upon the Closing, any rights of first refusal, rights to any
liquidation preference, redemption rights and rights of notice, including but
not limited to those set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, the
Amended and Restated Purchasers Rights Agreement, dated June 11, 2013, as
amended on July 31, 2013, by and among the Company, the Founders, holders of

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent, Buyer and the Company;

(b) by Parent, Buyer or the Company, if the Closing Date shall not have
occurred by May 21, 2014; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party who is

obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or a Company
Securityholder contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement such that

Company Shareholder of a signature page to this Agreement whereupon such
Company Shareholder shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed to be a

to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in

Indemnifying Parties agree that any extension or waiver signed by the
Representative shall be binding upon and effective against all Indemnifying
Parties whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver. No delay or
failure by any party to assert any of its rights or remedies shall constitute
a waiver of such rights or remedies.

ARTICLE 10

POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Contributing
Securityholders contained in this Agreement or the Closing Certificates shall
survive until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date
(the date of expiration of such twenty-four (24)-month period, the "Survival
Date"); provided, however, that, in the event of the fraudulent or willful
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or the Certificates, such representation or warranty shall survive
without limitation; provided further, however, that (i) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.12 (Intellectual
Property) and in Section 4.7 (Financial Statements) shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in full force and effect until



the thirty-six (36)-month anniversary of the Closing, (ii) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.10 (Taxes) shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until 90 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations in respect of Taxes
addressed by any such representation and warranty and (iii) the
representations and warranties (x) of the Contributing Securityholders in this
Agreement and (y) of the Company set forth in (A) Section 4.1 (Organization
and Good Standing), (B) Section 4.2 (Authority and Enforceability), (C)
Section 4.4 (No Conflicts) and (D) Section 4.5 (Capitalization) shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity and
without limitation (the survival period of each such representation and
warranty, as applicable, being referred to herein as the "Survival Period"),
regardless of any investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of
the parties hereto (such representations and warranties of the Contributing
Securityholders and of the Company set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5,
4.7 and 4.10 being referred to hereinafter as the "Surviving
Representations"). The representations and warranties of Parent and Buyer
contained in this Agreement, the Related Agreements or in any certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the
Closing. In the event that an Officer's Certificate asserting a breach of a
representation or warranty is delivered before the date on which such
representation or warranty ceases to survive (in the case of the
representations and warranties that survive until the Survival Date, which
survival period is not being extended beyond the Survival Date by this
parenthetical, such delivery may be made before 5:00 p.m., local time, at
Parent's corporate headquarters in California on the date that is five (5)
Business Days after the Survival Date (the "Escrow Release Date")), then the
claims arising in connection with such Officer's Certificate shall survive for
the benefit of all Indemnified Parties beyond the expiration of the applicable
survival period for such representation or warranty, until such claim is
settled or otherwise determined in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 10.

(b) All of the covenants or other agreements of the parties hereto contained
in this Agreement shall survive until fully performed or fulfilled, unless and
to the extent only that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is
waived in writing by the party entitled to such performance. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the Indemnified Parties (as defined below) shall not be
entitled to indemnification with respect to any breach by the Company
following the Closing, and (ii) except in the case of willful breach, the
Indemnified Parties may not make any claim for breach of a covenant that by
its nature is required to be performed by or prior to the expiration of the
Survival Period after the Escrow Release Date; provided, however, that in the
event that an Officer's Certificate asserting breach of any such covenant is
delivered before the Escrow Release Date, then the claims arising in
connection with such Officer's Certificate shall survive for the benefit of
all Indemnified Parties beyond the expiration of the Escrow Release Date with
respect to such covenant, until such claim is settled or otherwise resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Article 10.

10.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 10, from and after the
consummation of the Acquisition, each of the Contributing Securityholders
(each, an "Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties")
agrees to, severally (based on such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of
each Loss covered by this Section 10.2(a)) and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, Buyer each of their Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), their respective affiliates and
the respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of
Parent, Buyer each of their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing,

(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), against, without duplication, all
claims, actions, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties and expenses, including reasonable attorneys',
and expenses and including any such reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of third party consultants retained for such
purpose) incurred in connection



with investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing and any
Taxes incurred as a result of the foregoing, but excluding any of the
foregoing arising solely from (i) (a) special circumstances of Parent or Buyer
that the Company could not foresee or (b) special circumstances of Parent or
Buyer of which the Company has no Knowledge or (ii) Parent or Buyer's failure
to mitigate any of the foregoing as required by applicable Law (hereinafter
individually a "Loss" and collectively, "Losses"), incurred or sustained by
the Indemnified Parties or any of them (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing), resulting from, or arising out of any of
the following (the "Indemnifiable Matters"):

(i) any failure of a representation or warranty of the Company or any Company
Securityholder contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or in the
Certificates to be true and correct in all respects in accordance with their
terms;

(ii) subject to Section 10.1(b), any failure by the Company or any Company

absolute value of the Closing Adjusted Net Cash Amount and (B) the amount by
which the Closing Adjusted Net Cash Amount is less than the Adjusted Net Cash
Amount set forth in the Adjusted Net Cash Amount Certificate;

(iv) any Transaction Expenses of the Company not repaid prior to or
concurrently with the Closing (other than Transaction Expenses to the extent
taken into account in the calculation of the Adjusted Net Cash Amount);

of the Adjusted Net Cash Amount);

the Adjusted Net Cash Amount that are not received by Parent within the ninety
(90) day period commencing on the Closing Date;

(vii) any claims or threatened claims by or purportedly on behalf of any
holder or former holder of any shares of Company Securities or rights or
purported rights to acquire Company Securities or other equity interests in
the Company (or the economic value thereof), or in connection with the
Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
(1) claims arising under Contracts to which any such holder in its capacity as
such is a party or by which it is bound, or (2) claims alleging violations of
fiduciary duty;

(viii) any inaccuracy or omission in the Payment Spreadsheet, including any
amounts set forth therein that are paid to a Person in excess of the amounts
that such Person is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or any amounts that a Person was entitled to receive pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement that were omitted from the Payment Spreadsheet;

(ix) any claim or threatened claim by any actual or purported Contributing
Securityholder relating to any alleged action or failure to act on its behalf
by the Representative or asserting



any right to receive such Contributing Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Amount on an accelerated basis rather than in accordance with the terms
of this Article 10 or the Escrow Agreement;

(x) any Liabilities relating to or arising out of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

(xi) any fraud by the Company or Company Securityholders in connection with,
or any willful breach of, this Agreement or the Certificates;

(xii) any payment or consideration arising under any consents, notices,
waivers, terminations, modifications or approvals of any party under any
Contract as are required in connection with the Acquisition or for any such
Contract to remain in full force or effect following the Closing;

(xiii) any unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes, except to the extent included as
Liabilities on the Adjusted Net Cash Amount Certificate;

(b) Notwithstanding Section 10.1(b), Section 10.2(a), Section 10.3(a) or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of any Person who commits fraud or willfully
breaches, or has actual knowledge of any fraud or willful breach of the
Company in connection with, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Certificates or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any
Losses incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties or any of them
(including the Company) as a result of any such fraud or such willful breach;
(ii) none of the Indemnified Parties' legal claims arising out of any such
fraud or willful breach shall be limited or waived by this Article 10 or this
Agreement with respect to any Person committing such fraud or such willful
breach or having actual knowledge of the Company's fraud or willful breach;
and (iii) none of the Indemnified Parties' equitable claims arising out of any
fraud or any willful breach shall be limited or waived by this Article 10 or
this Agreement.

(c) For the purpose of this Article 10 only, solely when determining the
amount of Losses suffered (but not whether a breach, inaccuracy or failure has
occurred) by an Indemnified Party as a result of any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of the Company or any failure by the Company or any
Indemnifying Party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement
applicable to it that is qualified or limited in scope as to materiality,
dollar amount (in the case of Material Contracts), Company Material Adverse
Effect or Knowledge, such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall be deemed to be made without such qualification or limitation.

(d) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,

Surviving Representations, or any fraud in connection with, or any willful
breach of, any representation or warranty of the Company or Company
Shareholders contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the

Parties that may be claimed thereunder (together with any Losses that may be
claimed under any other subsection of Section 10.2(a)) exceeds $100,000 (the
"Threshold"), and once such Threshold has been reached, the Indemnifying
Parties shall be liable to the Indemnified Parties for the full amount of all
Losses, including those that comprised any portion of the Threshold.

(b) Subject to Section 10.2(b), the maximum aggregate amount that the
Indemnified Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Party for Losses in

any breach or inaccuracy of the Surviving Representations, to such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the Total Consideration received by the

(iii) with respect to such Indemnifiable Matters to the extent they arise from
any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company

(inclusive of any amounts paid with respect to any Losses claimed under
Section 10.2(a)(i)), on a Pro Rata Basis among all Contributing
Securityholders.

(c) Subject to Section 10.2(b), the maximum aggregate amount that the
Indemnified Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Party for Losses in
respect of the Indemnifiable Matters described in Section
10.2(a)(vii)-10.2(a)(ix), Section 10.2(a)(xi), Section 10.2(a)(xiii) and

to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Parties hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement, or the Certificate.

(f) If an Indemnified Party's claim under this Article 10 may be brought under
different sections of Section 10.2(a), then such Indemnified Party shall have
the right to bring such claim under any applicable section it chooses in
accordance with this Article 10, provided, however, that no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover from an Indemnifying Party more than once.

or their respective affiliates.

10.4 Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts

(a) Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer's Certificate. An Indemnified
Party may seek recovery of Losses pursuant to this Article 10 by delivering to
the Representative an Officer's Certificate in respect of such claim. The date
of such delivery of an Officer's Certificate is referred to herein as the
"Claim Date" of such Officer's Certificate (and the claims for indemnification
contained therein). For purposes hereof, "Officer's Certificate" shall mean a
certificate signed by any officer of an Indemnified Party (or, in the case of
an Indemnified Party who is an individual, signed by such individual): (i)
stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or accrued,
or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue
Losses and including, to the extent reasonably practicable, a non-binding,
preliminary estimate of the amounts of such Losses; and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail, to the extent known, the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained,
incurred, or accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to which such item is related and a good
faith non-binding, preliminary estimate of the amount which such Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled to receive hereunder, which shall be the amount of
Losses such Indemnified Party claims to have so incurred or suffered;
provided, however, that the Officer's Certificate (A) need only specify such
information to the knowledge of such officer or such Indemnified Party as of
the Claim Date, and (B) may be updated and amended from time to time by the
Indemnified Party, if the Indemnifying Party becomes aware of any new facts,
which are relevant to the applicable indemnification claim, and which were not
known to the Indemnified Party as of the Claim Date, by delivering an updated
or amended Officer's Certificate to the Representative or applicable
Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be.

(b) Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification.

(i) The Representative may object to a claim for indemnification set forth in
an Officer's Certificate by delivering to the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification a written statement of objection to the claim made in the
Officer's Certificate (an "Objection Notice"); provided, however, that,



to be effective, such Objection Notice must (A) be delivered to the
Indemnified Party prior to 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the thirtieth (30th)
day following the Claim Date of the applicable Officer's Certificate (such
deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for such Officer's Certificate and the
claims for indemnification contained therein) and (B) set forth in reasonable
detail the nature of the objections to the claims in respect of which the
objection is made.

(ii) To the extent that the Representative does not object in writing (as
provided in Section 10.4(b)(i)) to the claims contained in an Officer's
Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline for such Officer's Certificate,
such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the
Representative (or the applicable Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be)
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claims for
Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate (and such entitlement shall be
conclusively and irrefutably established) with respect to the applicable
parties against the applicable Indemnifying Parties (any such claim, an
"Unobjected Claim"). Within thirty (30) days of a claim becoming an Unobjected
Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall make the applicable payment to such
Indemnified Party, subject to Sections 10.3(a), 10.3(b) and 10.4(e).

(c) Resolution of Conflicts.

(i) In case the Representative timely delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 10.4(b)(i) hereof, the Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Parties shall attempt in
good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying
Parties) and the Indemnified Parties reach an agreement, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by all applicable parties
(any claims covered by such an agreement, "Settled Claims"). Any amounts
required to be paid as a result of a Settled Claim shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the Settled Claim
within thirty (30) days of the applicable claim becoming a Settled Claim,
subject to Sections 10.3(a), 10.3(b) and 10.4(e).

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation prior to
forty-five (45) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, then upon the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period Parent, Buyer or the
Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) may submit any such
dispute for resolution pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.9. Judgment
upon any award rendered pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.9 may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Claims determined pursuant to the
provisions of Section 11.9 are referred to herein as "Resolved Claims."

(d) Payable and Unresolved Claims. A "Payable Claim" shall mean a claim for
indemnification of Losses under this Article 10, to the extent that such claim
has not yet been satisfied by cash payment or by release to the Indemnified
Party of funds from the Escrow Fund, that is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii) a
Settled Claim or (iii) an Unobjected Claim. An "Unresolved Claim" shall mean
any claim for indemnification of Losses under this Article 10 specified in any
Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 10.4(a), to the extent
that such claim is not a Payable Claim and has not been satisfied by cash
payment or release to the Indemnified Party of funds from the Escrow Fund.

(e) Payment of Indemnification Claims from Escrow Fund; Distribution of the
Escrow Fund.

(i) Subject to Sections 10.4(a), (b) and (c) above, by virtue of this
Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for
in Article 10, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties
shall have the right (but not the obligation), in the manner provided in



this Section 10.4(e)(i), to recover the amount of any Losses with respect to
which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification hereunder by the
release of funds from the Escrow Fund.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, each of Parent and Buyer is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time to set off any and all Payable Claims against the
Escrow Fund without the consent of the Representative.

(iii) If the amounts held in the Escrow Fund are reduced pursuant to Section
10.3 or Section 10.4 or the Escrow Agreement, Parent and Buyer shall be
entitled to permanently retain such amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, all claims for indemnification by an
Indemnified Party for Losses pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Certificates shall be satisfied (i) first, from the Escrow Fund so
long as the amount in the Escrow Fund is greater than zero, and (ii) second,
against the Indemnifying Parties directly not exceeding such Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Share of such Losses and subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article 10, but only to the extent that such Losses cannot be
recovered from the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that claims or recoveries
in respect of any fraud in connection with, or any willful breach of, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Certificates may be made in the sole
and absolute discretion of the Indemnified Parties either from the Escrow Fund
or directly against the Indemnifying Parties rather than from the Escrow Fund;
provided, further, to the extent an Indemnified Party recovers any amounts in
connection therewith such recovered amounts shall not reduce the amount the
Indemnified Parties may recover with respect to any other Indemnifiable
Matters.

(iv) Promptly after the Survival Date, Parent or Buyer will notify the
Representative in writing of the amount retained to satisfy all claims for
indemnification that have been asserted pursuant to a valid Officer's
Certificate, but not resolved on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (California time) on
the Survival Date (each such claim a "Continuing Claim" and such amount, the
"Retained Escrow Amount"). On the Escrow Release Date, an amount equal to (i)
the amount held in the Escrow Fund as of the Survival Date (as reduced from
time to time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) minus (ii) an amount
equal to the Retained Escrow Amount, shall be transferred and delivered to the
Indemnifying Parties with each Indemnifying Party to receive a portion thereof
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the amount to be distributed
by (B) such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share. Following the Escrow Release
Date, after resolution and payment of a Continuing Claim any amounts remaining
in the Escrow Fund with respect to such resolved and paid Continuing Claim
(other than amounts retained to satisfy other Continuing Claims, which shall
be retained in the Escrow Fund until resolution of the applicable Continuing
Claim, shall be released promptly thereafter in accordance with the provisions
of the Escrow Agreement and the Holdback Agreement, as the case may be), shall
promptly be transferred and delivered to the Company Shareholders in an amount
with respect to each Company Shareholders equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the amount to be distributed by (B) such Indemnifying Party's
Pro Rata Share. The distributions provided in this Section 10.4(e)(iv) are
subject to the terms of Section 10.6(b), the Holdback Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Upon any distribution from the Escrow Fund, the Representative
shall provide Parent, Buyer and the Escrow Agent with payment delivery
instructions for the payments to be made from the Escrow Fund to each
Indemnifying Party and Parent and Buyer will be entitled to rely on such
instructions for purposes of satisfying its obligation to distribute the
Escrow Amount to the Indemnifying Parties.

(v) Any amounts payable to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to clause (iii)
above (A) shall be rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) of a Dollar
(with amounts 0.005 and above rounded up) and (B) if subject to applicable Tax
withholding shall be transferred to the Paying Agent prior to distribution and
Paying Agent will then deduct the appropriate Tax withholding amounts and
distribute



net funds to the applicable Indemnifying Party. If the sum of the final
amounts payable to the Indemnifying Parties, rounded as a result of the
preceding sentence, does not equal the remaining Escrow Amount, then the
appropriate amount will be added or subtracted from the Indemnifying Party
with the greatest Pro Rata Share, such that the sum of such final amounts does
equal the remaining Escrow Amount.

(f) Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Indemnifying Parties, the
Representative, Parent and Buyer agree to treat (and cause their affiliates to
treat) any payments received pursuant to Section 10.2 as adjustments to the
Total Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by
Law.

10.5 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent or Buyer becomes aware of a third
party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent or Buyer reasonably believe
may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.5,
Parent or Buyer shall promptly notify the Representative in writing of such
claim, and the Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, at their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
the defense of such Third Party Claim. No delay in providing such notice shall
affect an Indemnified Parties' rights hereunder unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Representative or the Contributing Securityholders are
prejudiced thereby. Parent and Buyer shall have the right in their respective
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim (it being
understand that, without limiting Parent's and Buyer's discretion to determine
strategy with respect to such claim, Parent and Buyer shall on an overall
basis defend such claim with reasonable diligence and in good faith) and the
Representative shall not be entitled to participate in any negotiation of
settlement, adjustment or compromise with respect to any such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that Parent and Buyer may not settle any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Representative (which consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided further,
however, that the consent of the Representative with respect to any settlement
of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Representative shall have objected within thirty (30) days after a written
request for such consent by Parent. In the event that the Representative has
consented to any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Indemnifying
Parties or the consenting Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, shall have no
power or authority to object under any provision of this Section 10.5 to the
amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise constituting a Payable
Claim.

10.6 Representative. Each of the Indemnifying Parties hereby appoints the
Representative as his, her or its true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-
in-fact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement on
their behalf and exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion
conferred on him or her under this Agreement.

(a) Powers of the Representative.

(i) The Representative shall have and may exercise all of the powers conferred
upon it pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which shall
include:

(A) The power to execute any agreement or instrument in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for and on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, including this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(B) The power to give or receive any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement,
document or instrument entered into or executed in connection herewith, to be
given or received by any Indemnifying Party, and each of them (other than
notice for service of process relating to any Action before a court or other
tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must be given to each
Indemnifying Party individually, as applicable),



and to take any and all action for and on behalf of Indemnifying Parties, and
each of them, under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other such
agreement, document or instrument;

(C) The power (subject to the provisions of Section 10.6(a) hereof) to
contest, negotiate, defend, compromise or settle any indemnification claims or
Actions for which an Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
through counsel selected by the Representative and solely at the cost, risk
and expense of the Indemnifying Parties, authorize payment to any Indemnified
Party of any of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of
any indemnification claims, agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such indemnification claims, resolve any
indemnification claims, take any actions in connection with the resolution of
any dispute relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby by
arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions
permitted or required of any Indemnifying Party or necessary in the judgment
of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the
other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement;

(D) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Parties;

(E) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any payment obligation, in each case,
on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, as contemplated thereunder;

(F) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Parties
(other than the payment of the Total Consideration in accordance with the
terms hereof and in the manner provided herein); and

(G) The power to take any actions contemplated hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement and otherwise in regard to such other matters as are reasonably
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and in
the Escrow Agreement or as the Representative reasonably believes are in the
best interests of the Indemnifying Parties;

provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the powers conferred above shall not authorize or
empower the Representative to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing (i)
in a manner that improperly discriminates between or among the Indemnifying
Parties; or (ii) as to any matter insofar as such matter relates solely and
exclusively to a single Indemnifying Party, whereupon the Representative may
appoint the Indemnifying Party who is alleged to be in breach to handle all
matters related to such indemnification claim on behalf of the Representative,
and all references to the Representative in such event shall include also such
Indemnifying Party. Without implying that other actions would constitute an
improper discrimination, each of the Indemnifying Parties agrees that
discrimination between or among Indemnifying Parties solely on the basis of
the respective number of Company Securities held by each Indemnifying Party or
their respective Pro Rata Shares shall not be deemed to be improper. Further,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Representative shall not
be entitled to, and shall not, including by way of amending or waiving any
provision hereof, take any action on behalf of any Indemnifying Party that
would or could (i) cause any Indemnifying Party's liability hereunder to
exceed its portion of the Escrow Amount, (ii) result in the amounts payable
hereunder to any Indemnifying Party being distributed in any manner other than
as set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (iii) result in an
increase of any Indemnifying Party's indemnity or other obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement (including,



for the avoidance of doubt, any change to the nature of the indemnity
obligations), without (in each case) such Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent.

(b) Representations of Representative. The Representative hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Buyer as follows:

(i) The Representative has all necessary power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to carry out his, her or
its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Representative
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Buyer and the Company, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of the Representative, enforceable against the Representative in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar
laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors,
and to general equity principles and to the laws of agency.

(iii) The Escrow Agreement will be duly executed and delivered by the
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
the Escrow Agreement by Buyer and the Escrow Agent, constitute a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Representative, enforceable against the
Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles and to
the laws of agency.

(c) Representative Procedures Upon Receipt of Indemnification Claims.

(i) Upon receipt or notice of any Officer's Certificate, the Representative
shall give prompt notice of the amount and details thereof (to the extent of
the information in his or her possession) to the Indemnifying Parties who sign
that certain Engagement Letter to be entered into by and among the
Representative, the Company and certain of the Indemnifying Parties. As soon
as possible thereafter, the Representative shall notify such Indemnifying
Parties of the proposed action which the Representative recommends shall be
taken in response to such Officer's Certificate.

(ii) Any action taken by the Representative, including authorizing the
distribution to any Indemnified Party of any portion of the Escrow Fund,
subject to the limitations of Section 10.6(a), shall be binding upon the
Company Securityholders vis-a-vis Parent and Buyer for all intents and
purposes.

(d) Notices. Except to the extent that this Agreement requires that a notice
be made to an Indemnifying Party, any notice given to the Representative will
constitute notice to each and all of the Indemnifying Parties at the time
notice is given to the Representative. Any action taken by, or notice or
instruction received from, the Representative will be deemed to be action by,
or notice or instruction from, each and all of the Indemnifying Parties.
Except as otherwise contained herein or in the Escrow Agreement, Buyer and the
Company may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or instruction
received from any one or more individual Indemnifying Parties.

(e) Agreement of the Representative. The Representative hereby agrees to do
such acts, and execute further documents, as shall be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(f) Reimbursement and Liability of Representative.

(i) At the Closing, the Representative Expense Amount shall be deducted from
the amounts due to each holder of Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b),
the amounts payable in respect of Vested Company Options pursuant to Section
2.2(a) and amounts payable in respect of Vested Promised Options pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and transferred to the Representative to be held as agent and
for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties in a segregated client account, as
an expense fund to pay directly, or reimburse the Representative for, such
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative in the
performance of his or her duties hereunder. The Indemnifying Parties
acknowledge that the Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice. The Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Any remaining funds not used by the Representative shall be paid
to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Indemnifying Parties
contributing to such fund, based on each Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share,
upon conclusion of the Representative's duties hereunder. However, in any
event (and particularly in the event that the Representative Expense Fund is
not sufficient to cover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Representative in the performance of his or her duties hereunder), each
Indemnifying Party agrees that such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of
such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered by the
Representative Expense Fund may be deducted by the Representative from amounts
distributed to the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, from
the Escrow Fund immediately prior to delivery of such Escrow Fund to the
Indemnifying Parties.

(ii) The Representative will incur no liability to the Indemnifying Parties
with respect to any action taken or suffered by the Representative in reliance
upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document
believed by the Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the
proper person (and the Representative shall have no responsibility to
determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction,
except its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Except as
expressly provided herein, the Representative will not be required to take any
action involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or
provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Representative.

(iii) The Indemnifying Parties shall severally (but not jointly), based solely
on their respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify the Representative and hold the
Representative harmless against any claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of
action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively,
"Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the Representative's duties hereunder, in each case as
such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; provided that in the event
it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion thereof
was primarily caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying
Parties the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to
such gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. If not paid directly
to the Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i) the funds in the
Representative Expense Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund otherwise
distributable to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written
instructions delivered by the Representative to the Escrow Agent; provided
that while this section allows the Representative to be paid from the
Representative Expense Fund and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the
Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as such Representative Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise.



10.7 Reliance on Representative. Buyer and its affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
the appointment of the Representative and treat such Representative as the
duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Party (subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 10.4(b)) and as having the duties, power and
authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. None of
Buyer or its respective affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company)
or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any Indemnifying Party for any actions
taken or omitted by them in reliance upon any instructions, notice or other
instruments delivered by the Representative for which it was authorized
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.4(b) above. No resignation of the
Representative shall become effective unless at least 30 days prior written
notice of the replacement or resignation of such Representative shall be
provided to Buyer and the Escrow Agent. Buyer and its respective affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company) and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely at any time after receipt of any such notice on the most
recent notice so received. The Indemnifying Parties holding seventy five
percent (75%) interest in the Escrow Fund may remove the Representative by a
written instrument delivered to the Representative, Buyer and the Company,
and, in such event and also if the Representative shall be unable or unwilling
to serve in such capacity, his, her or its successor who shall serve and
exercise the powers of the Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a
written instrument signed by Indemnifying Parties holding seventy five percent
(75%) interest in the Escrow Fund held in escrow at such time and delivered to
Buyer and the Escrow Agent.

hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and
permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties may assign or transfer any of their respective rights or obligations

11.3 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties' rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, and any such invalidity, illegality and
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

11.4 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions (without proof of damages) to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are



entitled at Law or in equity and the parties hereby agree to waive any
requirements for posting a bond in connection with any such action.

11.5 Other Remedies. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

11.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule (and
all exhibits and schedules thereto) and all Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement, and the Related Agreements are complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement
relied upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such
Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or any Related Agreement, and this
Agreement, including such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and any
Related Agreement supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the extent that
they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

11.7 Third Parties. Except as specifically set forth or referred to herein,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and are not necessarily
intended as characterization of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any earlier date. Without limiting anything else in
this Section 11.7, the representations and warranties made in this Agreement
are not intended to, and do not, confer upon any Person (other than the
parties hereto and, to the extent expressly permitted, such parties'
assignees) any rights or remedies hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 8.19 are
statements of intent and no Continuing Employee or other Person (including any
third-party to such provisions who is a party hereto) shall have any rights or
remedies, including rights of enforcement, with respect thereto and no
Continuing Employee or other Person is or is intended to be a third-party
beneficiary thereof.

11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of California applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state (without giving
effect to the conflicts of Laws provisions thereof).

11.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. By execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal courts located in the Northern District of the
State of California in the United States of America for the purpose of
resolving any and all disputes arising under this Agreement (including any
indemnification claims under Article 10) and not as a general submission to
such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim
whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of process
out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by
the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such
party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process
shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. The parties
hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding
under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the foregoing courts
on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that it or any of



its property is immune from the above-described legal process, (ii) that such
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the
action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such courts, or (iii) any other defense that would hinder or delay the
levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party hereto is
entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery") shall be treated
in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

11.11 Inter-Securityholders Agreement. By execution of this Agreement, Netanel
Davidi, on the one hand, and the other Company Shareholders, on the other
hand, covenant and agree to work in good faith to negotiate and execute a
definitive Inter-Securityholders Agreement prior to the Closing, which
agreement shall include certain provisions relating to the treatment of the
Founder Retained Amount; it being acknowledged, agreed and understood that the
failure of Netanel Davidi, on the one hand, and the other Company
Shareholders, on the other hand, to negotiate or execute such Inter-
Securityholder Agreement shall not alter, affect or modify any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement, including (a) the conditions set forth in
Section 3.3 and (b) the covenants set forth in Article 7 and Article 8 and (c)
the indemnification obligations set forth in Article 10.
