a certificate of merger effecting the AMLP GP Merger to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
duly executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA,
as applicable. The AMLP GP Merger shall become effective at the time when such
certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and

 



      
 

 



 

specified in such certificate of merger. At the effective time of the AMLP GP

and agree to be bound by the provisions of the AMLP Partnership Agreement.

 



 

(c) In the event AMLP GP elects to effect the AMLP GP Merger, at the effective
time of the AMLP GP Merger, (i) the Certificate of Limited Partnership of
AMGP, dated as of May 9, 2017, will remain unchanged and will be the
certificate of limited partnership of AMGP and (ii) the AMGP Partnership
Agreement will remain unchanged and will be the agreement of limited
partnership of AMGP, in each case until the conversion of AMGP from a limited
partnership into a Delaware corporation as set forth in _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(d) Prior to the effective time of the AMLP GP Merger (if applicable) and
prior to the Conversion (as defined below), AMLP GP shall execute and deliver
an amendment to the AMLP Partnership Agreement, substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " **AMLP Partnership Agreement
Amendment** "), pursuant to which, (i) in the event of an AMLP GP Merger, AMGP

debts or liabilities that may not be in connection with or incidental to its
performance as the general partner of AMLP or in relation to the provision of
management services to AMLP, (iii) Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) of the AMLP
Partnership Agreement will not apply to distributions or payments made

be executed and delivered prior to the Conversion and shall contain only the
amendments described in clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

2.4 **_AMGP Conversion_**. Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to

Delaware corporation pursuant to and in accordance with Section 17-219 of the
DRULPA, Section 265 of the DGCL and the AMGP Partnership Agreement (the "
**Conversion** "):

 



 

(a) _The Conversion._ At the Conversion Effective Time (as defined below),
AMGP shall be converted to a Delaware corporation to be named Antero Midstream
Corporation (" **AMGP Corp** ") and, for all purposes of the Laws of the State

AMGP to wind up its affairs under Section 17-803 of the DRULPA or to pay its
liabilities and distribute its assets under Section 17-804 of the DRULPA, and
the Conversion shall not constitute a dissolution of AMGP. At the Conversion
Effective Time, for all purposes of the Laws of the State of Delaware, all of
the rights, privileges and powers of AMGP, and all property, real, personal
and mixed, and all debts due to AMGP, as well as all other things and causes
of action belonging to AMGP, shall remain vested in AMGP Corp and shall be the
property of AMGP Corp, and the title to any real property vested by deed or
otherwise in AMGP shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of any
provision of the DRULPA, the DGCL or otherwise; but all rights of creditors
and all liens upon any property of AMGP shall be preserved unimpaired, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of AMGP shall remain attached to AMGP Corp,

 



      
 

 



 

and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts,
liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it in its
capacity as a corporation. The rights, privileges, powers and interests in
property of AMGP, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of AMGP, shall
not be deemed, as a consequence of the Conversion, to have been transferred to
AMGP Corp for any purpose of the Laws of the State of Delaware or otherwise.
As a consequence of the Conversion, in the event the AMLP GP Merger is
consummated, AMGP Corp shall continue as the general partner of AMLP without
any further action of any person or entity.

of AMGP, AMGP GP, AMGP Corp or the former holders of such AMGP Common Shares.

shall instead be uncertificated shares, unless the Board of Directors of AMGP
Corp shall provide by resolution or resolutions otherwise. Promptly after the
Conversion Effective Time, AMGP Corp shall register, or cause to be

Unit it owns (vested and unvested) to NewCo and (ii) NewCo shall transfer to
each Series B Holder such number of shares of AMGP Common Stock equal to the
Series B Exchange Consideration in exchange for each Series B Unit held by
such Series B Holder. Each such share of AMGP Common Stock constituting the

set forth in the IDR Holdings LLC Agreement and (y) vesting in accordance with

time of the Series B Exchange, such amount shall be paid in accordance with
the terms of the IDR Holdings LLC Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The transactions pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ are collectively

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **Merger Consideration**

 



 

3.1 **_Merger Consideration; Effect of the Mergers on Equity Securities_**.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties, any
holder of AMLP Common Units, any holder of AMGP Common Shares or any other
Person:

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 4.5_ and _Section 4.10_, each AMLP Common Unit
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by the
AMLP Public Unitholders (such AMLP Common Units, the " **Public Eligible
Units** "), shall be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration (the " **Public Merger Consideration** "):

 



 

(i) _Mixed Election Units_. Each Public Eligible Unit with respect to which an
election to receive a combination of AMGP Common Stock and cash (such
election, a " **Public Mixed Election** ") has been effectively made and not
revoked pursuant to _Section 3.2_ (each such unit, a " **Public Mixed
Consideration Election Unit** ") and each Public No Election Unit (as defined
in _Section 3.2(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the
combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
**Public Mixed Election Consideration** ") of (A) $3.415 in cash without
interest (the " **Public Standard Cash Consideration** ") and (B) 1.6350
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of AMGP Common Stock (the
" **Public Standard Common Stock Consideration** " and such exchange ratio the
" **Public Standard Mixed Exchange Ratio** ").

 



 

(ii) _Cash Election Units._ Each Public Eligible Unit with respect to which an
election to receive solely cash (such election, a " **Public Cash Election**
") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 3.2_ (each
such unit, a " **Public Cash Election Unit** ") shall be converted into the
right to receive the sum of (A) the Public Standard Cash Consideration plus
(B) the product of the Public Standard Mixed Exchange Ratio multiplied by the
AMGP VWAP, in cash without interest (the " **Public Cash Election
Consideration** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Cash Election Amount
exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then, instead of being converted
into the right to receive the Public Cash Election Consideration, each Public
Cash Election Unit shall be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount
of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Public Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction, the " **Cash Fraction** "), and (B) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of AMGP Common Stock
equal to the product of the Public Common Stock Election Consideration,
multiplied by a fraction equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 



 

(iii) _Common Stock Election Units._ Each Public Eligible Unit with respect to
which an election to receive solely AMGP Common Stock (such election, a

 



      
 

 



 

" **Public Common Stock Election** ") is properly made and not revoked
pursuant to _Section 3.2_ (each such unit, a " **Public Common Stock Election
Unit** ") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of AMGP Common Stock equal to (A)
the Public Standard Mixed Exchange Ratio plus (B) the quotient of the Public
Standard Cash Consideration divided by the AMGP VWAP (such number of shares,
the " **Public Common Stock Election Consideration** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the sum of the
Cash Election Amount and the AR Supplemental Cash Amount, if any, then,
instead of being converted into the right to receive the Public Common Stock
Election Consideration, each Public Common Stock Election Unit shall be
converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest)
equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Public Common
Stock Election Units, and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of AMGP Common Stock equal to the product of the Public
Common Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be (x) the Public Cash Election Consideration minus (y) the amount
calculated in clause (1) of this paragraph, and the denominator of which shall
be the Public Cash Election Consideration.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.5_ and _Section 4.10_, each AMLP Common Unit
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by Antero
Resources or its Subsidiaries (such AMLP Common Units, the " **AR Eligible
Units** ," and together with the Public Eligible Units, the " **Eligible
Units** "), shall be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration (the " **AR Merger Consideration** ," and together with the
Public Merger Consideration, the " **Merger Consideration** "):

 



 

(i) Pursuant to the AMGP Voting Agreement, Antero Resources has irrevocably
elected to receive a combination of AMGP Common Stock and cash with respect to
all AR Eligible Units, as a result of which, subject to the provisions of
_Section 3.1(b)(iv)_, each AR Eligible Unit shall be converted into the right
to receive the combination of (A) $3.00 in cash without interest and (B)
1.6023 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of AMGP Common
Stock (together, the " **AR Mixed Election Consideration** ").

 



 

(ii) Promptly following the Public Election Deadline (but in no event later
than two Business Days after the Public Election Deadline), AMGP shall deliver
to Antero Resources a schedule certified by the Exchange Agent that sets forth
the number of Public Mixed Consideration Election Units, Public Cash Election
Units, Public Common Stock Election Units and Public No Election Units.

 



 

(iii) Within three Business Days after the Public Election Deadline, Antero
Resources shall have the option, exercisable at the direction of the Special
Committee of the board of directors of Antero Resources by giving notice to
AMGP and AMLP (the " **AR Supplemental Cash Election** "), to increase the
total amount of Cash Consideration to be received with respect to all AR
Eligible Units by the amount designated in such notice (the " **AR
Supplemental Cash Amount** "), _provided_ that the AR Supplemental Cash Amount
must not exceed the AR Available Cash Amount. For purposes of this Agreement,
the quotient of the AR Supplemental Cash Amount divided

 



      
 

 



 

by the total number of AR Eligible Units is referred to as the " **AR
Supplemental Cash Per Unit**."

 



 

(iv) If an AR Supplemental Cash Election is made in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)(iii)_, then, notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 3.1(b)(i)_,
each AR Eligible Unit shall be converted into the right to receive the
combination of (A) cash (without interest) in the amount equal to $3.00 plus
the AR Supplemental Cash Per Unit and (B) a number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of AMGP Common Stock equal to (x) 1.6023 minus
(y) the quotient of the AR Supplemental Cash Per Unit divided by the AMGP
VWAP.

 



 

(c) The shares of AMGP Common Stock to be paid as consideration under _Section
3.1(a)_ and _Section 3.1(b)_ are hereinafter referred to as the " **Stock
Consideration** ," and the cash to be paid as consideration under _Section
3.1(a)_ and _Section 3.1(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " **Cash
Consideration**." It is the intent of the Parties that the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger would be the amount if
all holders of Public Eligible Units elected to receive the Public Mixed
Election Consideration with respect to each Public Eligible Unit held and the
holder of the AR Eligible Units elected to receive the AR Mixed Election
Consideration with respect to each AR Eligible Unit held.

 



 

(d) All of the Eligible Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.1_ shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Units (each, a "
**Certificate** ") and each book-entry account formerly representing any non-
certificated Eligible Units (each, a " **Book-Entry Unit** ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive (i) the applicable Merger Consideration
and (ii) pursuant to _Section 4.5_, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
into which such Eligible Units have been converted pursuant to this _Section
3.1_, (iii) any distributions pursuant to _Section 4.3_, and (iv) any
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by AMLP GP on such Eligible Units on or prior to the
Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the Closing Date, in each case
without interest.

 



 

(e) Each of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of
Merger Sub held by NewCo shall be automatically converted into a number of
common units in the Surviving Entity equal to the number of AMLP Common Units
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. The AMLP IDRs
and the AMLP General Partner Interest shall remain outstanding and shall
continue unaffected by the Merger.

 



 

3.2 **_Election Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
in such form as AMGP shall reasonably specify and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to AMLP (the " **Election Form** ") shall be mailed no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date
as AMGP and AMLP shall mutually agree (the " **Mailing Date** ") to each
holder of Public Eligible Units as of the close of business on the fifth
business day prior to the Mailing Date (the " **Election Form Record
Date**").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of such holders Public Eligible Units with respect to which
such holder makes a Public Mixed Election; (ii) the number of such holders
Public Eligible Units with respect to which such holder makes a Public Cash
Election; and (iii) the number of such holders Public Eligible Units with
respect to which such holder makes a Public Common Stock Election. Any Public
Eligible Units with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the later of (A) the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date
and (B) ten (10) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or such other
time and date as AMGP and AMLP shall agree) (the " **Public Election
Deadline** ") shall be deemed to be " **Public No Election Units** ". The
holders of such Public No Election Units shall be deemed to have made a Public
Mixed Election with respect to such Public No Election Units.

 



 

(c) AMGP shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of AMLP Common Units between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Public Election Deadline,
and AMLP shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

 



 

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Public
Election Deadline. After a Public Mixed Election, a Public Cash Election or a
Public Common Stock Election is validly made with respect to any Public
Eligible Units, any subsequent transfer of such Public Eligible Units shall
automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Public Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Public Election Deadline, the
Public Eligible Units represented by such Election Form shall become Public No
Election Units, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such Public Eligible Units prior to the Public
Election Deadline, in which case such subsequent election shall be deemed to
be validly made with respect to such Public Eligible Units. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of parties hereto
or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in an Election Form.

 



 

3.3 **_Treatment of AMLP Phantom Units_**.

 



 

(a) _AMLP Phantom Units_. At the Effective Time, each award of AMLP phantom
units (each, an " **AMLP Phantom Unit Award** ") granted pursuant to the
Antero Midstream Partners LP Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, restated,
modified or supplemented from time to time, the " **AMLP LTIP** ") that
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by AMGP and converted into a restricted stock unit
or similar award of AMGP (each, a " **Converted AMLP Phantom Unit Award** ")
under the AMGP LTIP or new omnibus equity incentive plan adopted by AMGP, with
substantially the same terms

 



      
 

 



 

and conditions (including with respect to vesting) applicable to such
Converted AMLP Phantom Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
representing the right to receive a number of shares of AMGP Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number
of AMLP Common Units subject to such AMLP Phantom Unit Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. At
the Effective Time, all distribution equivalent rights (each, an " **AMLP DER
Award** ") granted in tandem with a corresponding AMLP Phantom Unit Award
shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be assumed by AMGP and converted into a distribution equivalent right award
(or similar award) (each, a " **Converted AMLP DER Award** ") under the AMGP
LTIP or new omnibus equity incentive plan adopted by AMGP, with substantially
the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) applicable
to such Converted AMLP DER Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
representing the right to receive (i) any balance accrued with respect to such
Converted AMLP DER Award as of the Effective Time in respect of distributions
paid by AMLP in respect of the underlying the AMLP Phantom Unit Award to which
such Converted AMLP DER Award relates and (ii) any dividends paid or
distributions made by AMGP from and after the Effective Time with respect to
the number of shares of AMGP Common Stock subject to the corresponding
Converted AMLP Phantom Unit Award to which such Converted AMLP DER Award
relates.

 



 

(b) _AMLP Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, AMLP and the AMLP GP
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the AMLP Phantom Unit Awards and
to give effect to this _Section 3.3_. AMLP shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither AMLP nor the
Surviving Entity will be required to deliver AMLP Common Units or other units
of AMLP to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of AMLP Phantom Unit
Awards. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, AMLP shall file a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 registration statement filed by AMLP
on November 12, 2014 deregistering all AMLP Common Units thereunder.

 



 

(c) _AMGP Actions_. AMGP, AMGP GP and AMGP Corp shall take all actions that
are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the AMLP Phantom Unit
Awards pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, including the reservation, issuance and
listing of shares of AMGP Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.3_. Prior to and at the Effective Time, AMGP,
AMGP GP and AMGP Corp will take all actions with respect to the amendment,
restatement or other modification of the AMGP LTIP or the assumption of the
AMGP LTIP by AMGP Corp (or, if AMGP and AMGP GP so determine, the adoption of
a new omnibus equity incentive plan), the provision of any requisite AMGP,
AMGP GP or AMGP Corp board of directors and/or equityholder approval, and the
filing of a new or amended Form S-8 registration statement or a post-effective
amendment to an existing Form S-8 registration statement (or any other
appropriate form) with respect to shares of AMGP Common Stock available for
grant and delivery under the AMGP LTIP or any such new omnibus equity
incentive plan, in each case, as may be determined by AMGP, AMGP GP or AMGP
Corp in their discretion.

AMLPs prior approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) to serve as the exchange agent (the " **Exchange Agent**
"), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Units, an aggregate number of
shares of AMGP Common Stock in uncertificated book-entry form equal to the
number of shares of AMGP Common Stock to be paid by NewCo as Stock
Consideration under _Section 3.1_. At or prior to the Effective Time, AMLP
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Eligible Units, an aggregate amount of cash equal to
the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash to be paid by AMLP as Cash
Consideration under _Section 3.1_ and (b) the aggregate amount of cash to be
paid by AMLP in lieu of any fractional shares to holders of Eligible Units
pursuant to _Section 4.5_. In addition, AMGP shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time, any dividends, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Units
may be entitled pursuant to _Section 4.3_ with both a record and payment date
after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Units
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Such shares of AMGP Common Stock
deposited by NewCo with the Exchange Agent and cash deposited by AMLP with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 4.1_, is referred to in this
Agreement as the " **Exchange Fund** ". The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement.
The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent
as reasonably directed by AMLP prior to the Effective Time and by AMGP after
the Effective Time. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of
the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

4.2 **_Procedures for Surrender_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within four (4)
Business Days thereafter), AMGP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Eligible Units that are (i) Certificates or (ii) Book-
Entry Units not held through The Depositary Trust Company (" **DTC** ") notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A)
appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or such Book-Entry Units shall
pass only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates, as provided in _Section 4.7_) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Unit to the Exchange Agent, such materials to be in such form and have such
other provisions as the AMGP Parties desire with approval of the AMLP Parties
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "
**Letter of Transmittal** "), and (B) instructions for surrendering the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or
transferring the Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMGP Common Stock,
if any, to be paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends payable
pursuant to _Section 4.3_, in each case, to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. With respect to Book-Entry Units held
through DTC, AMGP and AMLP shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominees on the Closing Date (or if Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m.
(New York Time) on the Closing Date,

 



      
 

 



 

on the first Business Day after the Closing Date), upon surrender of Eligible
Units held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary
surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of AMGP Common Stock, if any, to be paid in consideration therefor, and
cash for the amount of any dividends payable pursuant to _Section 4.3_, in
each case, to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Units that are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in _Section 4.7_) or that are Book-
Entry Units in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and
accompanying instructions or, with respect to Book-Entry Units held through
DTC, in accordance with DTCs customary procedures and such other procedures
as agreed by NewCo, AMLP, AMGP, the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (after giving effect to any required Tax withholding as provided in
_Section 4.8_) (i) that number of whole shares of AMGP Common Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive as Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1_ and (ii) a check in the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
receive: (A) as Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (B) in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.5_, and (C) with respect to
any dividends that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
4.3_.

 



 

(c) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Units and any Certificate or ledger entry relating to
Book-Entry Units formerly representing AMLP Common Units that have been so
surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Units
that is not registered in the transfer records of AMLP, (x) payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration, (y) cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 4.5_ and (z) cash for the amount of any
dividends pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (in each case, after giving effect to any
required Tax withholding as provided in _Section 4.8_), may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Units is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable unit
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and
substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. With respect to
Book-Entry Units, (x) payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, (y) cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.5_, and (z)
dividends pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (in each case, after giving effect to any
required Tax withholding as provided in _Section 4.8_), shall be made only to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Units are registered in the unit
transfer books of AMLP.

 



 

4.3 **_Dividends_**. All shares of AMGP Common Stock to be paid pursuant to
the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend is declared by AMGP in respect of the AMGP Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends in respect of all shares of AMGP Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends in respect of the AMGP Common Stock
shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Unit until the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section 4.7_) or Book-Entry Unit is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this _Article IV_. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be paid to the holder
of record of

 



      
 

 



 

the whole shares of AMGP Common Stock paid in exchange for Eligible Units, in
accordance with this _Article IV_, without interest, (a) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends in respect of AMGP Common Stock with a record date at
or after the Effective Time and payment date prior to or on the date of
surrender and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends payable with
respect to such whole shares of AMGP Common Stock with a record date at or
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

4.4 **_Transfers_**. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the unit transfer books of AMLP of the AMLP Common Units that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

4.5 **_No Fractional Shares_**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of AMGP Common Stock will be paid upon the
conversion of AMLP Common Units pursuant to _Section 3.1_. All fractional
shares of AMGP Common Stock that a holder of Eligible Units would be otherwise
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ shall be aggregated and rounded
to three decimal places. Any holder of Eligible Units otherwise entitled to
receive fractional shares of AMGP Common Stock but for this _Section 4.5_
shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, rounded to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (a) the aggregated amount of the
fractional interest in AMGP Common Stock to which such holder would, but for
this _Section 4.5_, be entitled and (b) an amount equal to the average of the
volume weighted average price per unit of AMGP Common Shares on the NYSE (as
reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by AMGP and AMLP) on each of the ten
(10) consecutive trading days ending with the complete trading day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No holder of Eligible Units shall be entitled by
virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMGP
Common Stock described in this _Section 4.5_ to any dividends, voting rights
or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of AMGP Common Stock.
The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMGP Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 



 

4.6 **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any shares
of AMGP Common Stock) that remains unclaimed twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to NewCo or AMLP, as set forth in the last
sentence of this _Section 4.6_. Any holder of Eligible Units who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to
NewCo or AMLP, as applicable, for delivery of the Merger Consideration and
payment of any cash and dividends in respect thereof payable and/or issuable
pursuant to _Section 3.1_, _Section 4.3_, and _Section 4.5_, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Entity, AMGP, NewCo, AMLP, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of AMLP Common Units for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Unit has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger
Consideration and the cash, if any, to be paid in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Unit shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of NewCo or AMLP, as
applicable, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, any amount of cash to be
returned to AMLP pursuant to this

 



       
 

 



 

 _Section 4.6 _shall be so returned to AMLP to the extent such amount of cash
was initially contributed to the Exchange Fund by AMLP pursuant to _Section
4.1_, and any amount of shares of AMGP Common Stock to be returned to NewCo
pursuant to this _Section 4.6_ shall be so returned to NewCo to the extent
such amount of shares of AMGP Common Stock were initially contributed to the
Exchange Fund by NewCo pursuant to _Section 4.1_.

 



 

4.7 **_Lost_** _, **Stolen or Destroyed Certificates**_. In the event any
Certificate representing Eligible Units shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by AMGP, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by the AMGP as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration and any cash or unpaid dividends that would be payable or
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 



 

4.8 **_Withholding Rights_**. Each of AMGP, NewCo, AMLP and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the
consideration to be paid with respect to the Series B Exchange or any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law
(and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and
withholding may be taken in shares of AMGP Common Stock). To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld by AMGP, NewCo, AMLP or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted
by AMGP, NewCo, AMLP or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding was made.

 



 

4.9 **_No Dissenters  Rights_**. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the Transactions.

 



 

4.10 **_Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Article IX_, the
issued and outstanding AMLP Common Units or the issued and outstanding AMGP
Common Shares, shall have been changed into a different number of units or
securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification, unit or
share split (including a reverse unit or share split), unit or share
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, or a distribution paid in units or shares with a
record date within such period shall have been declared, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of AMLP
Common Units and AMGP Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from
and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration. Nothing in this
_Section 4.10_ shall be construed to permit AMGP or AMLP to take any action
except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the
terms of this Agreement.

taken as a whole.

the AMGP Parties or the AMLP Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by any party that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the

exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the Transactions) now existing in favor of the
AMLP DandO Indemnified Parties as provided in the Organizational Documents of
any member of the AMLP Group, under applicable Delaware Law or otherwise, and
shall ensure that the Organizational Documents of AMLP shall, for a period of

directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents of AMLP and the AMLP GP as of the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, AMGP Corp shall
maintain officers and directors liability insurance with a nationally
reputable carrier covering each AMLP DandO Indemnified Party who is or at any
time prior to the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and
directors liability insurance applicable to the AMLP Group (" **D andO
Insurance**"), on terms substantially no less advantageous to the AMLP DandO
Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether
claims, actions or other Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted
or claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided, however, that AMGP
Corp shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for
the AMLP DandO Indemnified Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium currently paid by AMGP or AMGP GP for such insurance, but shall

that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this
Section 7.12 are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any AMLP DandO
Indemnified Party under this Section 7.12 shall be in addition to any other
rights such AMLP DandO Indemnified Party may have under the Organizational
Documents of any member of the AMLP Group or applicable Law.

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then and in either such case, AMGP Corp shall cause proper provision to be
made so that its successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.12.

 



 

7.13 **_Takeover Statutes_**. Each party shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement or

Agreement or the Transaction, the parties shall grant such approvals and shall
use reasonable best efforts to take such actions so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

condition to the consummation of any of the Transactions.

 



 

9.3 **_Termination by the AMLP Parties_**. This Agreement may be terminated by
the AMLP Parties and the Transactions may be abandoned if:

omission.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **Miscellaneous and General**

 



 

10.1 **_Survival_**. No representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Transactions or the
termination of this Agreement, except for (a) any such covenants and
agreements in _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.6_ and _Article X_ and (b) any
covenants and agreement in this Agreement that contemplates performance after
the Effective Time.

 



       
 

 



 

10.2 **_Modification or Amendment_**. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time but before the AMGP
Shareholder Approval or AMLP Unitholder Approval shall have been obtained, the
parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement of the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such amendments or
modifications must be approved by the AMLP Conflicts Committee and AMGP
Conflicts Committee. After the AMGP Shareholder Approval or AMLP Unitholder
Approval has been obtained, no modification or amendment of this Agreement
shall be made which by Law would require the further approval of the holders
of AMGP Common Shares or AMLP Common Units, as applicable, without first
obtaining such further approval.

 



 

10.3 **_Waiver of Conditions; Any Determinations_** _, **Decisions** ,
**Etc.**_ The conditions to each of the parties obligations to consummate the
Transaction are for the sole benefit of such party and, except to the extent
expressly provided herein, may be waived by such party in whole or in part to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws; _provided, however_ , that any such
waiver shall only be effective if made in writing; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the AMLP Parties or the AMGP Parties, as the case may be, may not make or
authorize any such waiver without the prior approval of the AMLP GP Board
(subject to approval of the AMLP Conflicts Committee) or the AMGP GP Board
(subject to approval of the AMGP Conflicts Committee), as applicable. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder or under applicable
Law shall not constitute a waiver of such rights and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no single or partial exercise by any party of any
of its rights hereunder precludes any other or further exercise of such rights
or any other rights hereunder or under applicable Law. Whenever a
determination, decision, approval, notice or consent of the AMLP Parties or
the AMGP Parties is permitted or required pursuant to or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement, such determination, decision, approval, notice
or consent must be authorized or made by the AMLP GP Board and AMLP Conflicts
Committee, in the case of the AMLP Parties, or the AMGP GP Board and AMGP
Conflicts Committee, in the case of the AMGP Parties (unless otherwise
expressly contemplated under the terms of this Agreement).

 



 

10.4 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

 



 

10.5 **_GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE_**.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in the event, but only in the
event, that such court declines to accept jurisdiction over such proceeding,
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or,
if subject matter jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the federal courts of
the United States of America, the federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware, solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause of

 



      
 

 



 

action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents
referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding
for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.6_ or in such other manner
as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.5_.

 



 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that
immediate and irreparable harm would likewise occur if the Merger or any of
the other Transactions were not consummated (unless this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to the provisions herein) and the holders of AMLP Common
Units did not receive the aggregate consideration payable to them in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement). It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or in the event, but only in the event, that such court
declines to accept jurisdiction over such proceeding, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter
jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States
of America, the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action is brought
in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege,
and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. Each party further agrees that no other party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section
10.5(c)_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

(d) To the extent any party brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth Business Day following the
resolution of such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

10.6 **_Notices_**. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

delivered pursuant to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER THE AMGP
PARTIES NOR THE AMLP PARTIES MAKES OR RELIES ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE
BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

receive the Merger Consideration), _Section 2.9 _(with respect to the rights
of the former holders of Series B Units to receive AMLP Common Units in the

respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in

Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



      
 

 



 

10.9 **_Transfer Taxes_**. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

10.10 **_Severability_**. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

10.11 **_Successors and Assigns_**. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the AMGP Parties
may designate, by written notice to the AMLP Parties, another wholly owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary in lieu of NewCo or Merger Sub, in which event
all references herein to NewCo or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to NewCo or Merger Sub, as applicable, as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;
_provided, however,_ that any such designation shall not materially impede or
delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the holders of AMLP Common Units under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void.
