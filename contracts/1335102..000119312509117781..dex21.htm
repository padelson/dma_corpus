transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made

compensate Parent and the Purchaser, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent&#146;s right to
receive payment of the Termination Fee from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Purchaser against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
