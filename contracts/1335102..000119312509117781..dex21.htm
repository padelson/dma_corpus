_Agreement_ "), dated as of May 21, 2009, is by and among Johnson and Johnson,
a New Jersey corporation (" _Parent_ "), Kite Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has
agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $43.00 (such amount or any
different amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ ") net to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the
Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company with the
Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ ," and together with the
Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
_Transactions_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share,
other than (i) Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the
Company and (ii) the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, (i) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the Companys stockholders accept
the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the extent applicable,
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger;

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition to Parents and Purchasers
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the    Company are entering into Tender and Support Agreements with Parent
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, whereby, among other things, such
stockholders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, to tender the Shares held by them in the Offer and support any
and all corporate action necessary to consummate the Merger.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) business days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares
which, together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or
Purchaser (if any), represents at least a majority of the Shares then
outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) (the " _Minimum Condition_
"); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I (together with the Minimum
Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the prior satisfaction of
the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser,
of the other Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth
in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Purchaser
expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in whole or
in part, any Offer Condition, to  



 

2  increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by
the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares
to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer
Conditions in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares or impose
conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) amend or modify
any of the terms of the Offer in a manner that is adverse to the holders of
Shares or (vii) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time in a manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is twenty (20) business days following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the "
_Expiration Time_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time only as follows:

(i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. Subject to the right of Parent to
terminate this Agreement (and the Offer) in accordance with _Section 8.1_, if
on any then scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions shall not
have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder,
Purchaser may (in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company), and to
the extent requested in writing by the Company prior to such scheduled
Expiration Time Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), extend
the Offer for one or more periods of up to ten (10) business days each until
the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided, however_ , that
Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond November 21, 2009
(the " _Outside Date_ ").

(ii) _Required by Applicable Law_. Subject to the right of Parent to terminate
this Agreement (and the Offer) in accordance with _Section 8.1_, Purchaser
shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law,
interpretation or position of the SEC (or its staff) applicable to the Offer.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall affect any termination rights in
_Section 8.1_.

(g) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to the exercise
of the Top-Up Option) to reach the Short Form Threshold, Purchaser may,
in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one
or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act of up to twenty (20) 



 

3  business days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately
accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer
Documents shall provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period"
in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.1(g)_.

(h) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer.

(i) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
"), pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "),
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly after the date hereof furnish
to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Company required by
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC,
and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any
oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase
of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.



 

4 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements
and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2_, contain a recommendation by the Company Board
of Directors recommending that the holders of the Shares accept the Offer,
tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and, if necessary under
applicable Law, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly after the date hereof furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Purchaser required by the Exchange Act to be set forth
in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule
14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in the Schedule
14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and
any other available listings or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the
most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such
information and assistance (including lists of record holders or beneficial
owners of the Shares, updated from time to time upon Purchasers or its
agents request, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security
positions) as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of the
Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent  



 

5  and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
and shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
agents and Representatives to deliver) to the Company (or destroy) all copies
and any extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or
control. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives
to, cooperate with Parent and Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to
holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan or other
Benefit Plans, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the
Offer.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied, promptly after the first
time that Purchaser accepts for payment any Shares tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate, from time to
time, such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the
Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of
directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors
elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by
the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by
Parent and Purchaser (including Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer and any Top-Up Option Shares) bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. Upon Purchasers request at any time following the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall as promptly as practicable take all actions,
including filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board of Directors, increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors
(including by amending the Company Bylaws if necessary so as to increase the
size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or using its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure the resignations of such number of its incumbent
directors, in each case as is reasonably necessary to enable
Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors, and shall as promptly as practicable cause Purchasers designees to
be so elected or designated at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers
request following the Acceptance Time, also cause Persons elected or
designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the
next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each
committee of the Company Board of Directors, (ii) the board of directors of
each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Companys obligations under this _Section
1.3(a)_ shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this
Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_, including
mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and solely be responsible
for, information with  



 

6  respect to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective
officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to
and shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of
Directors on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director"
as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to
serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq
Marketplace Rules and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the
instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability
or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including
creating a committee of the Company Board of Directors) so that the
Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person
(or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no
Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three
(3) Persons who shall each qualify as an "independent director" as defined by
Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Marketplace Rules
and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto,
to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors
for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the
Company Board of Directors after the Acceptance Time and prior to the
Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the Company Board
of Directors or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the
Company Governing Documents or applicable Law) be required for the Company (i)
to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time of performance
of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser
under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights,
benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would adversely affect the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) except as provided
herein, to amend the Company Governing Documents in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action or make any other
determination of the Company Board of Directors under or in connection with
this Agreement if such action would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser). The Continuing
Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have,
the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company or the Company Board of Directors) and other advisors at the expense
of the Company as  



 

7  determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any
action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement.

and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or Information
Statement, as applicable, if and to the extent  



 

9  that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law and, the Company
further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement or Information Statement, as
applicable, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, if
any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement or
Information Statement, as applicable, as provided in _Section 1.8(b)(ii)_,
mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff).

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law:

 

(i) (A) (1) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance
Time, in consultation with Parent, duly set a record date for, call and give
notice of a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the
record date and meeting date set in consultation with Purchaser), and (2) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, convene and
hold the Special Meeting or (B) if Parent specifies that adoption of this

case of written consent, the Information Statement) to be mailed to its

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall cause to be present and vote, or cause to be voted (or, if
Parent specifies that adoption of this Agreement be effected by the written
consent of the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall consent, or cause
such consent to be given with respect to), all of the Shares then owned of
record by it, Purchaser or any of their other Subsidiaries in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and to deliver or
provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other approvals
that are required by the DGCL and any other applicable Law to effect the
Merger.

Section 1.9 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the
terms of  _Section 1.8_, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Subsidiaries shall hold, in the aggregate, at least ninety percent
(90%) of the  



 

10  outstanding Shares (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), following the
Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, Parent shall
cause the Merger to become effective promptly, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Section 1.10 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price and
the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent, Purchaser,
the Company or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing authority by Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
the Paying Agent.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities
of the Company or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the
" _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares owned
by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled
in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Offer Price,
payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_,
without interest thereon.



 

11 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent or Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration with respect to Shares converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_, Parent shall, or shall
cause Purchaser to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent
in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make
such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after
the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificate Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section
2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss together with any required indemnity) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss
together with any required indemnity) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss together with any required indemnity) or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with such
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, to be mailed as promptly as practicable following the
Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss together
with any required indemnity) or Book-Entry Share (together with such duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other required
documents), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss together with any
required indemnity) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss together with any required indemnity) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in  



 

12  accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures
in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it  



 

13  may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights (subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that
is required under applicable Tax Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable Tax Law).

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal rights of any Shares, and Purchaser
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

Section 2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price,
an aggregate number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) one (1) share less than twenty
percent (20%) of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii) the lowest
number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Common Stock then owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Subsidiaries and affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute ten
thousand (10,000) shares more than ninety percent (90%) of the Common Stock
then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect to
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise
and the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, the  



 

14  Short Form Threshold would be reached (after giving effect to the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock in
excess of the Companys total authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.
The Purchaser may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at the
Purchasers election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than
the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) executing
and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount
equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the
amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory
Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and
the Purchaser and (i) shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per
annum, (ii) shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law, order, injunction or other legal
impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or
issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise (subject to the restrictions
contained in _Section 2.4(a)_) the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in
whole or in part, only after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

(c) Each time that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser wishes to receive, and the
place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the
Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after
receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Purchaser
confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase
price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing,
Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares as specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, by
delivery of cash or a combination of cash and the Promissory Note as
contemplated by _Section 2.4(a)_, and the Company shall cause to be issued
and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the
Top-Up Option Shares or, if the Company does not then have certificated
Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-
Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by federal or state
securities Laws.

(d) Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares which
the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and the
Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, or
shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor",
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option  



 

15  Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being
and shall be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
(within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 2.5  _Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants_.

(a) Subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, the Company and the
Company Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof): (i) shall
cause, effective as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the vesting
and exercisability of each then outstanding Company Option held by any Person
then performing services as an employee, director or consultant of the
Company immediately prior to the Acceptance Time to be fully accelerated, and
(ii) shall cause, effective as of the Acceptance Time, each then outstanding
Company Option, without regard to the identity of the holder, to be cancelled
and terminated as of the Acceptance Time (if not exercised prior to the
Acceptance Time) and the holder thereof to become entitled to receive an
amount of cash, if any, from the Company equal to the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per Share of such
Company Option, and (B) the number of Shares subject to the exercisable
portion of such Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(b) Subject to the consummation of the Merger, each Company Warrant which has
been issued by the Company and is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether
or not then exercisable and without regard to the identity of the holder, (i)
shall be exchanged for, and the holder of such Company Warrant shall be
entitled to receive, upon surrender of such holders Company Warrants to
the Company for cancellation, or (ii) shall become exercisable for, and the
holder of such Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive upon such exercise
and surrender of the Company Warrant for cancellation, cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share of such Company Warrant and (ii) the number of Shares
subject to the exercisable portion of such Company Warrant (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). The Warrant
Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable following the later of the Effective Time or such exercise and
surrender of such Company Warrant. 

(c) The Company shall take all corporate or other actions necessary to
effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and the Company Warrants as
contemplated by this _Section 2.5 _and to ensure that (i) all awards issued
under the Company Stock Plan shall be settled as of the Effective Time, and
(ii) neither any holder of Company Options and Company Warrants, nor any
other participant in any Company Stock Plan, shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under the Company Stock Plan, except as provided in this _Section
2.5_.



 

16 (d) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall, after consultation with Parent, deliver to the holders of Company
Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan and this Agreement. As soon as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, after consultation with
Parent, deliver to the holders of Company Warrants appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights pursuant to the applicable warrant and this
Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Additional Benefits and Warrant Matters_. The Company shall take
all necessary actions, including obtaining any required consents from all
holders of outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants, that are
necessary to effect the transactions described in _Section 2.5_ above
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and agreements
evidencing the Company Options and the Company Warrants. All amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ shall be paid without interest. Any payments made
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes
that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold from such payments
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any
provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(a) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite

operate its respective properties and assets and to conduct its business as
now being conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to
be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
to or made available to Parent and Purchaser prior to the execution of this
Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to the Company Governing
Documents not filed as of the date hereof with the SEC. The Company is in
compliance with the terms of the Company Governing Documents. The Company has

in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of
all meetings of the stockholders of the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries, the Company Board of Directors and the board of directors of
each of the Company Subsidiaries and the committees of each of such boards of
directors, in each case held since January 1, 2007 and prior to the date
hereof except in each case such minutes and draft minutes relating to any
Competing Proposals made prior to the date hereof, this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(b) _Subsidiaries_. All Company Subsidiaries are set forth on  _Schedule

shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "),
and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, all of which are designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the
" _Preferred Stock_ "). As of May 18, 2009, (A) 20,791,368 shares of Common

issuance upon exercise of the Company Options, and (E) 378,943 shares of
Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Company Warrants. All
of the outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock are, and all Shares
which may be issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Company Options
and Company Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the terms
thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other  



 

18  indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote (or convertible into securities having such
rights) (" _Voting Debt_ ") of the Company issued and outstanding. Except for
the Company Options and the Company Warrants described in the second sentence
of this _Section 3.2(a)_, there are no (x) options, warrants, calls, pre-
emptive rights, subscriptions, equity or equity-based compensation awards,
whether granted under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind, including any stockholder
rights plan, relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company,
obligating the Company to issue, transfer or sell or cause to be issued,
transferred or sold any shares of capital stock or Voting Debt of, or other
equity or equity-based interest in, the Company or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such shares or equity or equity-based interests, or
obligating the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, subscription, equity or equity-based compensation awards,
whether granted under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, or other right,
agreement, arrangement or commitment (collectively and together with capital
stock, " _Equity Interests_ ") or (y) outstanding contractual obligations of
the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or any
capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company or to provide

thereby, the exercise price, regular vesting schedule and expiration date
applicable thereto and, except for such differences, no stock option agreement
or other award agreement contains material terms that are inconsistent with,
or in addition to, such forms. Each grant of Company Options was
duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company
Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all
necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company
Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof)
and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or
written consents; such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act
and all other applicable Laws, including the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules; and the
per share exercise price of such grant was equal to or greater than the fair
market value (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in the case of
each Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option", and
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in the case of each other
Company Option) of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date. Each
Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code, if any, so qualifies. Each Company Option may, by its
terms, be treated at the Effective Time as set forth in  _Section 2.5(a)_.
All outstanding  



 

19  Company Warrants have been granted pursuant to the warrant agreements
identified on _Schedule 3.2(b)_, true and complete copies of which have

Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver

and the filing of the Certificate of Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Purchaser, is a
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited

Company Agreement, or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree or Law

5.2(b)), or (vii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any
act set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) above, a " _Change of Recommendation_
"). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_
by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and direct its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives to, (A) 



 

43  immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or

Competing Proposal and (B) promptly after the date hereof request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
such Person(s) within the last 12 months for the purpose of evaluating a
possible Competing Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, a bona fide written Competing
Proposal that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
by such party, and which Competing Proposal did not otherwise result from a
breach of _Section 5.2(a)_, the Company may, subject to compliance with
_Section 5.2(d)_, take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party a
customary executed confidentiality agreement (which need not restrict such
Person from making an unsolicited Competing Proposal) not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions
or negotiations with the third party making such Competing Proposal with
respect to the Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall (A) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company taking
such actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, provide written
notice to Parent of such Competing Proposal or the determination of the
Company Board of Directors as provided above, as applicable, and (B) provide
to Parent any information concerning the Company provided to such third party
which was not previously provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person.

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, the
Company Board of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation prior to the
Acceptance Time if the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors
that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the exercise of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Change of Recommendation (and no termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(e)_) may be made until after the fourth (4th) business day
following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Change of
Recommendation/Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that
the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board of Directors (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation/Superior Proposal and a new four (4) business day
period). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation, (i) the
Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of  



 

44  Change of Recommendation/Superior Proposal or otherwise and (ii) the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c) of this _Section 5.2_, the Company shall promptly (within 48
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Competing Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or inquiry
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such
Competing Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any such Competing Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as
practicable (within 48 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof, with copies
of all draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent
such material contains terms and conditions relating to any Competing
Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
their Representatives) in connection with any such Competing Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Company Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided,_ that in no event shall the
Company or the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or
agree to take, any other action prohibited by _Section 5.2(a) _(it being
understood that any accurate disclosure of factual information required to be
made under applicable Law shall not be considered a modification prohibited
by  _Section 5.2(a)_).

Section 5.3 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the
Company shall: (i) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns that are due on or
before the Closing in accordance with past practice, (ii) pay all Taxes due
and payable in respect of such Tax Returns, (iii) accrue a reserve in its
books and financial statements at such times and in such amounts as are in
accordance with past practice for all Taxes payable by the Company for which
no Tax Return is due prior to the Closing, and (iv) promptly notify Parent of
any suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding, or audit (collectively, "
_Tax Actions_ ") that is or becomes pending against or with respect to the
Company.

(b) For purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 1445 of the Code,
the Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a properly
executed statement that the Company is not a "United States real property
holding company" (within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code).

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent about any material Tax matter
involving any Company Subsidiary, and the Company shall not take any action
in  



 

45  respect of such Tax matter without Parents consent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld).

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Purchaser and Parent and Purchaser shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate as if made as of any time prior to the Effective Time, such
that the conditions set forth in paragraph (iii) of _Annex I_ would not be
satisfied or that would give rise to a right of termination set forth in 
_Section 8.1(b)_, as the case may be, and (ii) any failure of the Company,
Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, or any Representative thereof, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or
the representations or warranties of the parties, or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto. Furthermore, the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (and in each case promptly furnish copies to the

portions of such notices or communications that include confidential
information not directly related to the Transactions, and (ii) any actions,

reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company Agreements,
contracts, books, records, analysis, projections, plans, systems, personnel,
commitments, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information provided to Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Company shall not be required to provide access to, or to disclose
information, where such access or disclosure would (a) jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the Company (provided that the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to  



 

46  allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege) or (b) contravene any applicable Law
or contractual restriction.

Section 6.3 _Consents and Approvals_.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its commercially

execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, (iii) make or cause to be made the applications or filings
required to be made by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of their

reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR

with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such application or filing. If a
party hereto intends to independently participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry, then such party shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of
such meeting. The parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,

party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to any such application or filing.

respective Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
third-party consents necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity challenging
the Transactions as violative of any applicable Law, each of the Company and

contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any action or
proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction
that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
consummation of the Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the

counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market
to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such
party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment
upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide any
such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence
of a Competing Proposal and matters related thereto or a Change of
Recommendation;  _provided_ , _further_ , each party hereto and their
respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.4_. The Company
shall provide a meaningful opportunity to Parent to review and comment upon
all formal Company employee communication  



 

48  programs or announcements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations of
the Company to the fullest extent permissible under applicable provisions of

the individuals who serve as directors, officers and employees of the Company
entitled to be indemnified under the Indemnification Agreements (the "

incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain

Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons that survive
the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

(c) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail")
directors and officers liability insurance policy from a reputable

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the Effective
Time, covering each Person currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policies on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies, taken
together, as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that unless
the Company makes available to Parent a complete and accurate copy of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement no later than the date that
is ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parents
obligation under this  _Section 6.5(c)_ shall be to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such "tail" policy at the Effective Time or as
promptly thereafter as practicable; _provided_ , _further, however_ , that in
satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.5(c)_, Parent shall in no
event be obligated to pay more than $750,000 in the aggregate to obtain such
coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot
be obtained for $750,000 or less in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated
to obtain a prepaid policy providing such coverage as may be obtained for such
$750,000 aggregate amount.

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or  



 

49  (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.5_.

(e) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_, and this  _Section 6.5_ shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including
their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered
Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby. 

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price" or other anti-takeover Laws enacted under state or federal Laws
becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Offer, the
acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or any other
Transaction, then the Company Board of Directors shall take all action
necessary to render such statute inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.7 _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_. Effective as of the Effective Time
and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the
Company who continues to be employed by the Company or the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (the " _Affected Employees_
"), (a) a base salary or regular hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is
not less than the base salary or regular hourly wage provided to such Affected
Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (b)
employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to
those provided to such Affected Employee (including all dependents) by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have
any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity
or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any
such plans or arrangements; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that no plans or
arrangements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary providing for such
issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits
are substantially comparable in the aggregate. Effective as of the Effective
Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, that periods of employment with the Company (including
any current or former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the
Company) shall be taken into account (i) for purposes of vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under Parents defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for
purposes of eligibility for vacation under Parents vacation program, (iii)
for purposes of eligibility and  



 

50  participation under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other
than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan) and
Parents 401(k) plan and (iv) unless covered under another arrangement with
or of the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under Parents severance plan
(in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the
extent that Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the
Surviving Corporation and not in any case where credit would result in
duplication of benefits), but not for purposes of any other employee benefit
plan of Parent. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) reduce any period of
limitation on health benefits coverage of Affected Employees due to pre-
existing conditions (or actively at work or similar) under the applicable
health benefits plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent by the number of days
of an individuals "creditable coverage," to the extent required by Section
701 of ERISA, (ii) waive any and all eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements with respect to such Affected Employees to the
extent such eligibility waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements were waived with respect to the Affected Employees under
the Benefits Plans and (iii) credit each Affected Employee with all
deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee
under the health benefit plans of the Company or its affiliates prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year.
The Offer shall not affect any Affected Employees accrual of, or right to
take, any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to
such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in
this Agreement shall confer upon any Affected Employee any right to continue
in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate
of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Affected Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any
affiliate of Parent and the Affected Employee.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings. Furthermore, no provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans,
programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing therein shall be construed as
an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or
understanding for any purpose.

Section 6.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the  



 

51  Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.10 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board of
Directors) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of its officers,
directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

Section 6.12 _Tender and Support Agreement_. The Company has delivered to
Purchaser, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Tender and
Support Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
 whereby Alan H. Auerbach, Arie S. Belldegrun and Horizon BioMedical
Ventures, LLC agree to tender each of their Shares in the Offer. Such Tender
and Support Agreements shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

CONDITIONS

Section 7.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligations to Effect the Merger_.
The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be

by Parent, Purchaser and the Company, as the case may be, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law:

(a) _Stockholder Approval_. To the extent required by the DGCL and the Nasdaq
Marketplace Rules, this Agreement shall have been adopted and the Merger
approved by the Requisite Stockholder Approval;

by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction which prohibits the

preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (collectively, " _Restraints_ ") in effect preventing
the consummation of the Merger;



 

52 (c) _Purchase of Shares in Offer_. Purchaser shall have accepted for payment,

terminated in accordance with its terms.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned only as follows:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent, Purchaser and the Company at any time;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, if there
has been a breach or failure to perform by the other party of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) in the case of the Company
shall result in any of the conditions in _Annex I_ not being satisfied and
(ii) in the case of a breach by Parent or Purchaser, that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, or materially impair or delay, the ability of either
Parent or Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (and in each case
such breach is not curable, or if curable, has not been cured within twenty
(20) business days after the receipt of notice thereof by the defaulting party
from the non-defaulting party); _provided_ ,  _however_ , this Agreement may
not be terminated pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ by any party if such
party is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred by midnight, New York City time on the Outside Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, Purchasers failure to
accept for payment all such Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer prior to the
Outside Date;

(d) by Parent, in the event that prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company
Board of Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation or (ii) the
Company Board of Directors fails publicly to reaffirm its recommendation of
this Agreement or the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, (x)
within ten (10) business days of receipt of a written request by Parent to
provide such reaffirmation following a Competing Proposal (which
reaffirmation request may be made by Parent only once with respect to each
Competing Proposal or any amendment to the financial  



 

53  terms or any other material term of such Competing Proposal) or (y) if the
Outside Date is less then ten (10) business days from the receipt of such
request by Parent, by the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding the Outside Date;

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
Board of Directors determines to accept a Superior Proposal, but only if the
Company has complied in all material respects with the provisions of _Section
5.2(c)_ and  _Section 5.2(d)_; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_, and any
purported termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless (A) concurrently with such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal and (B) the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to 
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_;

(f) by either the Company or Parent if any Restraint having the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions shall be in effect and shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ shall have complied with its
obligations under _Section 6.3_ to prevent the entry of and to remove such
order, decree or ruling.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in 
_Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 3.24_, _Section
8.2_ and _Section 9.3_ through _Section 9.14_ shall survive
such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Section 8.2(d)_,
nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for a deliberate
and material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)_ or (2) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or
(B)(1) prior to the Acceptance Time, a Competing Proposal shall have been made
directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise
become publicly known or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a
Competing Proposal, (2) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c) _and (3) on or prior to
the twelve (12) month anniversary of such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal or the
transactions contemplated thereby are actually consummated, then the Company
shall pay to Parent a fee of Thirty Five Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand  



 

54  Dollars ($35,150,000.00) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") on the first business
day following (x) in the case of a payment required by clause (A) above, the
date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment
required by clause (B) above, the date of the first to occur of the events
referred to in clause (B)(3) (unless the events referred to in clause (B)(3)
occurred prior to any termination referred to in clause (B)(2), in which case,
the Termination Fee shall be payable on the date of such termination) and, in
each case, upon the payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
contemplated hereby to Parent or Purchaser.

(ii) For purposes of _Section 8.2(b)(i)(B)(3)_ only, the term "Competing
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 9.5_,
except that the reference to "20%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal"
shall be deemed to be a reference to "40%".

(c) The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
any termination fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made, and (ii) the Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and the Purchaser, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parents right to receive payment of the
Termination Fee from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and the Purchaser against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Time or any vote or consent of stockholders of the Company contemplated
hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto (by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors, if required); _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made which decreases the
Merger Consideration and, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders

the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no waiver

without obtaining such further approval. Any agreement on the part of a party
or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This _Section 9.2_ shall not limit any covenant

Effects shall be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect:

(A) the withdrawal or termination of an investigational new drug application
for the Key Product for the treatment of chemo-refractory or chemo-naive
castrate resistant prostate cancer prior to submission of a new drug
application for the Key Product, and/or an equivalent action under the Laws

prior to completion based on matters relating to the efficacy or safety of
the Key Product in the treatment of chemo-refractory or chemo-naive castrate

suspension of any Phase III clinical trial for the Key Product prior to
completion based on matters relating to the efficacy or safety of the Key
Product in the treatment of chemo-refractory or chemo-naive castrate resistant
prostate cancer, which suspension would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Company from obtaining approval from the FDA or EMEA to market the Key
Product for the treatment of chemo-refractory or chemo-naive castrate
resistant prostate cancer in the United States or European Union;

(D) any unexpected drug-related, serious adverse event or events in patients
who received the Key Product in a clinical trial or other patient

59  refractory or chemo-naive castrate resistant prostate cancer in the United
States or European Union; or

(E) any failure to adhere to the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, the regulations and guidance documents of the FDA promulgated
thereunder, the equivalent Laws of the EMEA and its Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use, or the European Union member states, or any Company
Permit (including the failure to possess or maintain the validity of any
Company Permit), relating to the investigational use and clinical trials of
the Key Product or with respect to the making of untrue or fraudulent
statements or the disclosure of information, or any failure to adhere to
clinical protocols or informed consent requirements, in any such case which,
individually or in the aggregate, (x) would reasonably be expected to prevent
the Company from obtaining approval from the FDA or EMEA to market the Key
Product for the treatment of chemo-refractory or chemo-naive castrate
resistant prostate cancer in the United States or European Union or (y) would
be reasonably likely to delay such approval to such an extent that the delay

reasons therefor) would have a material adverse effect on the aggregate
financial value to be derived by the Company from the Key Product.

Stock granted or awarded under the Company Stock Plan.

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.
