Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare (at Buyer's
expense) and deliver to Seller a worksheet setting forth Buyer's good faith
computation of the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, which
computation shall be prepared in the same format and on the same basis used to
prepare the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount as set forth on
Exhibit A, together with documentation that supports Buyer\'s determinations
and calculations. If within forty-five (45) days following delivery of such
worksheet and supporting documentation to Seller, Seller does not object in
writing thereto to Buyer, then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount shall constitute the actual amount of the Aggregate Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement (the "Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount"). If, within forty-five (45) days following
delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation to Seller, Seller
objects in writing thereto to Buyer (describing in reasonable detail the
specific line items and values that are in dispute and the reasons for such
dispute, and proposing alternative values with respect to such specific line
items) such Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital 

 





\- 24 -



Amount shall be subject to the objection and resolution provisions set forth
in Section 2.4(e) below.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is not prepared and
delivered by Buyer within the sixty (60) day period set forth in Section
2.4(b) above, Seller shall be entitled (but not obligated) during the forty-
five (45) day period commencing on the sixty-first (61st) day after the
Closing Date to prepare (at Seller's expense) and deliver to Buyer a worksheet
setting forth Seller's good faith computation of the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount, which computation shall be prepared in the same format
and on the same basis used to prepare the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital
Amount as set forth on Exhibit A, and based upon information available to
Seller, and accompanied by the documentation that supports Seller's
determinations and calculations. If within forty-five (45) days following
delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation to Buyer, Buyer does
not object in writing thereto to Seller, then the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount submitted by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.4(c)
shall constitute the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If, within
forty-five (45) days following delivery of such worksheet and supporting
documentation to Buyer, Buyer objects in writing thereto to Seller (describing
in reasonable detail the specific line items and values that are in dispute
and the reasons for such dispute, and proposing alternative values with
respect to such specific line items), such Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount shall be subject to the objection and resolution provisions set
forth in Section 2.4(e) below. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If neither Buyer nor Seller prepare and deliver a Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c),
above, the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount delivered at Closing
shall become the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for all purposes
hereunder. 

|

(e)

|

If Seller objects to Buyer's Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or if Buyer objects to Seller's Proposed Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(c), then Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve the particular items and
values that are identified in the applicable written notice of objection over
a twenty (20) day period commencing on delivery of written notice of objection
pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c), as the case may be. Should such
negotiations not result in an agreement as to the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount within such twenty (20) day period (or such longer period as
Buyer and Seller may agree in writing), then either Party may, within ten (10)
days following the expiration of such twenty (20) day period, submit such
remaining disputed items and values to the Neutral Auditor. If neither Party
submits such remaining disputed items and values to the Neutral Auditor in
accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount prepared by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c) shall become the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for all purposes hereunder. Each Party
agrees to promptly execute a reasonable engagement letter, if requested to do
so by the Neutral Auditor. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the Neutral Auditor. The 

 



\- 25 -



Neutral Auditor, acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall resolve such
disputed items and determine the values to be ascribed thereto, and using
those values (together with other items not in dispute) determine the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount only (prepared on the same basis used to
prepare the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount as set forth on
Exhibit A). The Neutral Auditor shall only decide the specific disputed items
and the values ascribed thereto and using those values (together with the
other items included in the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount) determine the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, and the
Neutral Auditor's decision with respect to such disputed items and values must
be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the applicable
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and the written notice of
objection, respectively. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve such
disputes, determine such values and calculate the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount (in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) within
thirty (30) days after being retained as provided in this Section 2.4(e). All
fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Auditor will be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall
be directed to resolve the disputed items and amounts and deliver to Buyer and
Seller a written determination of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount (such determination to be made consistent with this Section 2.4(e), to
include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving
at such determination, and to be based solely on information provided to the
Neutral Auditor by Buyer or Seller) within thirty (30) days after being
retained, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the
Parties and their respective Affiliates, and their respective Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this Section 2.4(e) shall be the exclusive mechanism
for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the Aggregate Net Working Capital.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The "Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount" shall be
calculated by computing the Closing Date Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 2.4(a) but substituting the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. The "Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount" shall be the amount (positive or negative) equal to (i) the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus (ii) the Closing Date
Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then Buyer shall
pay in cash to Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then Seller shall pay in cash to Buyer
the amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Any such net excess or deficit payment in
respect of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount will be due and
payable within fifteen (15) days after the date that the Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount is finally determined as provided in this Section 2.4
and will be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as shall be specified by Buyer or Seller, as applicable at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the payment date. Any payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.4(f) shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties, unless otherwise required by Law.

Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other
and, if applicable, the Neutral Auditor, and their respective Representatives,
reasonable assistance and access to such books, records and employees
(including those of the Acquired Companies) to the extent they relate to the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as are reasonably
requested in connection with the matters addressed in this Section 2.4.
Consistent with the foregoing, Buyer shall, at its expense, provide to Seller
or the Neutral Auditor, or provide reasonable access (in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to its business) to Seller or the Neutral Auditor to
review, the books and records, documents and work papers to the extent related
to the preparation of the worksheet and computation of the Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount. Seller and the Neutral Auditor shall be entitled to
make reasonable inquiries and information requests of Buyer regarding the
worksheet setting forth the computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount and the calculations set forth therein.

immediately available funds to such account or accounts as shall be specified
by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the

(a)

|

During the Interim Period, Seller will provide, and will cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access,
upon reasonable prior written notice (but in no event less than five (5)
Business Days' prior written notice) and during normal business hours, to the
properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies and the appropriate
officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates who have significant
responsibility for one or more Acquired Companies, but only to the extent that
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business of Seller and
its Affiliates or the Businesses of the Acquired Companies, that such access
is reasonably related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents, and subject to compliance with Seller's and its
applicable Affiliates' safety and security policies, protocols and
requirements and all Laws and Contracts or Permits to which Seller, the
Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates are a party (provided that,
where the furnishing of such access would cause Seller, the Acquired Companies
or any of their Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation, Seller
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have such confidentiality
obligations waived with respect to Buyer and its Representatives); provided,
however, that Seller shall have the right (i) to have a Representative of
Seller present for any permitted Buyer communication with employees or
officers of Seller or its Affiliates and (ii) to impose reasonable
restrictions and requirements for safety purposes. Buyer shall be entitled, at
its sole cost and expense, to have the Property surveyed and to conduct non-
invasive physical inspections; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
entitled to collect any air, soil, surface water or ground water samples nor
to perform any invasive or destructive environmental or subsurface
investigation, including any "Phase II" environmental site assessment or
similar work on the Property. Promptly upon completion of any such entry,
Buyer shall repair any damage caused by such entry. Any disclosure to Buyer
pursuant to the foregoing shall be subject to such disclosure (w) not
violating any Laws, (x) not resulting in the waiver of any solicitor-client,
work product or similar privilege, (y) not being of confidential information
concerning the activities of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) that is unrelated to the Acquired Companies, the Business of any
Acquired Company or the Projects, or that contains Confidential Information
relating to Affiliate services to be terminated or severed pursuant to Section
6.8 (including Excluded Contracts) (provided that, 

 



\- 49 -



such Confidential Information may be provided to Buyer pursuant to a mutually
acceptable non-disclosure agreement containing appropriate restrictions and
protections) or (z) not being of proprietary models of Seller or any of its
Affiliates pertaining to energy project evaluation, energy, solar power, wind
power or other fuel price curves or projections or other economic predictive
models.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

During the Interim Period, in no event shall Buyer or any of Buyer's
Affiliates hold any meetings with, or otherwise communicate with, any
suppliers, other vendors or customers of any Acquired Company, or any
Representatives of any Governmental Authority, regarding any Projects or
Acquired Companies without the prior consent of Seller (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At any such meeting
consented to by Seller, a Representative of Seller shall be entitled to
participate therein, provided that the failure of such Representative of
Seller to attend such meeting shall not prevent its occurrence. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives for any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses incurred by Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives, or by any of Buyer's Representatives for any injuries or
property damage arising out of the access and other rights under this Section

At or promptly after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all books of
account and corporate records, including minute books and Tax Returns, tax
records, financial and other books and records of the Acquired Companies or

foregoing items that relate to Excluded Contracts and Excluded Items) to the
extent such information is not in the custody or possession of the Acquired
Companies on the Closing Date other than (i) information relating to pre-
Closing periods in respect of any Non-Acquired Company Affiliate that is
commercially sensitive, trade secret or otherwise confidential, (ii) in the
case of claims between the Parties, any information that is subject to any
solicitor-client, work product or other privilege or that otherwise would not
be required to be provided pursuant to a subpoena or other civil discovery
procedure or (iii) books and records that Seller determines cannot practicably
be delivered to Buyer, in which case Seller will retain such books and records
for seven (7) years following the Closing Date and provide Buyer with
reasonable access, upon reasonable prior written notice (but in no event less
than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice) and during normal business
hours, to such books and records. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to permit Buyer or any of their agents, employees or representatives to have
access to any files, records, contracts or documents of Seller or any Acquired
Company relating to the sale of the Purchased Shares or the Projects,
including any bids or offers received by Seller or any Affiliates of Seller
for the sale of the Purchased Shares or the Projects, it being agreed that all
such bids or offers shall be the sole property of Seller. 

6.4 Certain Restrictions. Except as required or permitted hereby, or as
otherwise set forth in Schedule 6.4, during the Interim Period, Seller will
cause the Acquired Companies and the Projects to operate in the ordinary
course of business (including causing the Acquired Companies to complete, and
cause to be completed, all scheduled or planned maintenance with





\- 50 -

and to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to preserve their relationships
with all Persons having dealings with them. Without limiting the foregoing,
except as otherwise set forth in Schedule 6.4, required or permitted hereby or
required by Laws or any Material Contract or as consented to by Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (except
that this Section 6.4 shall not apply to Permitted Transactions or services
terminated pursuant to Section 6.8 and no consent of Buyer will be required
with respect to any matter set forth in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent would reasonably
be expected to violate any Law), Seller will, during the Interim Period, cause

consistent with past practice and will not be considered to be a reduction of

that is reasonably acceptable to Seller, that Buyer has made all filings
required pursuant to paragraph (a) above with, and has provided notice to, all
applicable Governmental Authorities and all applicable counterparties to the
Material Contracts regarding the sale of the Acquired Companies and the
Purchased Assets to Buyer and the new addresses for notice purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

In the event that Buyer breaches this Section 6.5, Seller shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Section 6.5 and to injunctive relief against
further violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in equity
available to Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

6.6

|

Support Obligations. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Buyer acknowledges that certain of the Non-Acquired Company Affiliates (each,
a "Support Provider") have provided credit support to or on behalf of certain
Acquired Companies pursuant to certain credit support obligations as set forth
on Schedule 6.6. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

At or prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the Collateral Account Guarantees
to be released and returned to the applicable Support Provider, and such
accounts to which the Collateral Account Guarantees relate shall, to the
extent required by the Project Financing Documents or other agreements
pursuant to which the Collateral Account Guarantees were provided, be funded
by Buyer with cash, a surety bond, a guaranty or a letter of credit in
accordance with the terms of the Project Financing Documents or the other
agreements pursuant to which the Collateral Account Guarantees were provided. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

At or prior to Closing, with respect to the Support Obligations, each of the
Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect the full and
unconditional release, effective as of the Closing Date, of the Support
Providers from such Support Obligations or the return or cancellation of any
letter of credit, surety bond, guaranty or other credit support. For purposes
of this subsection, in the case of Buyer, such Commercially Reasonable Efforts
include: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

furnishing a letter of credit, from a lending institution that has a Credit
Rating at least equal to the lending institution for such existing letter of
credit, to replace each existing letter of credit that is a Support Obligation 

 



\- 53 -



containing terms and conditions that are substantially the same to the terms
and conditions of such existing letter of credit;

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

providing a Buyer guaranty (or Buyer Affiliate guaranty) to replace each
existing guaranty that is a Support Obligation containing terms at least equal
to the terms of such existing guaranty (other than with respect to the credit
rating of the guarantor), provided that if the beneficiary of any existing
guaranty does not accept such a replacement guaranty (effective as of the
Closing) (A) and the terms of such existing guaranty or of any Contract or Law
requiring such existing guaranty to be maintained permit the replacement of
such existing guaranty with another form of credit support, Buyer shall offer
the beneficiary of such existing guaranty such other form of credit support in
order to obtain the release of such existing guaranty or (B) if the terms of
such existing guaranty or of any such Contract or Law requiring such existing
guaranty to be maintained do not so permit the replacement of such existing
guaranty, Buyer shall offer to replace such existing guaranty with a letter of
credit or cash in an amount up to the amount of such existing guaranty in
substitution therefor; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

replacing any other existing security agreement or arrangement on
substantially the same terms and conditions to such existing security
agreement or arrangement that is a Support Obligation. 

In each case, (x) any breach or default under a Material Contract occurring
solely as a result of Buyer's failure to procure or provide any such credit
support instruments on or prior to the Closing shall not constitute a breach
of any of Seller's representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or
Article 4 and (y) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.6(c), Buyer shall ensure any credit support provided pursuant to this
Section 6.6(c) satisfies all of the credit support provisions of the
applicable Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically
acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that Seller shall not be obligated to
incur, pay, reimburse or provide, or cause any of its Affiliates to incur,
pay, reimburse or provide, any liability, compensation, consideration or
charge in order to replace the Support Obligations.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

During the Interim Period, Buyer shall have the right to contact and have
discussions with each beneficiary of a Support Obligation in order to satisfy
its obligations under this Section 6.6; provided, however, that (i) Buyer
shall give Seller not less than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice
before making any such contact and (ii) Seller shall have the right to have
Seller's Representatives present via telephone or in person, as applicable,
during any such contact or discussion, provided that Seller's Representatives'
failure to be present shall not prevent Buyer from contacting and having
discussions with such beneficiaries of the Support Obligations. Seller shall
provide to Buyer all information in the possession of Seller and its
Affiliates reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the obligations of
Buyer under this Section 6.6. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Prior to the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
effect any amendments or modifications or any changes to the Contracts or
obligations to which any Support Obligations relate. If, at any time after the
Effective Date, any credit support obligation required to be provided to or on
behalf of the Acquired 

 

\- 54 -



Companies under the terms of any Material Contract or Law, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith in
determining the amount and form of credit support obligations and in no event
shall Seller provide, or permit its Affiliates to provide, any credit support
obligation in an amount greater than the minimum amount required without
Buyer's consent.

6.7 Excluded Items. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchased Assets shall exclude those
items listed on Schedule 6.7 (the "Excluded Items"). Seller shall retain all
benefits, liabilities and obligations with respect to the Excluded Items, and
Seller shall, at Seller's sole cost and expense, prior to the Closing Date,
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) other than in respect of any
Excluded Item that will automatically terminate with effect at the Closing,
cause the Acquired Companies to distribute, transfer or assign each Excluded
Item to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate, (ii) other than in respect
of any Excluded Item that will automatically terminate with effect at the
Closing, assume, or cause a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate to assume, all
liabilities and obligations under, in respect of or relating to, Excluded
Items and (iii) cause the Acquired Companies to be fully released and
discharged from all liabilities and obligations under or in respect of
Excluded Items, in each case on terms satisfactory to Buyer acting reasonably.
Buyer acknowledges that the inability of Seller to have any Excluded Item
distributed, transferred or assigned from any Acquired Company for any reason
shall not delay Closing and any Excluded Item that Seller is unable to so
distribute, transfer or assign by the Closing shall be referred to as a "Non-
Transferred Excluded Item". After the Closing Date with respect to each Non-
Transferred Excluded Item, (a) Buyer shall, at Seller's sole cost and expense,
permit Seller to exclusively direct and manage each Acquired Company's
participation in all negotiations, arbitrations, litigation, claims,
bankruptcy or other proceedings solely to the extent involving such Non-
Transferred Excluded Item, whether existing on the Closing Date or arising
thereafter, provided that any such action that could adversely affect Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall require Buyer's
prior consent, and (b) Seller shall pay, discharge and perform, or cause to be
paid, discharged or performed, at Seller's sole cost and expense, all
liabilities and obligations under, in respect of or relating to Non-
Transferred Excluded Items. Promptly upon request of Buyer, Seller shall
reimburse Buyer and the Acquired Companies for all costs and expenses incurred
or payable in connection with the foregoing. Buyer shall also permit Seller to
settle on behalf of any Acquired Company any Non-Transferred Excluded Item in
Seller's sole discretion, and shall promptly pay Seller the after-Tax amount
of any proceeds or recoveries received in connection with any Non-Transferred
Excluded Item net of any costs and expenses of the Acquired Companies. Buyer
shall, at Seller's expense, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide any
relevant books, records or other information concerning any Non-Transferred
Excluded Item and reasonable access to each Project site in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to its business where any Non-Transferred Excluded
Item is located, as reasonably requested by Seller, in connection with any
Non-Transferred Excluded Item; provided, in each case, that Buyer shall have
no obligation to make available information or access without reasonable prior
notice, during normal business hours and subject to compliance with normal
security and safety rules applicable to the applicable Property.

6.8 Termination of Certain Services, Excluded Contracts and Other Affiliate
Transactions.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Seller, to (a)
terminate, sever or assign to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate
effective immediately prior to or concurrently with the Closing the insurance
policies referred to in Section 6.9(a); and (b) effective immediately prior to
or concurrently with the Closing, terminate or assign to Seller or a Non-
Acquired Company Affiliate, and cause each Acquired Company to be fully
released and discharged from all



\- 55 -



liabilities and obligations under, each Excluded Contract, in each case
without any liability (including Taxes) of any kind on the part of any
Acquired Company arising from any such termination, severance, assignment or
otherwise, and in each case on terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer,
acting reasonably. In addition to the foregoing, prior to the Closing, any
liability of an Acquired Company to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company
Affiliate, or any receivable from an Acquired Company to Seller or a Non-
Acquired Company Affiliate, shall be satisfied or otherwise eliminated in
full, except for any outstanding invoices that are payable by an Acquired
Company in the ordinary course of business and that are included in the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount.

| 
---|--- 

6.9

|

Insurance. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect
insurance coverage consistent with past practice for the Acquired Companies
until the Closing. From and after the Closing, all such insurance coverage for
the Acquired Companies and the Purchased Assets shall no longer be provided or
maintained for any of the Acquired Companies or such Purchased Assets by
Seller. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing insurance to the
Acquired Companies for any loss occuring after the Closing. If any claims are
actually made prior to the Closing Date under any liability insurance policy
for any of the Acquired Companies, then Seller shall cause the applicable
Acquired Company to file, give notice and otherwise continue to pursue such
claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies (but only to the
extent such policies otherwise permit such recovery following termination
thereof), and Seller will pay over to the applicable Acquired Company any
after-Tax amount of proceeds of any insurance recovery under any such policy
by Seller and Seller shall remain responsible for any deductible or self-
insured retention obligations related thereto. If any casualty loss occurs
prior to the Closing that is insured under any property or casualty insurance
policy for any of the Acquired Companies and claims associated with such
losses, are made after the Closing, then Seller shall cause the applicable
Acquired Company to file, give notice and otherwise continue to pursue such
claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies (but only to the
extent such policies otherwise permit such recovery following termination
thereof), and Seller will pay over to the applicable Acquired Company any such
after-Tax amount of proceeds of any insurance recovery under any such policy
by Seller, other than any such after-Tax amount of proceeds that have been or
will be applied to repair or replace the property and Seller shall remain
responsible for any deductible or self-insured retention obligations related
to such claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Buyer shall (i) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain Replacement
Insurance that complies with all of the requirements set forth in the Material
Contracts (including the Project Financing Agreements) and will be effective
as of the Closing Date and (ii) provide reasonable evidence to Seller of such
Replacement Insurance, in each case, on or prior to the date that is five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with and
assist Buyer in connection with the obtainment of such Replacement Insurance. 

| 
---|--- 

6.10

|

Casualty. 

 





\- 56 -



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If any of the Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed by casualty loss
during the Interim Period, then the Seller shall promptly, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of such casualty loss, engage an Independent
Architect (and, if the Seller does not so engage an Independent Architect,
then Buyer may engage an Independent Architect) to prepare a report as to the
Restoration Costs and rated capacities of such Purchased Assets (an
"Independent Casualty Report"). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Subject to Section 6.10(c), if any of the Purchased Assets are damaged or
destroyed during the Interim Period, then Seller, in its sole discretion,
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the applicable Independent
Casualty Reports, shall elect by written notice to Buyer to either (i) at its
sole cost and expense, complete, or cause to be completed, the restoration,
repair or replacement of such Purchased Assets to a condition reasonably
comparable to their prior condition or (ii) reduce the amount of the Purchase
Price by the aggregate Restoration Cost in respect of such Purchased Assets.
Subject to Section 6.10(c), if Seller elects to restore, repair or replace
such damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets, then the Seller shall restore,
repair or replaced such damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets prior to Closing
and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably
necessary to complete such restoration, repair or replacement (provided that,
in no circumstance shall the Outside Date be extended unless consented to in
writing by the Buyer). Subject to Section 9.1(c), such casualty loss shall not
affect the Closing, except with respect to the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Notwithstanding Section 6.10(b), if (i) the aggregate Restoration Cost in
respect of all damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets is more than an amount
equal to $20,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) any damage or destruction of the
Purchased Assets prevents the generation of electricity by or from Purchased
Assets having rated capacities of 10 megawatts or more in the aggregate, in
each case as set forth in the Independent Casualty Reports, then Buyer, in its
sole discretion, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the applicable
Independent Casualty Reports, may elect by written notice to Seller to either
(i) require Seller, at its sole cost and expense, to restore, repair or
replace such damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets to a condition reasonably
comparable to their prior condition, (ii) reduce the amount of the Purchase
Price by such aggregate Restoration Cost or (iii) terminate this Agreement. If
Buyer elects to require Seller to restore, repair or replace such damaged or
destroyed Purchased Assets, Seller shall complete, or cause to be completed,
such restoration, repair or replacement prior to the Closing, and the Closing
Date shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary to
complete such restoration, repair or replacement (provided that, in no
circumstance shall the Outside Date be extended unless consented to in writing
by Buyer). Subject to Section 9.1(c), if Buyer elects to require Seller to
restore, repair or replace the damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets or reduce
the Purchase Price, such casualty loss shall not affect the Closing, except
with respect to the Closing Date. If Buyer does not provide Seller written
notice of its election within forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt
by the Buyer of the applicable Independent Casualty Reports, Buyer shall be
deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Seller is required to restore, repair
or replace the damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets pursuant to this Section
6.10 and any of the Acquired Companies following Closing receives any 

 

\- 57 -



insurance proceeds with respect to such casualty event that cover such repair
or replacement cost, Seller shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Buyer with
such insurance proceeds actually received (net of any costs and expenses
incurred in connection with receiving such proceeds, net of any increase to
premiums, and net of any deductibles paid or payable) to the extent of the
repair or replacement cost paid by Seller and Buyer shall promptly reimburse
Seller from such insurance proceeds to the extent of the repair or replacement
cost paid by Seller.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If any Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed by casualty loss at any time
prior to the Closing and the Independent Casualty Report related to such
Purchased Assets is not received by the Buyer at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, then the Closing Date shall be postponed to a date
that is not earlier than five (5) Business Days after the Buyer has received
such Independent Casualty Report (provided that, in no circumstance shall the
Outside Date be extended unless consented to in writing by Buyer). 

| 
---|--- 

6.11

|

Condemnation. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If any of the Purchased Assets are taken by condemnation during the Interim
Period, then the Seller shall promptly, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days, engage an Independent Architect (and, if the Seller does not so
engage an Independent Architect, then Buyer may engage an Independent
Architect) to prepare a report as to the Condemnation Value and rated
capacities of such Purchased Assets (an "Independent Condemnation Report"). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Subject to Section 6.11(c), if any of the Purchased Assets are taken by
condemnation during the Interim Period, then Seller, in its sole discretion,
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the applicable Independent
Condemnation Reports, shall elect by written notice to Buyer to either (i) at
its sole cost and expense, replace, or cause to be replaced, such Purchased
Assets with reasonably comparable Assets or (ii) reduce the amount of the
Purchase Price by the aggregate Condemnation Value in respect of such
Purchased Assets. Subject to Section 6.11(c), if Seller elects to replace such
Purchased Assets, then the Seller shall replace such Purchased Assets prior to
Closing and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time
reasonably necessary to complete such restoration, repair or replacement
(provided that, in no circumstance shall the Outside Date be extended unless
consented to in writing by the Buyer). Subject to Section 9.1(c), such
casualty loss shall not affect the Closing, except with respect to the Closing
Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Notwithstanding Section 6.11(b), if (i) the aggregate Condemnation Value in
respect of all Purchased Assets taken by condemnation is more than an amount
equal to $20,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) Purchased Assets having rated
capacities of 10 megawatts or more in the aggregate are taken by condemnation,
in each case as set forth in the Independent Condemnation Report, then Buyer,
in its sole discretion, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
applicable Independent Condemnation Reports, may elect by written notice to
Seller to either (i) require Seller, at Seller's sole cost and expense, to
replace such Purchased Assets with reasonably comparable Assets, (ii) reduce
the amount of the Purchase Price by such aggregate Condemnation Value or (iii)
terminate this Agreement. If Buyer elects to require Seller to replace such
Purchased Assets, 

 



\- 58 -



Seller shall complete, or cause to be completed, such replacement prior to the
Closing, and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time
reasonably necessary to complete such replacement (provided that, in no
circumstance shall the Outside Date be extended unless consented to in writing
by Buyer). Subject to Section 9.1(c), if Buyer elects to require Seller to
replace such Purchased Assets or reduce the Purchase Price, such condemnation
shall not affect the Closing, except with respect to the Closing Date. If
Buyer does not provide Seller written notice of its election within forty-five
(45) days after the date of receipt by the Buyer of the applicable Independent
Condemnation Reports, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this
Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Seller is required to replace the
Purchased Assets that were taken by condemnation and any of the Acquired
Companies following Closing receives any condemnation proceeds with respect to
such condemnation event that cover such replacement cost, Seller shall be
entitled to be reimbursed by Buyer with such condemnation proceeds actually
received (net of any costs and expenses incurred in connection with receiving
such proceeds) to the extent of the replacement cost paid by Seller and Buyer
shall promptly reimburse Seller from such condemnation proceeds to the extent
of the replacement cost paid by Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If any condemnation proceeding in respect of any of the Purchased Assets is
commenced at any time prior to the Closing and (i) such condemnation
proceeding is not finally resolved prior to the Closing or (ii) the
Independent Condemnation Report related to such condemnation proceeding is not
received by the Buyer, in each case at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, then the Closing Date shall be postponed to a date that is
not earlier than five (5) Business Days after such condemnation proceeding has
been finally resolved and the Buyer has received the Independent Condemnation
Report related to such condemnation proceeding (provided that, in no
circumstance shall the Outside Date be extended unless consented to in writing
by Buyer). 

6.12 Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall pay all Transfer Taxes, if any, imposed by
Law as a result of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Shares as
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall pay all other Transfer Taxes in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in
respect of the Extraction Transactions. Seller and Buyer shall timely file
their own Transfer Tax Returns as required by Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Transfer Taxes arising
from any action to dissolve, terminate or restructure any Acquired Company or
to convey, distribute or transfer any Assets or other rights by deed, bill of
sale or otherwise to or from any Acquired Company after the Closing, other
than pursuant to the Extraction Transactions.

| 
---|--- 

6.13

|

Tax Matters. Except as provided in Section 6.12 relating to Transfer Taxes: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

With respect to any Tax Return covering a Pre-Closing Taxable Period that is
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any Acquired
Company, Seller shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared (in a manner
consistent with procedures and practices and accounting methods followed in
prior taxable periods, except as required by a change in Law) and shall
deliver a substantially final draft of such Tax Return as so prepared to Buyer
for review and comment at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is 

 

\- 59 -



required to be filed or issued (or, in the case of any Tax Returns that are
required to be filed on a monthly basis or if such due date is within forty
five (45) days following the date hereof, as promptly as practicable). Buyer
shall be given the opportunity to review, comment upon and suggest changes or
corrections to such Tax Returns prior to the filing or issuance thereof, and
Seller shall, reasonably and in good faith, consider any comments or revisions
to such Tax Returns as are requested by Buyer to the extent that such changes
or corrections are required or advisable to avoid an increase in Taxes that
may become payable in a Post-Closing Taxable Period. Seller shall cause the
applicable Acquired Company to file such Pre-Closing Taxable Period Tax Return
on or before the date on which it is required by Law to be filed with the
relevant Taxation Authority in (i) the form prepared, if Buyer has no
comments; (ii) the form agreed to by the Parties, if the Parties have agreed
on the form of such Tax Returns; or (iii) the form determined by the Neutral
Auditor, if the Parties are unable to agree on the form of such Tax Returns.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.13(a) shall not apply to non-
Canadian income Tax Returns that report the income and deductions of any
Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period but that are required to be
filed by a Person that is a direct or indirect owner of such Acquired Company
but is not itself an Acquired Company; such income Tax Returns shall be filed
by such Person and shall not be provided to Buyer.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

With respect to any Tax Return covering a Straddle Taxable Period that is
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any Acquired
Company, Buyer shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared (in a manner
consistent with procedures and practices and accounting methods followed in
prior taxable periods, except as required by a change in Law) and shall
deliver a substantially final draft of such Tax Return as so prepared to
Seller for review and comment at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the
date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed or issued (or, in the
case of any Tax Returns that are required to be filed on a monthly basis or if
such due date is within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable). Seller shall be given the opportunity to review,
comment upon and suggest changes or corrections to such Tax Returns prior to
the filing or issuance thereof, and Buyer shall, reasonably and in good faith,
consider any comments or revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested by
Seller. Buyer shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to file such
Straddle Taxable Period Tax Return on or before the date on which it is
required by Law to be filed with the relevant Taxation Authority in (i) the
form prepared, if Seller has no comments; (ii) the form agreed to by the
Parties, if the Parties have agreed on the form of such Tax Returns; or (iii)
the form determined by the Neutral Auditor, if the Parties are unable to agree
on the form of such Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
6.13(b) shall not apply to non-Canadian income Tax Returns that report the
income and deductions of the Acquired Companies that are required to be filed
by a Person that is a direct or indirect owner of the Acquired Companies but
is not itself an Acquired Company; such income Tax Returns shall be filed by
such Person and shall not be provided to Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

In the event of any dispute regarding the matters set forth in Section 6.13(a)
or Section 6.13(b), each Party shall provide the other Party with written
notice thereof within fourteen (14) days of its access to the Pre-Closing
Taxable Period Tax Returns or Straddle Taxable Period Tax Returns, as the case
may be, and 

 



\- 60 -



the Parties shall act in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Parties
cannot resolve such dispute within seven (7) days of notice thereof, the
Neutral Auditor shall be requested to make a determination resolving any such
dispute and such determination shall be final and binding. The Neutral Auditor
shall allow Buyer and Seller to present their respective positions regarding
the dispute (provided that, for greater certainty, such presentations are
limited to matters described in the dispute notice referred to above), and
each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to present additional documents,
materials and other information and to make an oral presentation to the
Neutral Auditor regarding such dispute and the Neutral Auditor shall consider
such additional documents, materials and other information and such oral
presentation. Any such other documents, materials or other information shall
be copied to each of Buyer and Seller and they shall each be entitled to
attend any such oral presentation. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral Auditor to complete its work within
seven (7) calendar days of its engagement. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Neutral Auditor shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Neutral Auditor's determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of such items in dispute as originally submitted to the Neutral
Auditor.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Seller shall be solely responsible for the cost and expense of preparing and
filing any Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (other than
a Straddle Taxable Period). In the case of any Tax Return for a Straddle
Taxable Period, the cost and expense of preparing and filing such Tax Return
shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller in the same manner as the Taxes
and any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit are allocated
pursuant to Section 6.13(f) and (g). 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Seller shall be entitled to all refunds of any Tax (including any interest
paid thereon and net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the receipt or
accrual of the refund and interest) with respect to an Acquired Company that
is attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period in respect of Tax Returns to
be filed after the Closing Date to the extent that such refund exceeds the
amount (if any) reflected as a current asset for such refund pursuant to the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount computation in
accordance with Section 2.4 and excluding any such refund to the extent it
arises from the application or carry back to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period of
any item of loss, deduction, credit, or other Tax asset or attribute arising
in or attributable to any Post-Closing Taxable Period. Within ten (10)
Business Days after the receipt of any such refund, if (i) the amount of such
refund to which Seller is entitled, exceeds (ii) the amount reflected as a
current asset for such refund in such Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such excess; if the
amount described in clause (ii) exceeds the amount described in clause (i),
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. Buyer shall, and shall
cause the relevant Acquired Company to, take (at the expense of Seller) such
action to claim a refund of any Tax of such Acquired Company attributable to a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period as is reasonably requested by Seller.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
any such refund is subsequently determined by any Taxing Authority to be less
than the amount reflected in the payment between the Parties, Seller shall
promptly return any such disallowed 

 





\- 61 -



amounts (plus any interest in respect of such disallowed refund owed to a
Taxing Authority) to Buyer.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

For Tax purposes, Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Taxable
Period shall be allocated on the basis that the Straddle Taxable Period
consisted of two taxable periods, one that ended immediately before the time
of Closing and the other that began at the time of Closing, and such Taxes
shall be allocated between two such periods on a "closing of the books basis";
provided, however, that (i) in the case of Property Taxes and franchise Taxes
based solely on capital, such Taxes shall be prorated on a daily basis to the
portion of the Straddle Taxable Period ending immediately before the time of
Closing (and in determining whether a Property Tax is attributable to a Pre-
Closing Taxable Period or a Straddle Taxable Period, any Property Tax that is
based on the assessed value of any Assets or other rights as of any specified
valuation date shall be deemed a Property Tax attributable to the taxable
period (whether a fiscal year or other tax period) specified on the relevant
Property Tax bill that is issued with respect to that valuation date), (ii) in
the case of any franchise Tax paid or payable not based solely on capital with
respect to such Acquired Company, such Taxes shall be allocated to the taxable
period for which the income, operations, Assets or capital comprising the base
of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for
another period is obtained by the payment of such Tax, and (iii) in the case
of Taxes not described in clause (i) or (ii) above (such as sales, value
added, withholding and similar transaction-based Taxes and employment Taxes,
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon
occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), such Taxes
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Taxable Period in which the
relevant transaction occurred or to which the income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit reasonably relates.

(g)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit of any Acquired Company that is a member of a partnership or
limited liability company at any time during a Pre-Closing Taxable Period
shall be deemed to include its proportionate share of any income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of any such partnership or limited liability company
for such period (which shall include its proportionate share of any income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of any such partnership or limited liability
company for completed tax or fiscal periods of such partnership or limited
liability company and shall include its proportionate shares of any income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of any such partnership or limited liability
company for the portion of any Straddle Taxable Period ending immediately
before the time of Closing as provided in this Section 6.13(g)). For Tax
purposes, income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Acquired Companies
that are partnerships or limited liability companies for a Straddle Taxable
Period shall be allocated on the basis that the Straddle Taxable Period
consisted of two taxable periods, one that ended immediately before the time
of Closing and the other that began at the time of Closing, with such income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit being allocated between the two taxable
periods on a "closing of the books basis" with such income gain, deduction,
loss or credit being allocated to the period to which they reasonably relate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) this section shall operate
iteratively through tiers of partnerships or limited liability companies so
that income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of a 

 



\- 62 -



partnership or limited liability company attributable to a taxable period
ending immediately before the time of Closing is included in the income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of the direct or indirect corporate partners for the
taxable period ending immediately before the time of Closing, (ii) the income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of an Acquired Company that is a partnership
for the period ending immediately before the time of Closing shall include any
income or gain of the partnership in respect of any interest in another
partnership that would be realized if the other partnership had a fiscal
period ending immediately before the time of Closing, and (iii) the income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of an Acquired Company that is a partnership
for a Straddle Taxable Period will be computed in a manner consistent with
procedures and practices and accounting methods followed in prior taxable
periods, except as required to avoid any negative tax basis or as required by
a change in Law.

Buyer shall be entitled to all refunds (including, but not limited to,
property tax refunds) and credits of, all Taxes of any Acquired Company other
than refunds to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 6.13(e). 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

With respect to any Tax for which Seller is responsible or refund to which it
is entitled, Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to
initiate any claim for refund and to control (in the case of a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period) or participate in (in the case of a Straddle Taxable Period)
the prosecution or settlement of any proceeding involving such Tax or refund,
including the determination of the value of property for purposes of real and
personal property ad valorem Taxes, provided, however: (A) Seller shall have
delivered to Buyer a written agreement that Seller shall be liable for the
entire amount of the Taxes covered by or arising out of the Tax contest; (B)
for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period, (I) Seller shall pursue such contest
diligently and in good faith; (II) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax contest and Buyer shall be provided copies of
any material correspondence relating to such Tax contest; (III) Seller shall
consult in good faith with Buyer regarding the defense of such Tax contest and
Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Tax contest with separate
counsel reasonably acceptable to Seller; and (IV) Seller will provide Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any representations or submissions
proposed to be made to a Taxing Authority or Court in respect of such Tax
contest and to attend any meeting with any such Taxing Authority or Court with
respect to such matters; and (C) Seller (for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period)
and Buyer (for any Straddle Taxable Period) shall not, and shall ensure the
Acquired Companies do not, settle, resolve or abandon such Tax contest without
the prior written consent of Buyer to the extent such action affects a Tax
liability of an Acquired Company for a Post-Closing Taxable Period (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed),
provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right not to consent to the
settlement or compromise of any Tax contest related to any matter which may
affect the Tax liabilities of the Acquired Companies for a Post-Closing Tax
Period, in which case the matter shall be settled by the Neutral Auditor.
Buyer shall (and shall cause the relevant Acquired Company to) take such
action in connection with any such proceeding as Seller shall reasonably
request from time to time to implement the preceding sentence, including the
selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney.
Buyer shall (and shall cause the relevant Acquired Company to) give written
notice to Seller of its receipt of any notice of 

 



\- 63 -



any audit, examination, claim or assessment for any Tax for which Seller is
responsible within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of such notice.
The failure of Buyer to provide any such notice shall not release Sellers from
any of its obligations under this Agreement unless (and then solely to the
extent that) Seller is actually prejudiced by such delay. If any Taxing
Authority is entitled to take collection action in respect of a Tax claim,
notwithstanding the defense relating thereto, to the extent it relates to
Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 10.1, Seller shall
pay or cause to be paid such amount that is subject to such collection action
to the relevant Taxing Authority within the time required by Law.

Subject to Section 6.3, Seller shall grant to Buyer (or its designees) access
at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records relating
to the Acquired Companies within the possession of Seller (including working
papers and correspondence with Taxing Authorities) and to the employees of
Seller, and shall afford Buyer (or its designees) the right (at Buyer's
expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Buyer (or its designees) to prepare or review
Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits and investigations, prosecute Tax protests,
appeals and refund claims and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.
The previous sentence shall, under no circumstances, be construed to grant
Buyer access to the consolidated United States federal income tax or any
consolidated or unitary state Tax Returns that include Seller or any of its
Affiliates for any taxable year. Buyer shall grant or cause the Acquired
Companies to grant to Seller (or its designees) access at all reasonable times
to all of the information, books and records relating to the Acquired
Companies within the possession of Buyer (including working papers and
correspondence with Taxing Authorities) and to the employees of the Acquired
Companies, and shall afford Seller (or its designees) the right (at Seller's
expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Seller (or its designees) to prepare or review
Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits and investigations, prosecute Tax protests,
appeals and refund claims and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.
After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will preserve all information,
records or documents in their respective possessions relating to liabilities
for Taxes of the Acquired Companies until six (6) months after the expiration
of any applicable limitation period (including extensions thereof) with
respect to the assessment of such Taxes.

(l)

To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this Section 6.13 and
Section 10.8 as it relates to any Tax contest, the provisions of this Section
6.13 shall govern. In particular, Sections 10.7(c), (d) (other than first
sentence) and (f) do not apply in respect of Tax claims.

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party
has designated one or more Primary Representatives to act as the primary point
of contact to coordinate communications and other interaction between the
Parties during the Interim Period. Each Party shall direct all







\- 64 -



communications with the other Party through the other Party's Primary
Representatives. Either Party may designate a new Primary Representative by
providing written notice to the other Party

6.15 Notification. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) any Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any matter that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
hereunder, and (iii) any casualty loss or condemnation effecting any of the
Purchased Assets. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the Acquired
Companies to, keep Buyer promptly informed regarding all matters of a material
nature relating to the ownership, financing and operation of the Projects.

6.17 Announcements. No press release or other public announcement, or public
statement or comment in response to any inquiry, relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by either Buyer
or Seller, or any of their Affiliates or Representatives, without the consent
of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a press release or
other public announcement, regulatory filing, statement or comment made
without such consent, including in furtherance of the requirements of Section
6.1, shall not be in violation of this Section 6.17 if it is made in order to
comply with Laws or stock exchange rules and in the reasonable judgment of the
Party or Affiliate making such release or announcement, based upon advice of
counsel, prior review and joint approval, despite Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to obtain the same, would prevent dissemination of such release or
announcement in a sufficiently timely fashion to comply with such Laws or
rules; provided, further, that in all instances Buyer or Seller, as the case
may be, shall provide prompt notice of any such release, announcement,
statement or comment to the other Party and such other Party shall have a
reasonable opportunity to comment on the disclosure related thereto (including
as to any parts of this Agreement that may be redacted on the basis that it
contains confidential information of such Party). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Seller shall have no obligation to accept any comments

determines based on the advice of legal counsel that such disclosure is
required to meet its obligations or any of its Affiliate's obligations under
applicable United States securities law.

6.18 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party shall (at its own cost and expense), and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, at any time and from time to time, upon
reasonable request, (i) do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, and cause to be
done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, transfers
or assignments as may be required to consummate the transactions in accordance
with the terms hereof and to cause to be fulfilled the closing conditions set
forth in Article 7 and Article 8 and (ii) take such other actions as may be
reasonably required in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement;
provided that in no event shall any Party be required to take any action which
(A) increases in any way the liability or obligations of such Party, (B) in
the opinion of its counsel, is unlawful or would or could constitute a
violation of any Law or require the approval of any Governmental Authority
(other than a Buyer Approval, a Seller Consent, a Shared Facilities Consent or
a Company Consent) or (C) could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become
operative after, the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be
imposed on Seller or officers or employees involved). Seller shall use

Financing, all break fees (including swap break fees) that may be triggered by
such Debt Financing involving existing lenders to Seller are minimized to the
extent possible.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding Section 6.19(a), (i) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business and operations of Seller or
any of their Affiliates, (ii) none of Seller, any of their respective
Affiliates nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other
representatives shall be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) none of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective officers, directors or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement,
document or instrument, deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
corporate or other organizational action (including the adoption of any
resolutions) to authorize the execution, entering into or performance of any
such agreement, document or instrument, in either case, with respect to the
Debt Financing, (iv) such assistance shall not include any actions that Seller
reasonably believes would cause any representation, warranty, covenant or
other obligation in this Agreement to be breached or any condition to the
Closing hereunder to fail to be satisfied, (v) such assistance shall not
require the giving of representations or warranties to any third parties or
the indemnification thereof, (vi) such assistance shall not require the waiver
or amendment of any terms of this Agreement or the payment of any fees or
reimbursement of any expenses prior to the Closing for which Seller has not
received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by Buyer, (vii)
such assistance shall not cause any director, officer or employee of Seller to
incur any personal liability, (viii) such assistance shall not require
delivery of any legal opinions or accountants' cold comfort letters or
reliance letters and (ix) such assistance shall not conflict with or violate
any Laws or Seller's Organizational Documents or result in the contravention
of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in the violation or breach
of, or a default under, any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement)
to which a Seller is a party. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

To the extent that this Section 6.19 requires Seller's cooperation with
respect to any of Buyer's obligations relating to the Debt Financing, the
existence of any alternative financing shall not operate to increase Seller's
obligations under this Section 6.19 for purposes of Article 7 or Article 8 of
this Agreement if Seller has provided Buyer with the assistance required under
this Section 6.19 with respect to the Debt Financing, in each case without
giving effect to any such alternative financing.

and any information utilized in connection therewith. Buyer shall, promptly
upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with
this Section 6.19 (including those of its accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents, investment bankers and other representatives). 

6.20 Additional Structuring. Seller shall use its good faith efforts to, prior
to the Closing, effect steps set forth in Schedule 6.20, which are necessary
to ensure that Buyer's acquisition of the Acquired Companies is in compliance
with the so-called "30% Rule" applicable to Buyer and its subsidiaries under
Section 13 of the Regulations under the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
Act (and any successor to that rule) (the "Additional Structuring"). All costs
and expenses of Seller (but not Taxes outside Canada) incurred in connection
with this Section 6.20 shall be for the account of Buyer.

6.21 Shared Facilities Agreements, etc. Seller shall take, and cause to be
taken, such action and make, or cause to be made, such payments as may be
necessary, including to cause any required Consents to be obtained, made or
delivered, such that prior to Closing the Shared Facilities Agreements, the
Common OandM Facilities Agreements, the OandM Agreement and the Transition
Services Agreement shall be executed and delivered by each of the parties
thereto in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. As soon as
practical after the Effective Date, Seller shall submit to the appropriate
Shared Facilities Lender, lenders, noteholders, trustees or agents under the
Project Financing Agreements or counterparty the forms of Shared Facilities
Agreements attached hereto at Exhibits M-1 and M-2 (or, in respect of any
Shared Facilities Agreement where no form is attached hereto, in a form
acceptable to Buyer and Seller, each acting reasonably), the forms of Common

form of OandM Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E and, if required pursuant
to any Project Financing Document or requested by any lender, noteholder,

views, in connection with the foregoing and shall provide Buyer with copies
of, and the opportunity to review and comment on, all revisions proposed by
any Shared Facilities Lender, lender, noteholder, trustee or agent, or
counterparty to such forms of Shared Facilities Agreements, Common OandM
Facilities Agreements, OandM Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, and
Buyer shall be provided reasonable written notice by Seller, and the
opportunity to participate in, any discussions with any Persons relating
thereto. Any amendments to such forms of Shared Facilities Agreements, Common
OandM Facilities Agreements, OandM Agreement and Transition Services Agreement
shall only be made if consented to by Buyer and Seller, each acting
reasonably. Seller shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated
with the foregoing.

reasonably request, provided, however, that (a) such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired
Companies or the Business or cause (or result in) any breach by Seller or any
Acquired Company of Law or any Contract to which it is a party, (b) Buyer
shall pay the costs of implementing such reorganization and any liabilities,
including Taxes, therefrom, (c) such cooperation does not require the

Seller will cause its Representatives or Affiliates not to, directly or

prohibited by this Section 6.24. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 6.24 were

breached. It is accordingly agreed by the Parties hereto that Buyer shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Section 6.24 and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer
may be entitled at law or in equity.

6.25 Receivables Owed to Partnerships. Seller covenants, except as set forth

its Affiliates to any other Acquired Company that is not the Company at any

to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer.

6.26 Waivers under the Indentures. Upon Buyer's request (which shall be made
no later than the date that is ten (10) Business Days following the Effective

Trustee"), as trustee under each of the Indentures, and the Holders (as
defined in the applicable Indenture) to waive the obligation of the Buyer to
offer to purchase all of the Outstanding Notes (as defined in the Indentures)
pursuant to section 6.1(r) of the St. Clair Indenture and section 7.1(r) of
the Conestogo Indenture, respectively and/or to consent to the change of
control of the applicable Projects under the St. Clair Indenture and the
Conestogo Indenture (each such waiver or consent request, being an "Indenture
Waiver Request"). Each Indenture Waiver Request shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Buyer, acting reasonably. Buyer shall promptly review and
approve the form of any draft Indenture Waiver Request and, in any event, no
later than five (5) Business Days after receipt and Buyer acknowledges that
each such Indenture Waiver Request must comply with the provisions of the
applicable Indenture. Buyer shall have the right, to the extent permitted by
the Indentures, to have discussions with the Indenture Trustee in respect of
any such Indenture Waiver Request. To the extent permitted by the Indentures
or as otherwise agreed to by the Indenture Trustee, Seller shall not have any
discussions with the Indenture Trustee in respect of any Indenture Waiver
Request unless Buyer's Representatives are present via telephone or in person
during any such discussion, provided that Buyer shall respond to any request
from Seller to participate in such discussions within two (2) Business Days
following receipt by Buyer of such request from Seller. If Buyer fails to
respond in accordance with the foregoing sentence, Seller may proceed with
such discussions without the participation of Buyer's Representative (but only
to the extent that such discussions are required pursuant to the applicable
Indenture). Seller shall not modify a Indenture Waiver Request without the
consent of the Buyer. All costs and expenses incurred by the Seller or
Acquired Companies (including, for greater certainty, any fees payable to the
Holders) in connection with any Indenture Waiver Request shall be borne by the



\- 70 -



Buyer. For greater certainty, this Section 6.26 does not apply to any Company
Consent that Seller or the Acquired Companies may require from the Indenture
Trustee or the Holders (as defined in the applicable Indenture) in connection
with transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

6.27 Administrative Services Agreements. On or prior to the date that is no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Date, Buyer shall

services agreement, if applicable.

6.28 Secondary Settlement. If, following the Closing, any amounts are paid to
any Acquired Company under any Secondary Settlement in respect of any period
(or portion thereof) prior to the Closing and such amounts are not included in

Companies related thereto and costs and expenses in recovering any such
amount) to Seller on or prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days
following receipt of any such amount by the applicable Acquired Companies.

6.29 Migration Plan. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
assist Buyer with all migration related activities that will be performed with
respect to the planning and preparation for and implementation of an orderly

Insurance Payment, a "Mitigation Payment"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the recovery by a Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 from any Party providing such
indemnification shall not relieve the Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1 of its obligation to mitigate Losses pursuant to Law
or this Section 10.3. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Any amounts payable to a Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1 with respect to any Losses pursuant to this Article 10 shall be
reduced by the after-Tax amount of the Mitigation Payment, if any, actually
received by the Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1
with respect to such Losses (net of all costs and expenses incurred by such
Person in connection with pursuing and recovering such Mitigation Payment). In
the event a payment is made to a Person entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 10.1 with respect to any Losses and thereafter such Person receives
a Mitigation Payment with respect to such Losses, such Person shall reimburse
the Party providing such indemnification an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the after-Tax amount of the Mitigation Payment (net of all costs and expenses
incurred by such Person in connection with pursuing and recovering such
Mitigation Payment) and (ii) the amount so paid by the Party providing such
indemnification. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that may apply, with
respect to any claim for indemnification that any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may assert regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous Material, Seller
shall not have any obligation with respect to such claim to the extent the
Losses for which indemnification are sought (i) arise out of a breach of
obligations under this Section 10.3, (ii) arise out of any action to meet a
cleanup or remedial standard under Environmental Law that is more stringent or
costly than the standard applicable as of the Closing Date for the continued
use of the relevant property or facility as it was used as of the Closing Date
or (iii) are ordinary costs of any post- 

 



\- 81 -



Closing decommissioning or demolition of any Purchased Asset owned or leased
by the Acquired Companies.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The amount of any Taxes for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be computed without regard to (and any duty to mitigate shall
not require the use of) any item of loss, deduction, credit or other Tax asset
or attribute of, the Buyer or any Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) for any period or any item of loss, deduction, credit or
other Tax asset or attribute of any Acquired Company or any Subsidiaries or
Affiliates attributable to any Post-Closing Taxable Period and not
attributable to increased tax basis of any Acquired Company arising as a
result of the application of subsection 40(3.1) of the Tax Act relating to a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period for which the Buyer has been indemnified hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

Indirect Claims. 

Seller hereby agrees that following the Closing, (i) if any payment is
required to be made by Seller or (ii) Seller has any liability pursuant to
this Article 10 or otherwise in respect of Losses suffered or incurred by any
Person, to the extent Seller has an indemnity obligation according to Article
10, Seller shall have no rights against the Acquired Companies, whether by
reason of subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement or
otherwise, in respect of any such payments or liabilities, and shall not take
any action against the Acquired Companies or Buyer with respect thereto other
than the rights under Article 10.

| 
---|--- 

10.5

|

Waiver of Other Representations. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary and except those
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Document, it is the explicit intent of each Party, and the
Parties hereby agree, that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives has made or is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, at common law, statutory or
otherwise, written or oral with respect to the Acquired Companies or any of
the Purchased Assets, or any part thereof and the accuracy or completeness of
the information, records and data now, heretofore or hereafter Made Available
or otherwise provided to Buyer in connection with this Agreement (including
any description of the Acquired Companies, the Purchased Assets, revenue,
price and expense assumptions, financial projections or forecasts, electricity
demand forecasts, environmental information or any other information furnished
to Buyer by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (including the Acquired
Companies) or any of the respective Representatives thereof) and any such
other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall release Seller from liability for Fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or wilful misconduct. Buyer has not executed or
authorized the execution of this Agreement in reliance upon any such promise,
representation or warranty not expressly set forth herein or in the
Transaction Documents. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Except for those representations and warranties expressly set forth herein or
in any other Transaction Document, Seller expressly disclaims any
representations or warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied, as to
the condition, value 

 



\- 82 -



or quality of the Acquired Companies or the Purchased Assets or the prospects
(financial or otherwise), risks and other incidents of the Acquired Companies
or the Purchased Assets and any such other representations or warranties are
hereby expressly disclaimed; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
release Seller from liability for Fraud, intentional misrepresentations or
wilful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, except for those representations and warranties expressly
provided in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, Seller hereby
expressly disclaims and negates any representation or warranty, express or
implied, at common law, statutory, or otherwise, relating to the condition of
the Purchased Assets (including any implied or express warranty of
merchantability, use, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose, or of
conformity to models or samples of materials, or the presence or absence of
any Hazardous Material in or on, or disposed or discharged from, the Purchased
Assets) or any infringement by Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates of any patent or proprietary right of any third party.
Buyer has agreed not to rely on any representation made by Seller with respect
to the condition, quality or state of the Purchased Assets, except for those
expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document.
The provisions contained in this Agreement are the result of extensive
negotiations between Buyer and Seller and no other assurances, representations
or warranties about the quality, condition or state of the Acquired Companies
or the Purchased Assets were made by Seller in the inducement thereof, except
as provided herein; provided, however, that nothing herein shall release
Seller from liability for Fraud, intentional misrepresentations or wilful
misconduct. Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement or in any other
Transaction Documents, Seller shall not have or be subject to any liability to
Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's
use of or reliance on, any information, documents or material that is Made
Available or otherwise provided by Buyer in expectation of, or in connection
with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

| 
---|--- 

10.6

|

Remedies; Waiver of Remedies. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Parties agree that damages at Law shall be an inadequate remedy for the
breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement by Buyer or Seller, and, accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled
to injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including specific
performance in accordance with this Agreement of such covenants, promises or
agreements or an order enjoining such other party from any threatened, or from
the continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or
agreements contained in this Agreement, all without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of
posting bond. Each of the Parties hereto further agrees that it shall not
object to, or take any position inconsistent with respect to, whether in a
court of Law or otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of the specific performance
contemplated by this Section 10.6 and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts set forth in Section 12.12 with respect to any action brought for any
such remedy. The rights set forth in this Section 10.6(a) shall be in addition
to any other rights that the Parties may have at Law or in equity pursuant to
this Agreement. Except for specific performance or other injunctive or
equitable relief to the extent that specific performance or such other relief
would otherwise be available to the Parties hereunder and except in respect of
Fraud, intentional misrepresentation or wilful misconduct, Buyer and 

 



\- 83 -



Seller acknowledge and agree that, from and after Closing, the indemnification
provisions in this Article 10, Section 6.3(c), Section 6.13(e) and Section
6.13(h) shall be the exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller with respect to the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 10.6, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement, or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 10.6
are not available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in
this Section 10.6 shall require any Party to institute any action for (or
limit any Party's right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this Section 10.6 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under Article 9, nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to
this Section 10.6 or anything set forth in this Section 10.6 restrict or limit
any such Party's right to terminate this Agreement, in accordance with Article
9 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then
or thereafter. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, no Party or its
Affiliates, or their respective Representatives, shall be liable for Non-
Reimbursable Damages. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Representative
or Affiliate of Seller shall have any personal liability to Buyer or any other
Person as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation of Seller in this Agreement and no Representative or
Affiliate of Buyer shall have any personal liability to Seller or any other
Person as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement, other than, in each case,
Losses resulting from Fraud, intentional misrepresentation or wilful
misconduct. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7

|

Indemnification Procedures. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence of any
Indemnification Claim or Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly cause written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to be delivered to
the Indemnifying Party; provided that, so long as such notice is given within
the applicable time period described in Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section
10.2(a)(ii), no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such
notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party
is actually and materially prejudiced by such delay. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Claim Notice shall be in writing and (i) shall specify the basis for
indemnification claimed by the Indemnified Party, including a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arisen, (ii) if such Claim Notice is being given with respect to
a Third Party Claim, shall describe in reasonable detail such Third Party
Claim and shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant pleadings, demands
and other papers served on the Indemnified Party and (iii) shall specify the
amount of (or if not finally determined, a good faith estimate of) the Losses
being incurred by, or 

 



\- 84 -



imposed upon, the Indemnified Party on account of the basis for the claim for
indemnification.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense,
to be represented by counsel of its choice and, provided that the Indemnifying
Party has irrevocably acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing the
Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect
of such Third Party Claim, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
handle any Third Party Claim and if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise handle any Third Party Claim, it
shall, within the Dispute Period, notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
its intent to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party
is Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend any
Third Party Claim (i) that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party, (ii) that is brought by a material customer or
supplier, or (iii) if such Indemnifying Party would not be liable for more
than 50% of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect in writing within the Dispute
Period to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise handle any
Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise handle such
Indemnification Claim in accordance with this Agreement. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle with or otherwise handle any
Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense
with separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the
reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by the
Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that having common counsel would present a conflict of interests or
there are additional or separate defences available to the Indemnified Party,
in which in each case costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party; and provided, further, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the
other hand, agree to cooperate with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim, including providing
information reasonably available to such Party and any assistance reasonably
requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such
claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.7 to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment (each a "Settlement") unless (i) the claimant and such
Indemnifying Party provide to such Indemnified Party an unqualified release
from the Indemnification Claim, (ii) such Settlement does not contain any
admission of Fraud or wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii)
such Settlement provides solely for monetary payment. 

 







\- 85 -



| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a Settlement or arbitration shall have
been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
Indemnification Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying
Party shall make prompt payment thereof, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within the Dispute Period to
defend against an Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to participate in any such defense at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Section 10.7 to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not effect a
Settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

In the event that an Indemnified Party has delivered a Claim Notice in respect
of an Indemnification Claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disputes with respect to such Claim Notice within forty-five (45)
days of the delivery by the Indemnifying Party thereof. If not resolved in
such forty-five (45) day period, such Indemnification Claim may be resolved
through judicial actions, suits or proceedings brought by either such party or
by such other means as such parties mutually agree. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

Seller is hereby constituted as trustee for each of the Seller Indemnified
Parties, and Buyer is hereby constituted as trustee for each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, of the covenants of this Article 10 and Seller and Buyer,
respectively, each accept such trust and agree to hold and enforce such
covenants on behalf of each such Persons. 

10.8 Tax Allocation. The Parties agree that any payment of indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1 with respect to any Losses pursuant to this Article
10 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, be treated as an
adjustment of Purchase Price and shall file all applicable Tax Returns in
accordance with this Section 10.8.

| 
---|--- 

10.9

|

Tax Benefit or Loss. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to any actual Tax Benefit ultimately
received by the Indemnified Party and arising directly from any Losses that
the Indemnifying Party is responsible for under this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Article 11). Unless such Tax item cannot
be claimed directly by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall (i)
use reasonable best efforts to claim such Tax item and, without limiting the
foregoing, will consider in good faith any request by the Indemnifying Party
to take any restructuring steps as Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party
agree, each acting reasonably, are necessary or desirable to claim such Tax
item, it being understood that taking any such steps shall be subject to the
prior approval of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) pay to
the Indemnifying Party the 

 



\- 86 -



after-Tax amount of any actual Tax Benefit ultimately received therefrom (net
of any costs and expenses incurred in connection with claiming or recovering
such Tax Benefit or Tax item) as soon as practicable thereafter (subject to
the terms of any Contract applicable to such Indemnified Party). For greater
certainty, to the extent that an Acquired Company that is a corporation has
positive tax basis in a partnership interest solely as a result of income
allocations to the corporation in a Post-Closing Taxable Period of capital
gains as a result of subsection 40(3.1) of the Tax Act attributable to a Pre-
Closing Taxable Period, such corporate partner will use reasonable best
efforts to claim a loss pursuant to subsection 40(3.12) of the Tax Act to the
extent, and as soon as, available (or would be available assuming no
distributions are received by such corporate partner prior to claiming the
loss under subsection 40(3.12) of the Tax Act) and pay to the Indemnifying
Party the after-Tax amount of any actual Tax Benefit ultimately received
therefrom (net of any costs and expenses incurred in connection with claiming
or recovering such Tax Benefit) as soon as practicable thereafter (subject to
the terms of any Contract applicable to such Indemnified Party).

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Any amounts payable by an Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of an Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss or Taxes pursuant to Section 10.1 shall be
increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates arising from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed up for such increase).

case to the disclosing Party hereby agreeing to be responsible for any breach
of this Section 11.3 by such Representatives or such other Persons as if they

of Buyer. Information shall not be deemed to be Buyer Confidential Information
if (a) it is or has become generally known or available within the industry or

of it through no act or omission of Seller in breach of this Agreement and who

consultants of Seller.

11.4 Permitted Use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, from and after the Closing, the provisions of Section 11.2 and
Section 11.3 shall not prohibit the disclosure of Seller Confidential
Information or Buyer Confidential Information by Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, to the extent reasonably required (a) to prepare or complete any
required Tax Returns or financial statements, (b) in connection with audits or
other proceedings by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority, (c) to comply
with a Governmental Authority or Law or the rules of any recognized national
stock exchange (including, for greater certainty, the New York Stock
Exchange), (d) to provide services to Buyer or its Affiliates, pursuant to
this Agreement or any of the other agreements entered into pursuant hereto or
(e) in connection with asserting any rights or remedies or performing any
obligations under this Agreement or any other agreements entered into pursuant
hereto.

|

11.5

|

Limitations on Confidential Information. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding Section 11.2 and Section 11.3, from and after the Closing,
Seller Confidential Information and Buyer Confidential Information may be
disclosed if required by any Governmental Authority or otherwise by Law or the
rules of any recognized national stock exchange (including, for greater
certainty, the New York Stock Exchange); provided, however, that: (i) such
Seller Confidential Information and Buyer Confidential Information is
submitted under any and all applicable provisions for confidential treatment
and (ii) if the disclosing Party is permitted to do so, the other Party is
given written notice of the requirement for disclosure promptly after such
disclosure is requested, so that it may take whatever action it deems
appropriate, including intervention in any proceeding and seeking a protective
order or an injunction, to prohibit such disclosure. If Seller Confidential
Information or Buyer Confidential Information is disclosed under the
provisions of this Section 11.5(a), to the extent the disclosing Party is
permitted by Law to do 

 

\- 88 -



so, the disclosing Party shall notify the other Party of the same in writing
promptly, and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days following the
disclosure.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Party hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing, it will not make
any use of any Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential
Information, as applicable, received pursuant to this Agreement, except in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or as expressly permitted in this Agreement, unless
specifically authorized to do so in writing by the other Party, and this
Agreement shall not be construed as a license or authorization to either Party
to utilize Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential Information,
as applicable, except for such purpose. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

From and after the Closing, upon a Party's written request, except as advised
by counsel that such actions would result in a violation of Law or would
violate the receiving Party's demonstrable internal document retention
policies aimed at legal, corporate governance or regulatory compliance, the
other Party shall return or destroy as promptly as practicable, but in a
period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days, (i) all Seller Confidential
Information or Buyer Confidential Information (as applicable) provided to such
Party, as appropriate, including all copies of such Seller Confidential
Information or Buyer Confidential Information (as applicable) and (ii) all
notes or other documents in digital or other format in their possession or in
the possession of other persons to whom Seller Confidential Information or
Buyer Confidential Information (as applicable) was properly provided by such
Party. Non-destruction of electronic copies of materials or summaries
containing or reflecting Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential
Information (as applicable) that are automatically generated through data
backup or archiving systems and that are not readily accessible by a Party's
business personnel shall not be deemed to violate this Agreement, so long as
Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential Information (as
applicable) to the extent contained in or reflected in such electronic backup
records is not disclosed or used in violation of the other terms of this
Agreement. 

11.6 Representation of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer hereby waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause each of the Acquired Companies to
waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating
to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"),
of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective equityholders,
officers, managers, employees or directors (any such Person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter involving this Agreement, the agreements contemplated
by this Agreement, any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Assets
other than the Purchased Assets or any liabilities other than the liabilities
of the Acquired Companies, by the Current Representation. Buyer hereby waives
and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to waive
and not to assert, any solicitor-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any internal or external legal counsel and any
Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute
between such Designated Person and Buyer or the Acquired Companies, it being
the intention of the Parties that all such rights to such solicitor-client
privilege and to control such solicitor-client privilege shall be retained by
Seller. Buyer hereby further agrees that: (a) Buyer will not seek disclosure
of any communication between any internal or external legal counsel and any
Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation in any matter involving this Agreement,
the agreements contemplated by this Agreement, any transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, any Assets other than the





\- 89 -



Purchased Assets or any liabilities other than the liabilities of the Acquired
Companies or (b) to the extent any emails or other documents (either
electronic or otherwise) containing any such communications are included in
the Acquired Companies' computer server(s) or are otherwise within the records
of the Acquired Companies following Closing, it will, upon discovery of any
such documents, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to delete or destroy all
such emails or other documents containing such communication and not review or
otherwise use such documents or the communications for any purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted to retain documents
(either electronic or otherwise) containing any such communications which are
contained in archived computer system backups in accordance with Buyer's
routine security or disaster recovery procedures if such information is not
accessible except by information technology personnel and is retained only as
required for the purpose of maintaining such security and disaster recovery
procedures.

of delivery if delivered before 5:00 P.M. Toronto time on any Business Day or
the next succeeding Business Day if delivery is after 5:00 P.M. Toronto time
on any Business Day or during any non-Business Day; provided that such email
delivery shall not be deemed delivered in accordance herewith unless a
complete copy thereof (with all attachments thereto) is actually received by
the applicable Party by facsimile, mail or courier on the next Business Day
(and if such copy is not timely received, then such notice shall be deemed to
have been effective as of the date such copy was delivered and effective by
facsimile, mail or courier in accordance with this Section 12.1). 

12.2 Entire Agreement. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents supersede all prior discussions
and agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and contain the sole and entire agreement between the Parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

12.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of,
relating to and in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

12.4 Schedules. Seller may, at its option, include in the Schedules items that
are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such
inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in any Schedule shall
constitute a



\- 91 -



disclosure for purposes of all other Schedules and each Section of this
Agreement where such information is relevant notwithstanding the lack of
specific cross-reference thereto, but only to the extent the applicability of
such disclosure to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face. In
no event shall the inclusion of any matter in the Schedules be construed as
constituting a representation or warranty of a Party or be deemed or
interpreted to broaden a Party's representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any
item or other matter in the Schedules shall be construed as an admission,
indication or evidence that such item or other matter is material, that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that such
item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Schedules. No reference in the Schedules to any agreement or document shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such agreement or document is
enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining
to be performed or any rights that may be exercised under such agreement or
document except to the extent that any such agreement or document is referred
to by reference to the Schedules in an express representation or warranty to
that effect set forth in the Agreement. No disclosure in the Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or
regulation shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The headings and
descriptions of the disclosures in the Schedules are for convenience of
reference only and are not intended to and do not alter the meaning of any
provision of this Agreement or of the Schedules. The information provided in
the Schedules is solely for the use of the Parties in connection with the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Shares and shall be subject to the terms of
this Agreement, and may not be used or relied upon by any other Person or for
any other purpose.

12.5 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall
be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any Party of
any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or
condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

12.6 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only
by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each Party.

12.7 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is
not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon
any other Person.

12.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party by merger,
amalgamation, operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the other Party, except that Buyer may (without the consent of Seller) (i)
upon written notice to Seller, assign this Agreement and all (but not less
than all) its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of
Buyer; (ii) upon written notice to Seller, assign some or all of its rights to
purchase Purchased Shares to one or more Persons selected by Buyer in its sole
discretion for nominal consideration per Purchased Share as contemplated by
Schedule 6.20, and (iii) from and after the Closing, collaterally assign this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any
Person providing financing to Buyer or its Affiliates, but, in each case, no
such assignment shall release Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement is







\- 92 -



binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

12.9 Headings. The titles, captions or headings of the Articles and Sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.10 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be adversely
affected in any material respect thereby, such provision will be fully
severable, this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
by its severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

12.11 Counterparts; Facsimile. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
electronically transmitted copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all
purposes, be deemed originals.

For the purpose of all legal proceedings this Agreement will be deemed to have

Ontario will have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain any suit, action or
proceeding arising under this Agreement. The Parties each attorn to the
jurisdiction of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List)
located in the City of Toronto. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives
and agrees not to raise any objection it might now or hereafter have to the
bringing of any such suit, action or proceeding in such court, including any
objection that the place where such court is located is an inconvenient forum.
Each of the Parties agrees that any judgment or order against such Party in
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court shall be conclusive
and binding upon such Party and consents to any such judgment or order being
recognized and enforced in the courts of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
any other courts, by registration or homologation of such judgment or order,
by a suit, action or proceeding upon such judgment or order, or any other
means available for enforcement of judgments or orders, at the option of the
Party who commences the suit, action or proceeding.

Each of the Parties hereto knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waives any
rights it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation based
hereon, or arising out of, under or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder or any course of conduct, course of
dealing or statements (whether verbal or written) relating to the foregoing
(including, any action to rescind or cancel this agreement and any Claims or
defenses asserting 

 

\- 93 -



that this Agreement was fraudulently induced or is otherwise void or
voidable). This provision is a material inducement for the Parties hereto to
enter into this Agreement, and shall survive the Closing or termination of
this Agreement.

(d)

|

Seller irrevocably appoints McCarthy Tetrault LLP (at the address set forth in
Section 12.1) its authorized attorney and agent to accept and acknowledge, for
and on behalf of it, service of any and all process in the Province of
Ontario, Canada in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement. Seller agrees that service of process upon such attorney
and agent by delivering a copy thereof, in care of such attorney and agent, at
the above address, shall be conclusively deemed to have come to the notice of
Seller at the time of such delivery and shall constitute in every respect
valid and effective personal service upon Seller at the time of such delivery,
and that failure by such attorney and agent to give notice of such service to
Seller shall not affect the validity or effect of such service or any judgment
or order based thereon or arising therefrom. Seller irrevocably authorizes and
directs such attorney and agent to accept service on its behalf and agrees to
appear in such suit, action or proceeding. Seller further agrees to take all
action as may be necessary to confirm and continue in full force and effect
the appointment of such attorney and agent so that Seller shall have an
attorney and agent for service of process in the Province of Ontario, Canada.
