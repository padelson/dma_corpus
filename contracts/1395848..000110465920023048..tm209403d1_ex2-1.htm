AGREEMENT and plan OF MERGER

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of February 20, 2020, by and among: Dialog Semiconductor plc, a
company incorporated in England and Wales (" _Parent_ "); Azara Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "); and Adesto Technologies Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

  



  

Recitals

  



  

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with this
Agreement and the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease
to exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

  



  

C. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause
the Merger to be consummated, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, each stockholder of the Company listed in _Exhibit B_ is
executing a voting and support agreement in favor of Parent (each such
agreement, a " _Support Agreement_ ").

  



  

Agreement

  



  

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  



  

Section 1. Description of Transaction

  



  

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  



  

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Hogan
Lovells US LLP, 4085 Campbell Avenue, Suite 100, Menlo Park, California, 94025
(or, at Parent's election, by means of a virtual closing through electronic
exchange of signatures) at 8:00 a.m. (California Time) on a date to be
designated by Parent, which shall be no later than the third Business Day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6_ and _Section 7_ (other than those
conditions set forth in _Section 6.4_ and _Section 7.4,_ which are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each
of such conditions), or at such other place, time or date as Parent and the
Company may jointly designate. The date on which the Closing actually takes
place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements
of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in connection with the
Closing and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the
Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as may be specified in such certificate of merger with the consent of
Parent (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

   



 



    



  

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to _Exhibit C_ ;

  



  

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  



  

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are the
directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any stockholder of the Company:

  



  

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly,
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and shall remain outstanding
as an equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company (or held
in the Company's treasury) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this _Section
1.5(a)_ and subject to _Sections 1.7_ and _1.8_ , each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive $12.55 in cash (such cash amount, as it
may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ , the " _Price Per Share_ "),
without interest; and

  



  

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
ending at the Effective Time (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is
declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to
any such event shall occur during such period, then the consideration to be
paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

1.6 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time: (a) except for shares of Company Common Stock that continue to be held
by a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(i)_ , all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such certificate, a
" _Company Stock Certificate_ ") or uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book entry (each such share, an " _Uncertificated Share_
") shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share is
presented to the Paying Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be canceled and shall
be exchanged as provided in _Section 1.7_.

  



  

1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 1.8_ , Parent shall
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payments
of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_ (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.7_ , and no
investment losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund, shall
diminish the rights of the stockholders of the Company to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent
there are losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, or the amount in the Payment Fund for any reason
(including Dissenting Shares losing their status as such) is less than the
amount required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall replace, restore or add to the cash
in the Payment Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration
to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five
Business Days), the Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were
record holders of Company Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and containing such
customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Company Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange or receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the transfer of an
Uncertificated Share, together with the delivery of a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 1.5_ , in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered or transferred shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company
Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder
in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares
or Uncertificated Shares is registered if: (1) any such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety
bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered or
transferred as contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_ , each Company Stock
Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 1.5_. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may direct) as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying
Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares.

  



  

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the date that is 360 days
after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or
transferred their Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this _Section
1.7_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims
for Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock or any Company Equity Award such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered, or any
Uncertificated Share has not been transferred, by the earlier of: (i) the
fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; and (ii)
the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such
Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share represents the right to
receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

1.8  Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a
proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with
all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being
referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails
to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 1.5_ , but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(b)  If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then, effective as of the later of the
Effective Time and the date of loss of such status, such shares shall be
deemed automatically to have been converted into and shall represent only the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.5_ ,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate
representing such shares or, if such shares are Uncertificated Shares, upon
the transfer of such Uncertificated Shares, in each case in compliance with
_Section 1.7_.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment or
settlement offer.

  



  

1.9  Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, is determined by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name
of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

  



  

Section 2. Representations and Warranties of the Company

  



  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it
being understood that the representations and warranties contained in this 
_Section 2_ are subject to: (a) the exceptions and disclosures set forth in
the Disclosure Schedule; and (b) the disclosures in any Company SEC Report
filed with the SEC at least three Business Days before the date of this
Agreement (but (i) without giving effect to any amendment thereto filed with
the SEC thereafter, (ii) excluding any disclosure contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer and any other statement or other disclosure that is
similarly predictive or forward-looking (it being understood and agreed that
any historical factual information contained within such disclosures shall
not be excluded) and (iii) excluding any Company SEC Reports that are not
publicly available on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and
Retrieval System (" _EDGAR_ ") on the date that is three Business Days before

operation of any Leased Real Property. As of the date of this Agreement, the

Product or material Company-Owned IP to any escrow agent or other Person,
other than to a Company Associate who is subject to a confidentiality
agreement with an Acquired Company with terms that reasonably protect such

(b) None of the Acquired Companies is or has ever been a party to,
subject to, or under any obligation to bargain for, any collective
bargaining agreement, works council, labor, union, voluntary recognition or
similar agreement with respect to any Company Associate or other Contract
with a labor organization, union, works council or similar entity representing
any Company Associate, and there are no labor organizations, works council,
employee associations or other collective bargaining representatives
representing, purporting to represent or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
seeking to represent any employee or Contract Worker of any of the
Acquired Companies. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
organizing, election or other activities pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by or on behalf of any union, works council, employee
representative or other labor organization or group of employees with respect
to any Company Associate. No trade union, council of trade unions, employee
bargaining agency or affiliated bargaining agent holds bargaining rights with
respect to any Company Associate by way of certification,
interim certification, voluntary recognition or succession rights, or has
applied or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to apply to be
certified as the bargaining agent of any Company Associate. No Acquired
Company has ever agreed to recognize any labor union, works council or other
collective bargaining representative. There is no union, works council,
employee representative or other labor organization, which, pursuant to any
applicable Legal Requirement, must be notified, consulted or with which
negotiations need to be conducted in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions. There has never been any unfair labor practice complaint or
charge pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against any
Acquired Company before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board or any
similar body in the United States or any other country in which any Acquired
Company has employees or performs services. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no petition has been filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any
similar agency requesting certification of a collective bargaining
representative and no other union organizing efforts are pending or
threatened. No Acquired Company has been the subject of a slowdown, strike,
picketing, boycott, group work stoppage, labor dispute, attempt to organize
or union organizing activity, or any similar activity or dispute affecting any
of the Acquired Companies or any of their employees.

  



  

(c) The Company has Made Available to Parent a list which accurately
sets forth, with respect to each individual who is a Contract Worker of any
Acquired Company or has provided services as a Contract Worker since January
1, 2019:

  



  

(i)  the name of such Contract Worker, the Acquired Company that
has engaged such Contract Worker, location of service and country of
engagement and the date on which such Contract Worker was originally engaged
by such Acquired Company;

  



  

(ii)  whether such Contract Worker is subject to a written
Contract or is engaged through an agency or on a contingency basis;

  



  

(iii)  a brief description of such Contract Worker's performance
objectives, services, duties and responsibilities;

  



  

(iv)  the aggregate dollar amount of the compensation (including
all payments or benefits of any type) received by such Contract Worker from
any Acquired Company with respect to services performed in the year ended
December 31, 2019; and

  



  

(v)  the terms of current compensation of such Contract Worker.

  



  

Accurate and complete copies of all Contracts referred to in _Section
2.16(c)(ii)_ for U.S. Contract Workers have been Made Available to Parent, and
for non-U.S. Contract Workers will be Made Available to Parent within 30 days

(d)  Each Company Associate that is classified as a Contract Worker
or other non-employee status or as an exempt or non-exempt employee, is
properly characterized as such for all purposes (including: (x) for purposes
of the Fair Labor Standards Act and similar applicable state, local,
provincial and foreign Legal Requirements governing the payment of wages
(including overtime and premium wages); (y) applicable Tax Legal
Requirements; and (z) unemployment insurance and worker's compensation
obligations), and the Acquired Companies have properly classified and treated
each such individual in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and
for purposes of all applicable Company Employee Plans and perquisites. No
U.S.-based Contract Worker is eligible to participate in any Company Employee
Plan, which is a health or welfare plan that relates to employees. None of the
Acquired Companies has any Liability for any misclassification of any Company
Associate as an independent contractor or any non-exempt employee as an
exempt employee. Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, none of the Acquired Companies has ever had any
temporary, seasonal or leased employees that were not treated and accounted
for in all respects as employees of such Acquired Company.

  



  

(e)  No Person has claimed, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
has a valid reason to claim, that any Company Associate: (i) is in violation
of any material term of any employment Contract, patent disclosure agreement,
noncompetition agreement, nonsolicitation agreement or any restrictive
covenant with such Person; (ii) has disclosed or utilized any trade secret or
proprietary information or documentation of such Person; or (iii) has
interfered in the employment relationship between such Person and any of its
present or former employees. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company
Associate has used or proposed to use any trade secret, information or
documentation confidential or proprietary to any former employer or other
Person for whom such individual performed services or violated any material
term of any confidentiality agreement or similar Contract with any Person in
connection with the development, manufacture or sale of any product or
proposed product, or the development or sale of any service or proposed
service, of any Acquired Company.

  



  

(f)  Each Acquired Company is, and since January 1, 2015 has
been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements respecting hiring practices, employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages, hours or other labor-related matters,
including Legal Requirements relating to discrimination, equal pay, wages and
hours, overtime, business expense reimbursements, labor relations, fair labor
practices, leaves of absence, paid sick leave laws, work breaks,
classification of employees (including exempt and independent contractor
status), occupational health and safety, privacy, fair credit
reporting, harassment, retaliation, disability rights and benefits,
reasonable accommodation, equal employment, immigration, wrongful
discharge or violation of personal rights including the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (and any similar foreign, provincial, state or
local statute or regulation) (the " _WARN Act_ "). None of the Acquired
Companies has effectuated a "plant closing," "termination," "relocation," or
"mass layoff" as those terms are used in the WARN Act and similar laws or has
become subject to any obligation under any applicable Legal Requirement or
otherwise to notify or consult with, prior to or after the Effective Time,
any Governmental Body or other Person with respect to the impact of
the Contemplated Transactions. None of the Acquired Companies is a party to
any Contract or subject to any Legal Requirement that restricts any Acquired
Company from relocating, consolidating, merging or closing, in whole or in
part, any portion of the business of such Acquired Company. Each of the
Acquired Companies has in all material respects properly accrued in the
ordinary course of business, and timely made all payments for, all wages,
overtime, salaries, commissions, bonuses, fees and other compensation for any
services performed, directly or indirectly, for any Acquired Company as of the
date of this Agreement. None of the Acquired Companies has any Liability for
any arrears of wages, salaries, overtime pay, premium pay, commissions,
bonuses, benefits, severance pay or other amounts, including pursuant to any
Contract, policy, practice or applicable Legal Requirement, or any Taxes or
any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. None of the
Acquired Companies has any material Liability for any payment to any trust or
other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body
with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, worker's compensation,
social security or other benefits or obligations (other than routine payments
to be made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).
Each of the Acquired Companies maintains accurate and complete records in all
material respects of all hours worked by each employee eligible for overtime
compensation and compensates all employees in accordance with the
requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the applicable Legal
Requirements of all jurisdictions where such Acquired Company maintains
employees. Each of the Acquired Companies has always been in compliance with
the requirements of the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986 in all
material respects, and each employee who requires permission and/or
authorization to work in the jurisdiction in which they carry out their
employment had at the time of hire current and appropriate permission and/or
authorization to work in that jurisdiction. None of the Acquired Companies'
employment policies or practices has ever been, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is currently subject to any non-routine audit or any investigation by
any Governmental Body.

(g)  To the Knowledge of the Company, no allegation, complaint,
charge or claim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct,
gender or sex discrimination, or retaliation (a " _Sexual Misconduct
Allegation_ ") has been made against any person who is or was an officer,
employee at the level of director or above, non-employee director, or manager
of any Acquired Company in such person's capacity as such or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, in any other capacity. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Acquired Company has entered into any settlement
agreement, tolling agreement, non-disparagement agreement,
confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement, or any Contract or
provision similar to any of the foregoing, directly relating to any
Sexual Misconduct Allegation against any Acquired Company or any person who
is or was an officer, employee at the level of director or above, non-
employee director, or manager of any Acquired Company.

  



  

(h)   _Part 2.16(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains an
accurate and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each
material Company Employee Plan and each material Company Employee Agreement
(other than offer letters, contractor/consulting agreements and employment
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that are materially
consistent with the form agreements Made Available to Parent). None of the
Acquired Companies has committed in writing to establish or enter into any
new arrangement that would constitute a Company Employee Plan or Company
Employee Agreement, or to materially modify any Company Employee Plan or
Company Employee Agreement (except to conform any such Company Employee Plan
or Company Employee Agreement to the requirements of any applicable Legal
Requirements). The Company has Made Available to Parent, in each case, to the
extent applicable: (i) accurate and complete copies of all documents setting
forth the terms of each material Company Employee Plan (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, all employee manuals and handbooks, disclosure materials,
policy statements, employee acknowledgments (or standard form acknowledgments
used), and other materials relating to employment with the Acquired Companies
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and each material Company
Employee Agreement, including all amendments thereto and all related trust
documents; (ii) the most recent summary plan description, together with
summaries of the material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA
with respect to each material Company Employee Plan; (iii) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts and funding agreements; (iv) all
discrimination tests required under the Code for each Company Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the most recent
plan year; and (v) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter issued
with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to set forth each material Foreign Plan
on _Part 2.16(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and to Make Available to Parent
accurate and complete copies of such Foreign Plans, and within 30 days of the
date hereof will provide Parent with an updated _Part 2.16(h)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any material Foreign Plan not previously
listed and Made Available to Parent and accurate and complete copies of such
Foreign Plans.

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i)  Each Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements,
including ERISA and the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be
qualified under Section 501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable
determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified
status under the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred since the date of the most recent determination that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification. Each Company
Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under applicable
Legal Requirements is so tax qualified, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred and no circumstance or condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any such Company
Employee Plan. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee
Plan. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material
Liability to Parent, the Acquired Companies or any ERISA Affiliates (other
than ordinary administration expenses). There is no non-routine audit, inquiry
or Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
or reasonably anticipated by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental Body with
respect to any Company Employee Plan. None of the Acquired Companies or any
ERISA Affiliate has ever incurred any material penalty or Tax with respect to
any Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975
through 4980 of the Code or any material penalty or Tax under applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of the Acquired Companies and ERISA Affiliates have
timely made all contributions and other payments required by and due under
the terms of each Company Employee Plan, except as would not result in
material Liability and, to the extent not yet due, such contributions and
other payments have been adequately accrued in the consolidated financial
statements (including any related notes) contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Reports. Each Foreign Plan that is required to
be registered or approved by any Governmental Body under applicable Legal
Requirements has been so registered or approved.

  



  

(j)  None of the Acquired Companies, and no ERISA Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, or
been obligated to contribute to or has any Liability in respect of, any: (i)
Company Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code;
(ii) "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or
(iii) plan described in Section 413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is
or has been funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employee's
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
No Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the Company or
any of its current ERISA Affiliates as a plan asset. The fair market value of
the assets of each funded material Foreign Plan, the Liability of each insurer
for any material Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve
established for any material Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued
benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in
such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and
obligations under such Foreign Plan, and none of the Contemplated Transactions
will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such
benefit obligations.

  



  

(k)  No Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement provides
(except at no cost to the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate of any Acquired
Company), or reflects or represents any Liability of any of the Acquired
Companies or any Affiliate of any Acquired Company to provide, post-
termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health
benefits or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to
any Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or
other applicable Legal Requirements.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(l)  Except as set forth in _Part 2.16(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
and except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will (either alone or in combination with another event, whether
contingent or otherwise): (i) result in any payment (whether of bonus,
change in control, retention, severance pay or similar payment),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Associate
pursuant to any Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement; or (ii)
create any limitation or restriction on the right of any Acquired Company to
merge, amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or Company Employee
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount payable
to any Company Associate as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event) would be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G or would be nondeductible under
Section 280G of the Code. None of the Acquired Companies has any
obligation to reimburse any Company Associate for any Taxes incurred by such
Company Associate under Section 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(m)  Except as listed on _Part 2.16(m)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
each Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement or other Contract
between any Acquired Company and any Company Associate that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A is and has at all times
been administered in documentary and operational compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A. No Acquired Company has any obligation to
gross-up or otherwise reimburse any Company Associate for any tax incurred by
such person pursuant to Section 409A.

  



  

2.17  Environmental Matters.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Acquired Companies is, and since January 1, 2015 has
been, in compliance in all material respects with, and is not subject to any
material Liability under, any applicable Environmental Law, including timely
applying for, possessing, maintaining, and materially complying with the
terms and conditions of all material Governmental Authorizations required
under applicable Environmental Laws. None of the properties currently or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, formerly owned, leased or operated by any of
the Acquired Companies contains any Hazardous Materials in amounts exceeding
the levels allowed by, requiring investigation or remediation under, or
otherwise permitted by, applicable Environmental Laws and that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability of any Acquired
Company.

  



  

(b)  In the period beginning on January 1, 2019, or earlier for
matters that remain unresolved, and ending on the date of this Agreement,
none of the Acquired Companies has received any written notice or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, other communication from any Person that alleges
that any of the Acquired Companies is not in material compliance with, or has
any material Liability under, any Environmental Law. Except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, there has
been no Release at, on, under or from any Leased Real Property or any other
property that is or was owned, operated or leased by any of the Acquired
Companies or at any property or facility at which any Acquired Company has
arranged for the transportation, disposal or treatment of Hazardous
Materials.

  



  

(c)  The Acquired Companies have Made Available to Parent copies of
all material environmental assessments, Governmental Authorizations under
applicable Environmental Laws, reports and audits obtained since January 1,
2017 in their possession or under their control that relate to the Acquired
Companies' compliance with or any Liability under any Environmental Law or
the environmental condition of any real property that any of the Acquired
Companies currently or formerly has owned, operated, or leased.

  



  

   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.18  Insurance. The Company has Made Available to Parent a copy of
all material insurance policies and all material self-insurance programs and
arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of the Acquired
Companies. Each of such insurance policies is in full force and effect, no
written notice of default or termination has been received by any Acquired
Company in respect thereof and all premiums due thereon have been paid in
full. In the period beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on the date of
this Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies has received any written
notice or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other communication regarding any
actual or possible: (a) cancellation or invalidation of any insurance policy;
(b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material claim under any
insurance policy; or (c) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums
payable with respect to any insurance policy.

  



  

2.19  Legal Proceedings; Orders.

  



  

(a)  There is no pending Legal Proceeding and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person has threatened in writing to commence any Legal
Proceeding: (i) against any of the Acquired Companies or any of the assets
owned or used by any of the Acquired Companies; or (ii) that challenges, or
that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, delaying,
making illegal or otherwise interfering with, the Merger or any of the
Contemplated Transactions. None of the Legal Proceedings identified in _Part
2.19(a)_  of the Disclosure Schedule has had or, if adversely determined,
would reasonably be expected to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b)  There is no Order to which any of the Acquired Companies, or any
of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired Companies, is subject that
would restrict the operations of the business of any Acquired Company or
involve any material Liability to any Acquired Company. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no officer or other key employee of any of the Acquired Companies
is subject to any Order that prohibits such officer or such employee from
engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or practice relating to the
business of any of the Acquired Companies.

  



  

2.20  Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. The Company has the
necessary corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, only to
the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote. The
Company's board of directors (at a meeting duly called and held) has: (a)
unanimously determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; (b)
unanimously authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and unanimously approved the Merger; (c)
unanimously recommended the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
Company Common Stock and directed that this Agreement be submitted for
adoption by the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting;
and (d) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of
causing the Company not to be subject to any state takeover law or
similar Legal Requirement that might otherwise apply to the Merger or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

2.21  Takeover Statutes; No Rights Plan. The Company's board of
directors has taken all actions necessary to ensure that the restrictions
applicable to business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
are, and will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Support Agreements and to the consummation of the
Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. None of such actions by the
Company's board of directors has been amended, rescinded or modified. There
are no other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," 
"business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statutes or regulations
(each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") applicable to, or purporting to be
applicable to, this Agreement, any Support Agreement, any Acquired Company,
the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, including any
Takeover Statute that would limit or restrict Parent or any of its
Affiliates from exercising its ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
acquired in the Merger. The Company has no stockholder rights plan, "poison
pill" or similar agreement or arrangement designed to have the effect of
delaying, deferring or discouraging any Person from acquiring control of the
Company.

2.22  No Existing Discussions. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies, and no Representative of any of
the Acquired Companies, is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any
discussions or negotiations with any other Person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to any Acquired Company. 

  



  

2.23  Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date

Company's capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger.

  



  

2.24  Non-Contravention; Consents. Neither the execution, delivery

Acquisition Proposal was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result
of a breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_ ;
(ii) the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor and the Company's outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Offer; (iii) the Company's board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (iv) prior to first furnishing
any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written notice
of the identity of such Person and of the Company's intention to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person; and (B) receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of,
an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions no less favorable
to the Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement; and (v) prior to
or concurrently with furnishing any non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent
such non-public information has not been previously furnished by the Company
to Parent).

of any Acquired Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, an Acquisition
Inquiry or any request for non-public information in connection with an

Closing Period, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48
hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or
request): (i) advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request (including the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and
the material terms and conditions thereof); and (ii) provide Parent with
copies of all documents and communications received by any Acquired Company
or any Representative of any Acquired Company setting forth the material terms
or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request
(including materials relating to the financing of any such proposal) and any
other material documentation and material correspondence relating to such
Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition
Inquiry or request and any modification or proposed modification thereto, and
shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after transmittal or
receipt of any correspondence or communication) provide Parent with a copy of
any material correspondence or communication between: (1) any Acquired Company
or any Representative of any Acquired Company; and (2) the Person that made

Inquiry or request.

similar agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Companies is or
becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies has or acquires
any rights; and (ii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or
cause to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may release a Person from,
or amend or waive any provision of, any "standstill" agreement or provision
if: (A) the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after
having consulted with the Company's financial advisor and the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to release such Person from such
agreement or provision or the failure to amend such agreement or waive such
provision would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and
(B) the Company provides Parent with written notice of the Company's intent
to take such action at least 24 hours before taking such action.

prohibit any third party from having access to any physical or
electronic data room relating to any possible Acquisition Proposal or

Representative of any Acquired Company which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or in

Company. Furthermore, the Company agrees that upon any officer of the Company
becoming aware that any employee below the level of Vice President of any
Acquired Company is taking any action that would constitute a breach of any
provision set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or in _Section 5.2_ , the Company
shall cause such employee to immediately cease such action.

5.2  Company Stockholders' Meeting.

  



  

(a) The Company shall: (i) take all action necessary under all
applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders ' Meeting_")
to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement; and (ii) submit such proposal
to, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such
proposal from, such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, and shall
not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company
Stockholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
The Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and
shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent
(unless required by applicable Delaware law). The Company Stockholders'
Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and Parent) as
promptly as practicable after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company's stockholders. The Company shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are
solicited in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement: (A) the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders' Meeting without the consent of Parent, other than (1)
to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed
to the Company's stockholders or (2) if, as of the time at which the Company
Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, (I) the Company determines that there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, to the extent necessary to
obtain such a quorum, or (II) the Company has not received proxies sufficient
to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder's
Meeting, in which case the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders' Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, with each such postponement or adjournment under
this clause "(2)" being for no more than five Business Days; and (B) if, as
of the time at which the Company Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, Parent
reasonably determines the Company has not received proxies sufficient to
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Company
Stockholder's Meeting, the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders' Meeting if Parent requests such postponement or adjournment in
order to permit the solicitation of additional proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, in which case, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to solicit and
obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable (each such postponement or adjournment to be for no
more than five Business Days).

  



  

(b)  Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_ , the Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Company's board of directors unanimously:
(i) determined and believes that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL; and (iii) recommends that the
Company's stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting. (The unanimous determination that the Merger is
advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and the unanimous recommendation of the Company's board
of directors that the Company's stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement are
collectively referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_.") The
Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement includes the opinion of the
financial advisor referred to in _Section 2.25_.

(c) Except as provided in _Section 5.2(d)_ , neither the Company's
board of directors nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or
modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company
Board Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that the Company
Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified by the Company's
board of directors in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub if the
Company Board Recommendation shall no longer be unanimous) (any such action
described in this clause  "(i)", a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); (ii)
recommend the approval, acceptance or adoption of, or approve, endorse,
accept or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or
cause or permit any Acquired Company to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar document or Contract
constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or that contemplates or is
intended or would reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in,
an Acquisition Transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in clause "(iv)(B)" of _Section 4.3(b)_; or (iv) resolve, agree or
publicly propose to, or permit any Acquired Company or any Representative of
any Acquired Company to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions
referred to in this _Section 5.2(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company's board
of directors from (A) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if
the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Delaware law or (B) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act limited to the information
specified in such rule; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
sentence shall be deemed to permit the Company's board of directors to make a
Change in Recommendation or take any of the actions referred to in clause
"(ii)" or clause "(iv)" of this _Section 5.2(c)_ , except, in the case of a
Change in Recommendation, to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2(d)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of clauses "(A)" and  "(B)" of this
sentence, any such disclosure may (and, to the extent such disclosure would
reasonably be read to indicate that the Company or the Company's board of
directors ceases to believe that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders or ceases to recommend
the adoption of this Agreement, or has modified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, shall) be deemed to be a withdrawal
of, or a modification in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub of, the
Company Board Recommendation unless, in such disclosure, the Company's board
of directors expressly states that it has not withdrawn, and has not modified,
the Company Board Recommendation.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.2(c)_ , at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, the Company's board of directors may withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation and, in the case of clause "(i)"
below, may also cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_ and, concurrently with such termination,
cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in
accordance with, and subject to compliance with, the provisions of _Section
8.1(h)_ :

  



  

   

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) if: (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and is not
withdrawn; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result directly or indirectly
from a breach of any of the provisions of _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_ ;
(C) the Company provides Parent, at least 72 hours (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of the Company's board of directors)
prior to any meeting of the Company's board of directors at which such board
of directors will consider and determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Offer, with a written notice specifying the date and time of such
meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the potential action by the
Company's board of directors (including a copy of any draft Contract relating
to such Acquisition Proposal) and the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal; (D) the Company's board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer;
(E) the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Offer, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, or the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(h)_ in order to accept such Superior Offer, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (F) no less than four Business
Days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation
or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h) _in order to
accept such Superior Offer, the Company's board of directors delivers to
Parent a written notice (a  " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (1) stating
that the Company has received a Superior Offer that did not result directly
or indirectly from a breach of any of the provisions of _Section 4.3_ or
_Section 5.2_ , (2) stating that the Company's board of directors intends to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation (and describing any
intended modification of the Company Board Recommendation) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ in order to accept such Superior
Offer, (3) specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Offer and (4) attaching copies of the most current and complete draft of any
Contract relating to such Superior Offer; (G) for four Business Days after
receipt by Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice, the Company's board
of directors has not withdrawn or modified the Company Board Recommendation
and the Company has not purported, or given notice, to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ; (H) throughout such four Business
Day period, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in
good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, or
the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ in order
to accept such Superior Offer, would not reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company's board of
directors to the Company's stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and (I)
following the end of such four Business Day period, the Company's board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation, or the failure to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ in order to accept such
Superior Offer, would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary obligations of the Company's board of directors to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Delaware law in light of such Superior
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that when making such determination, the
Company's board of directors shall be obligated to consider any changes to
the terms of this Agreement irrevocably committed by Parent as a result of
the negotiations required by clause "(H)" above or otherwise; or

(ii) if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement
a material event, material development or change in circumstances
that relates to and is material to the Acquired Companies (taken as a whole)
(but does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal) that was not known, and
would not reasonably be expected to have been known or foreseen, by any of the
Acquired Companies on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known, and would not reasonably be expected
to have been known or foreseen, by any of the Acquired Companies as of the
date of this Agreement), which event, development or change in circumstance,
or any material consequence thereof, becomes known to any of the Acquired
Companies prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholder Vote and did not result from or arise out of the announcement or
pendency of, or any action required to be taken (or to be refrained from being
taken) pursuant to, this Agreement (any such material event, material
development or material change in circumstances being referred to as a "
_Change in Circumstances_ "); (B) the Company provides Parent, at least 72
hours (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the
Company's board of directors) prior to any meeting of the Company's board of
directors at which such board of directors will consider and determine
whether such Change in Circumstances requires the Company's board of
directors to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, with a
written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for
holding such meeting and a reasonably detailed description of such Change in
Circumstances; (C) the Company's board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (D) no less than four Business
Days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation, the
Company's board of directors delivers to Parent a written notice (1) stating
that a Change in Circumstances has arisen, (2) stating that it intends to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of such Change
in Circumstances and describing any intended modification of the
Company Board Recommendation and (3) containing a reasonably detailed
description of such Change in Circumstances; (E) throughout such four
Business Day period, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent)
in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary obligations of the Company's board of directors to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Delaware law in light of such Change
in Circumstances; and (F) following the end of such four Business Day period,
the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would
still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of the Company's board of directors to the Company's stockholders
under applicable Delaware law in light of such Change in Circumstances;
_provided_ , _however_ , that when making such determination, the Company's
board of directors shall be obligated to consider any changes to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably committed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(E)" above or otherwise.

  



  

For purposes of clause "(i)" of the first sentence of this _Section 5.2(d),_
any change in the form or amount of the consideration payable in
connection with a Superior Offer, and any other material change to any of the
terms of a Superior Offer, will be deemed to be a new Superior Offer,
requiring a new Recommendation Change Notice and a new advance notice period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the advance notice period applicable to any
such change to a Superior Offer pursuant to subclauses "(F)" through "(I)" of
clause "(i)" of the first sentence of this _Section 5.2(d)_ shall be two
Business Days rather than four Business Days. The Company agrees to keep
confidential, and not to disclose to the public or to any Person (other than
the Company's Representatives) any and all information regarding any
negotiations that take place pursuant to clause "(i)(H)" or clause "(ii)(E)"
of the first sentence of this _Section 5.2(d)_ (including the existence and
terms of any proposal made on behalf of Parent or the Company during such
negotiations), unless the Company's board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure to disclose such information would violate applicable Legal
Requirements or would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Delaware
law. The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation: (x) does not change or otherwise affect the
approval of this Agreement or any of the Support Agreements by the Company's
board of directors or any other approval of the Company's board of directors;
and (y) does not have the effect of causing any Takeover Statute of the State
of Delaware or any other state to be applicable to this Agreement or any of
the Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions.

  



  

(e) Subject to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_ , the Company's obligation to call, give
notice of and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with
_Section 5.2(a)_  shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or
other Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Circumstances or by any
withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company
shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal to a vote of its stockholders.

5.3  Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof)
that is outstanding, vested and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including all such Company Options that vest contingent on the
Merger) (each, a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall be canceled, terminated
and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof
the holder of each such Vested Company Option shall be entitled to receive,
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested
Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount in cash equal
to the amount by which the Price Per Share _exceeds_ the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option (the "
_Spread_ ") (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in
respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to any such Vested Company
Option equals or exceeds the Price Per Share, then the amount payable under
this _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to such Vested Company Option shall be
zero). Each holder of a Vested Company Option canceled as provided in this
_Section 5.3(a)_  shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this 
_Section 5.3(a)_ , without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments
described in this _Section 5.3(a)_ to be paid promptly following the
Effective Time, and in no event later than the second regular payroll date
following the Effective Time, without interest and less applicable Tax
withholding. No Vested Company Option shall be assumed by Parent.

  



  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each Company Option and each Company RSU
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is outstanding and held by a
non-employee member of the board of directors of the Company, whether vested
or unvested (each, a " _Director Award_ "), shall be canceled in exchange for
the right to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to: (i) in the
case of Company Options, the Spread multiplied by each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Director Award; and (ii) in the case of Company
RSUs, the Price Per Share multiplied by each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSU. Parent shall make or cause to be made all
payments in respect of Director Awards promptly after the Effective Time, and
in no event later than the second regular payroll date following the
Effective Time, without interest and less applicable Tax withholdings.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof)
that is outstanding, unvested and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Director Awards and Underwater Options and after
taking into account such Company Options that vest contingent on the Merger)
(each, an " _Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled and replaced by
issuing a replacement restricted stock unit with respect to Parent Ordinary
Shares issued under the Parent Equity Plan (a  " _Parent RSU_ ") with respect
to that number of Parent Ordinary Shares determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Option immediately before the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio;
_provided, however,_ that in Parent's sole discretion, an Unvested Company
Option may be cancelled in exchange for a right to payment in cash of an
amount equal to the aggregate Spread of such cancelled Unvested
Company Option. In either case, such award or cash payment right shall be
subject to the same termination terms and other restrictions as the
applicable Unvested Company Option was subject to immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the same vesting schedule to which such Unvested Company
Option was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the case of
a cash payment right, payments would still be made within the same calendar
quarter as tranches would have vested under the vesting schedule to which an
Unvested Company Option was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time,
but, in Parent's sole discretion, payments with respect to different vesting
dates within the same calendar quarter may be aggregated for administrative
convenience to a payment date no later than the last day of the calendar
quarter of vesting. Parent shall not be required to treat all Unvested
Company Options in the same manner; however, Parent shall treat all Unvested
Company Options held by Persons within the same jurisdiction in the same
manner unless Parent determines in good faith that different treatment is
required by applicable Legal Requirements. No later than one week prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide written notice to the Company of the
Unvested Company Option alternative selected by Parent for each Unvested
Company Option. At the Effective Time, each holder of an Unvested Company
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the consideration, if any, pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_.

  



  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)  Parent shall not assume any, and shall not assume any obligation
with respect to any, Company Option with respect to which the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option equals or
exceeds the Price Per Share (an " _Underwater Option_ "). All such Company
Options shall be cancelled for no consideration at the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)  At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and
vested but the shares of Company Common Stock issuable with respect thereto
have not yet been delivered immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
taking into account such Company RSUs that vest contingent on the Merger) ("
_Vested Company RSUs_ ") shall be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the Price Per Share multiplied
by each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company RSU.
Parent shall make or cause to be made all payments in respect of Vested
Company RSUs promptly after the Effective Time, and in no event later than
the second regular payroll date following the Effective Time, without interest
and subject to applicable Tax withholding.

  



  

(f)  At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding and
with respect to which both the performance and the time-based vesting
elements have been satisfied but the shares of Company Common Stock issuable
with respect thereto have not yet been delivered immediately prior to the
Effective Time (after taking into account such Company PSUs that vest
contingent on the Merger) (" _Vested Company PSUs_ ") shall be canceled in
exchange for the right to receive payment of an amount (subject to any
applicable Tax withholding) in cash equal to the Price Per Share multiplied
by each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company PSU.
Parent shall make or cause to be made all payments in respect of Vested
Company PSUs promptly after the Effective Time, and in no event later than
the second regular payroll date following the Effective Time, without interest
and subject to applicable Tax withholding.

  



  

(g) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Director Awards)
(a " _Continuing RSU_ ") shall be cancelled and replaced by issuing a
replacement Parent RSU with respect to that number of Parent Ordinary Shares
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately before the Effective Time by
the RSU Exchange Ratio; _provided, however,_ that, in Parent's sole
discretion, such Continuing RSU may be cancelled in exchange for a right to
payment in cash of an amount equal to the Price Per Share multiplied by each
share of Company Common Stock underlying the Continuing RSU. In either case,
such award or cash payment right shall be subject to the same termination
terms and other restrictions as the applicable Continuing RSU was subject to
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the same vesting schedule to which
such Continuing RSU was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided, however,_ that in the case of a cash payment right, payments would
still be made within the same calendar quarter as settlement would otherwise
occur under the vesting schedule to which a Continuing RSU was subject
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but, in Parent's sole discretion,
payments with respect to different vesting dates within the same calendar
quarter may be aggregated for administrative convenience to a payment date no
later than the last day of the calendar quarter of vesting. Parent shall
not be required to treat all Continuing RSUs in the same manner; however,
Parent shall treat all Continuing RSUs held by Persons within the same
jurisdiction in the same manner unless Parent determines in good faith that
different treatment is required by applicable Legal Requirements. No later
than one week prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide written notice
to the Company of the Continuing RSU alternative selected by Parent for each
Continuing RSU. At the Effective Time, each holder of a Continuing RSU shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Continuing RSU alternative ultimately selected
by Parent.

(h)  At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (a  " _Continuing PSU_ ")
shall be cancelled and replaced by issuing a replacement Parent RSU with
respect to that number of Parent Ordinary Shares determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU
immediately before the Effective Time by the RSU Exchange Ratio; _provided,
however,_ that, in Parent's sole discretion, each Continuing PSU may be
cancelled in exchange for the right to cash payment in an amount equal to the
Price Per Share multiplied by each share of Company Common Stock underlying
the Continuing PSU. In either case, such award or cash payment right shall be
subject to the same termination terms was subject to immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such performance-based vesting
schedule shall be converted at "target" to vesting based solely upon continued
service of the holder over the applicable performance period or on the
specified vesting dates as provided in the award agreement governing such
Continuing PSU. In the case of cash payment rights, payments would still be
made within the same calendar quarter as settlement would otherwise occur
under the vesting schedule to which a Continuing PSU was subject immediately
prior to the Effective Time (as converted to time-based vesting), but, in
Parent's sole discretion, payments with respect to different vesting dates
within the same calendar quarter may be aggregated for administrative
convenience to a payment date no later than the last day of the calendar
quarter of vesting. Parent shall not be required to treat all Continuing PSUs
in the same manner; however, Parent shall treat all Continuing PSUs held by
Persons within the same jurisdiction in the same manner unless Parent
determines in good faith that different treatment is required by applicable
Legal Requirements. No later than one week prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide written notice to the Company of the Continuing PSU alternative
selected by Parent for each Continuing PSU. At the Effective Time,
each holder of a Continuing PSU shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration pursuant to the
Continuing PSU alternative ultimately selected by Parent.

  



  

(i)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
that may be reasonably necessary (under the Company Equity Plans, applicable
Legal Requirements or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
5.3_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of
Company Equity Awards shall have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this _Section 5.3_. Parent shall take all
actions that may be reasonably necessary (under the Parent Equity Plan, or
applicable Legal Requirements) to ensure that, subject to restrictions on
resale pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements outside of the United
States, the Parent Ordinary Shares issued upon settlement of Parent RSUs shall
be freely tradeable (subject to Parent's insider trading policy) and in all
material respects treated as set forth in the Parent Equity Plan summary
booklet made available to the Company by Parent.

5.4 Treatment of Company ESPP. As soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to provide that: (x) no new offering period or purchase period (or
similar period during which shares may be purchased) shall commence under the
ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (y) participants in the ESPP as of
the date of this Agreement may not increase their payroll deductions under the
ESPP from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (z) no new
participants may commence participation in the ESPP following the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event prior to the
Closing), the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i) cause
any offering period or purchase period (or similar period during which shares
may be purchased) in progress under the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement
to be the final such period under the ESPP and to be terminated no later than
three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Final
Exercise Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary
to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise
treat such shortened offering or purchase period (or similar period) as a
fully effective and completed offering or purchase period for all purposes
under the ESPP; (iii) cause each participant's then-outstanding share
purchase right under the ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised
as of the Final Exercise Date; and (iv) terminate the ESPP as of the Effective
Time. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under
the ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for
each participant under the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP (as amended pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_), and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive the Price Per Share in accordance with _Section 1.5_ ,
subject to withholding of any applicable income and employment withholding
Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP (and
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ ), be refunded to such participant as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). No
further Company ESPP Rights shall be exercised under the ESPP after the Final
Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to participants of the
setting of the Final Exercise Date and the termination of the ESPP in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

  



  

5.5  Treatment of Company Warrants.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall properly provide timely
prior written notice of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions to the holders of each Warrant in accordance with the terms of
such Warrant.

  



  

(b)  As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but
no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall, in consultation with Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each outstanding Warrant that has not been exercised to be amended to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Warrant shall
automatically be deemed exercised pursuant to the terms such Warrant, and
that such Warrant shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled,
terminated and extinguished and the holder thereof shall have no further
rights with respect thereto. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall, or shall be required to, assume any Warrant or
substitute for any Warrant any similar warrant for shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent Ordinary Shares in connection with the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

5.6  Employee Benefits.

  



  

(a) During the one year period commencing on the Closing Date (but
only as long as the relevant Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent), Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to
each Continuing Employee: (i) a base salary or base wages that are not less
than the base salary or base wages provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Continuing Employee than the benefits
provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, or in Parent's discretion, that are substantially similar to the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or the applicable
Affiliate or Parent (excluding, for purposes of this clause "(ii)", any
defined benefit plan participation, employee stock purchase plan
participation, any equity- based compensation and any change in
control, retention or similar one-time special payments or benefits).

  



  

   

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   



  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans), for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual or early retirement subsidies), each Continuing Employee's service
with any Acquired Company prior to the Effective Time (as well as service
with any predecessor employer of any Acquired Company, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer is recognized by the applicable Acquired Company
under the comparable Company Employee Plans) shall be treated as service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates; _provided_ ,
however, that such service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits; (ii) to the extent
such service was not recognized under the comparable Company Employee Plan; or
(iii) for purposes of any plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates that is a defined benefit plan or that
is grandfathered or frozen.

  



  

(c) Parent shall (or, with respect to employees outside the United
States, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to) waive, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee (or the dependents of any
eligible employee) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time to the extent waived or satisfied under the applicable Company
Employee Plan. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under the applicable Company
Employee Plan during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall:
(i) be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent; (ii)
be deemed to establish, amend, modify or cause to be adopted any Company
Employee Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates; or (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates from establishing, amending,
modifying or terminating any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, in
each case, following the Effective Time. Except for Indemnified Persons to
the extent of their rights pursuant to _Section 5.7_ , no Company Associate
shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in
this _Section 5.6(d)_  shall limit the effect of _Section 9.8_.

  



  

(e) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to
be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no
later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective,
any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan,
then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written
evidence of the adoption by the Company's board of directors of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent), effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the
Merger becomes effective. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably
request. If the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k)
Plan that is terminated pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_ are reasonably
anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary
of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any participating employer,
then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to estimate the
amount of such charges or other fees and provide its estimate of that amount
in writing to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(f) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements
are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, the Company shall consult with Parent and shall ensure that such
notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, none of the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates shall make any written or broad-based oral
communications to Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment
entitlements, including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation or
other compensation entitlements and the matters described in this _Section
5.6_ , without the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the communication
limitations contained in this sentence shall not apply to information that has
already become publicly known (other than information that has already become
publicly known as a result of a breach of this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

(g) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Contemplated Transactions shall
constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term or concept of
similar import of each of the Acquired Companies under the terms of the
Company Employee Plans and Company Employee Agreements. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause any Subsidiary of Parent to,
honor all obligations and rights existing as of the Effective Time under the
Company Employee Plans and Company Employee Agreements in accordance with
their terms (it being understood that none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to continue any Company Employee Plan after
the Effective Time).

  



  

5.7 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

  



  

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of
those Persons who are directors and officers of any Acquired Company (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions as directors and
officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company's
or the applicable Acquired Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in those
indemnification agreements between an Acquired Company and such Indemnified
Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) Made Available to
Parent, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
(to the extent such rights to indemnification are available under and
consistent with applicable Delaware law) for a period of six years from the
date on which the Merger becomes effective.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form Made Available to Parent
(the " _Existing D andO Policy_"), to the extent that such directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage is available on
commercially reasonable terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) the
Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any
substitute policies) in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid prior to
the date of this Agreement by the Company for the Existing DandO Policy (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO
Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium in the
aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of
coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) to the
amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation or, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall have the right to purchase a pre-paid, non-cancellable
"tail" policy on the Existing DandO Policy for a claims reporting or discovery
period of six years from the Effective Time and otherwise on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the terms and
conditions of the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to, and the Company
shall not (without the prior written consent of Parent), expend an amount for
such "tail" policy in excess of the Maximum Premium. If such "tail" policy
is purchased, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such  "tail" policy in full force and
effect in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation under
the first sentence of this _Section 5.7(b)_.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons, who
are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_ from and after
the Effective Time.

  



  

5.8 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

  



  

(a) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts and will cause its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to respond
promptly to any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall: (i) promptly after the date of this Agreement, and in any event
within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file
the notifications required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
antitrust or competition laws or regulations in connection with the Merger;
(ii) respond as promptly as practicable to (A) any inquiries or requests
received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for
additional information or documentation and (B) any inquiries or requests
received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or
other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters;
(iii) engage in pre-filing discussions with CFIUS, as deemed advisable by
Parent after consultation with the Company; (iv) promptly after the date of
this Agreement, and in any event no later than 15 Business Days following the
execution of this Agreement, prepare and submit the initial draft Joint
Voluntary Notice to CFIUS; _provided, however,_ that Parent may elect to
extend such 15 Business Day period for up to an additional five Business Days
if Parent, acting in good faith and after consultation with the Company,
determines that such an extension is necessary or advisable; (v) following
receipt of comments from CFIUS on the draft Joint Voluntary Notice, promptly,
and in any event within 15 Business Days, file a formal Joint Voluntary Notice
in connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval; and (vi) use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable, and no later than
the deadline specified by CFIUS for such a response, to any information
request from CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS assessment, review or
investigation of the Merger. The Company and Parent agree that if CFIUS
suggests or requests that the parties withdraw and resubmit the Joint
Voluntary Notice submitted to CFIUS pursuant to clause "(v)" of this
_Section 5.8(a)_ , the Company and Parent shall cooperate in withdrawing and
resubmitting such Joint Voluntary Notice.

  



  

   

51

 



    



     

(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with
any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings
(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) _Section 5.8(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 5.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
Parent: (i) shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy of the parties with respect to seeking any actions
or Consents of any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and coordinating any contacts with any Governmental Body; and (ii) shall take
the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Body in
connection with obtaining any such action or Consent (provided that, to the
extent practicable Parent shall consult with the Company in advance of any
scheduled meeting, conference or substantive telephone call with any
Governmental Body in connection with any filing or submission required by
_Section 5.8(a)_ and, to the extent practicable and permitted by the
applicable Governmental Body, the Company shall have the right to
participate in any such meeting and communications). Except where prohibited
by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, and subject to the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall: (A) consult with the other in good faith prior to
taking a position with respect to any filing or submission required by
_Section 5.8(a)_ ; (B) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions, proposals or other substantive written communications
before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Body by
or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with any filing or submission
required by _Section 5.8(a)_ or any antitrust-related Legal Proceeding related
to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions; (C) coordinate with the
other in preparing and exchanging such information; and (D) promptly provide
the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, notices, analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, opinions, proposals and other
submissions and substantive written communications (and a summary of any oral
presentations or substantive communications) made or submitted by such party
with or to any Governmental Body in connection with any filing or submission
required by _Section 5.8(a)_.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon
the receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any Governmental
Body in connection with any filing or submission made pursuant to this
Agreement; (ii) Knowledge of the commencement or threat of commencement of
any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions (and shall keep the
other party informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or
threat); and (iii) any request by any official of any Governmental Body for
any amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or
any information required to comply with any Legal Requirement applicable to
the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to _Section 5.8(a)_ , Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, shall (promptly upon learning of the occurrence of such event) inform
the other of the occurrence of such event and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Body such amendment or supplement.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 5.8(e)_ , each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated
Transactions on a timely basis, including obtaining CFIUS Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section 5.8(e)_
, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any), give all
notices (if any) and provide all information (if any) required to be made,
given or provided by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall consult with such party's
employees to the extent required under any applicable Legal Requirement in
connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and
(iii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any)
required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement
or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other with respect to all of the matters contemplated by clauses
"(i),"  "(ii)" and "(iii)" of this _Section 5.8(d)_ , and will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions. At the request of Parent, the Company shall:
(A) divest, hold separate or take any other action with respect to any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired Companies, provided that
any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger; and (B)
use its reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to incur any
out-of-pocket costs or expenses in connection therewith, unless Parent agrees
to pay or promptly reimburse the Company therefor if this Agreement shall be
validly terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.8(d)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement: (i) neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall have any obligation under this Agreement to (and none of the
Acquired Companies shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
agree to) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition or license
(or similar arrangement) of, or limit Parent's freedom of action with respect
to, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Companies, or
otherwise propose, proffer or agree to any other requirement, obligation,
condition, limitation or restriction on any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of the Acquired Companies, unless such actions would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to reduce the reasonably anticipated
benefits to Parent (including anticipated synergies) of the Contemplated
Transactions in an amount that is financially material relative to the
value of the Acquired Companies as a whole (it being understood that a
limitation on the ability of Parent to move any of the Company's development
activities or Intellectual Property outside the U.S., or to a specified
jurisdiction, would not be expected to reduce the reasonably anticipated
benefits to Parent (including anticipated synergies) of the Contemplated
Transactions in an amount that is financially material relative to the value
of the Acquired Companies as a whole); and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall have any obligation under this Agreement to: (A) commence or
contest, or cause any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commence or
contest, any judicial Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions, provided that Parent shall not be entitled
to rely on the non-satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 6.7_ or
_Section 6.8_ (either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or for
terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger) based on such a Legal
Proceeding or any Order resulting therefrom if Parent has not used its
reasonable best efforts to defend against such Legal Proceeding; (B) amend or
modify any of Parent's or Merger Sub's rights or obligations under this
Agreement; or (C) directly or indirectly: (1) change, or commit to change,
its place of domicile or organization; or (2) restructure or commit to
restructure any of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

5.9 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions, except: (a) to the extent that such press release or public
statement is consistent with prior press releases or public statements made in
accordance with this Agreement; or (b) to the extent that, in Parent's good
faith judgment, Parent's compliance with this _Section 5.9_ could result
in Parent being unable to comply with any applicable Legal Requirement
relating to such press release or public statement, provided that Parent
shall have offered to consult with the Company to the extent practicable.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the other Acquired Companies or any of its or their
respective Representatives to, make any disclosure, or broad-based disclosure
to Company Associates, regarding the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions unless: (a) Parent shall have approved such
disclosure (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); (b) the Company shall have been advised by its outside legal counsel
that such disclosure is required by applicable Legal Requirements and shall
have provided Parent with reasonable advance notice of the Company's intention
to make such disclosure and the content of such disclosure; or (c) such
disclosure contains only information that is already publicly known or has
been publicly disclosed (other than information that is already publicly known
or has been publicly disclosed as a result of a breach of this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions
set forth in this  _Section 5.9_ shall not apply to any press release,
announcement or disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Offer, Change in Circumstance or
Change in Recommendation that does not violate  _Section 4.3_ or _Section
5.2_.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

5.10 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior
to the Effective Time (or, at the option of Parent, at a later date) the
resignation of each officer and director of each of the Acquired Companies,
effective as of the Effective Time (it being understood that such
resignation shall not constitute a voluntary termination of employment under
any Company Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan applicable to such
individual's status as an officer or director of an Acquired Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall only obtain and deliver the
resignation of each officer and director of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries upon the request of Parent.

  



  

5.11  Delisting. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall

consummating the Merger or for terminating this Agreement and abandoning the

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be
accurate in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the

perform at or prior to the Closing shall have been complied with and performed

November 20, 2020 (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause
"(i)," in order to determine whether the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
have been satisfied, all references in _Section 6.1_ to the "Closing Date"
shall be deemed to refer instead to August 20, 2020); (ii) if, as of 11:59

final vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement; and (ii) this Agreement
shall not have been adopted at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (and shall
not have been adopted at any adjournment or postponement thereof) by the
Required Company Stockholder Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)_ if the failure to have this Agreement adopted by the Required Company
Stockholder Vote is primarily attributable to a failure on the part of
such party to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required
to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time;

  



  

(e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Required Company Stockholder Vote) if a Triggering Event shall have

this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the
date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ would not be satisfied (it
being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
subsequent date: (A) all "Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality and
similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations or
warranties shall be disregarded; and (B) any update of or modification to the
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii) any of the Company's
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached
such that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
above, if an inaccuracy in any of the Company's representations or warranties
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a
covenant or obligation by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the
End Date and the Company is continuing to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(f)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach
unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days
commencing on the date that Parent gives the Company notice of such inaccuracy
or breach;

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(g)  by the Company if: (i) any of Parent's representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of
this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the

representations or warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent is curable by
Parent by the End Date and Parent is continuing to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may
not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such
inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for
a period of 30 days commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent
notice of such inaccuracy or breach; or

and enter into a binding, written, definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Offer that has
been executed on behalf of the Person that made such Superior Offer (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), if: (i) the Company's board of
directors, after satisfying all of the requirements set forth in _Section
5.2(d)_ and otherwise causing the Company to comply with the provisions of
_Section 4.3_ and _Section 5.2_ , shall have authorized the Company to enter
into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a written notice (that includes a copy of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement as an attachment) containing the Company's
representation and warranty that the Company's board of directors has

further force or effect without any liability or obligation on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, Representatives, agents or advisors;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (a) this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect; and (b) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party
from any liability for fraud or any knowing and intentional breach of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, "knowing and intentional breach" shall mean a breach or failure
to perform a covenant or obligation that is a consequence of an act
intentionally undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge
that the taking of such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a
material breach of this Agreement.

(b) If: (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ ; (ii) the failure to consummate the Merger by
the End Date was primarily attributable to a failure on the part of any of the
Acquired Companies to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement

the Effective Time; (iii) at or prior to the time of the termination of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company

within 12 months after the date of any such termination, an Acquisition
Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition Proposal)
is consummated or a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition
Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition Proposal) is
executed, then the Company shall pay to Parent a non-refundable fee in the
amount of $15,760,000 (such non-refundable fee being referred to as the "
_Company Termination Fee_ ") in cash; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of clause "(iii)" of this _Section 8.3(b)_ , all references to "15%"

shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee in cash;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of clause "(iii)" of this _Section 8.3(c)_ ,
all references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall

Parent the Company Termination Fee in cash.

  



  

(e) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_ (in the case of _Section
8.1(c)_ only, as a result of an Order under the DPA (including a decision to
suspend or prohibit the Merger pursuant to the DPA that is publicly announced
by the President of the United States) and (ii) as of the time of
the termination of this Agreement (A) the condition set forth in _Section

$15,760,000 in cash (such non-refundable fee being referred to as the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ ") within two Business Days after such termination.

  



  

(f) Any Company Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be paid by the Company
contemporaneously with the earlier to occur of the consummation of, or entry

(g) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall
Parent or the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 8.3_ on more than one occasion,
whether or not such fee may be payable under more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
covenants and obligations contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral
part of the Contemplated Transactions, and that, without these covenants and
obligations, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement and (ii)
neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a
penalty, but rather each is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in
the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
_Section 9.12_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, under this _Section 8.3_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that under no circumstances shall any party be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the
Closing and all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be. Except in the case of fraud or a knowing
and intentional breach of any of the Company's covenants or obligations
contained in this Agreement, if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ , Parent's right to receive payment of the
Company Termination Fee from the Company in the circumstances under which
such fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ (plus, if the Company
Termination Fee is not timely paid, the interest, fees and expenses described
in _Section 8.3(h)_) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub against the Company for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement, and upon
payment of such amount, the Company and its current, former or future
stockholders or Representatives shall not have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions. Except in the case of fraud or a knowing and intentional breach
of any of Parent's or Merger Sub's covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement, if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.1_ , the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee from Parent in the circumstances under which such fee is
payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ (plus, if the Parent Termination Fee
is not timely paid, the interest, fees and expenses described in _Section
8.3(h)_) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
against Parent and Merger Sub for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement, and upon payment of
such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective current,
former or future stockholders or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

(h) If any party fails to pay when due any amount payable under this
_Section 8.3_ , then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party for all
costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in
connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by
the other party of its rights under this _Section 8.3;_ and (ii) such party
shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for the period
commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be
paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent
in full) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Prime Rate in effect on
the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid plus 300
basis points.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(i) Any fee or other amount payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3_
shall be paid free and clear of all deductions and withholdings. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that any amount payable under

or Merger Sub in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including
with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof), other than the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 2_ and in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plans and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company's business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information. Accordingly,
subject to _Section 9.8(c)_ , each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that neither the Company nor its stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives,
nor any other Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty or
has or shall have any liability (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort
or otherwise) with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts,
forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
except as expressly set forth in _Section 2_ or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in _Section 9.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit any right or remedy of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates in the event of fraud with the intent to deceive (regardless of
whether such fraud relates to an express representation or warranty in this
Agreement).

9.10 Cooperation. Each party agrees to cooperate fully with the
other parties and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates,
agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be
reasonably requested such other parties to evidence or reflect the
Contemplated Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Agreement.

  



  

9.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision. In the
event that the parties are unable to agree to such replacement, the parties
agree that the court making the determination referred to above shall have the
power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or
to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid
and enforceable as so modified.

irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement required to be performed by any of the parties were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by any party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, any
non-breaching party shall be entitled to obtain, without proof of actual
damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which such non-breaching
party may be entitled at law or in equity): (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation; and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. Each of the parties hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. If, prior
to the End Date, any party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
End Date shall automatically be extended by: (i) the amount of time during
which such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (ii) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such Legal
Proceeding, as the case may be.
