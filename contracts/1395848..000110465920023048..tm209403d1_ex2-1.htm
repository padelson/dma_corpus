have valid and subsisting leasehold interests in and to all of the Leased Real Property, except where the failure to have such
interest would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies, taken as
a whole. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies,
taken as a whole, all of the Leases are valid and in full force and effect, have not been modified, amended or supplemented, in
writing or otherwise, and all rents, additional rents and other amounts due pursuant to each Lease have been paid, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no default or event which, with the passage of time, the giving of notice or both, would become
a default by any party under any Lease. The Company has Made Available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all Leases.</P>

</FONT></B>Each Acquired Company is, and since January 1, 2015 has been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Legal Requirements respecting hiring practices, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours or other
labor-related matters, including Legal Requirements relating to discrimination, equal pay, wages and hours, overtime, business
expense reimbursements, labor relations, fair labor practices, leaves of absence, paid sick leave laws, work breaks, classification
of employees (including exempt and independent contractor status), occupational health and safety, privacy, fair credit reporting,
harassment, retaliation, disability rights and benefits, reasonable accommodation, equal employment, immigration, wrongful discharge
or violation of personal rights including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (and any similar foreign, provincial,
state or local statute or regulation) (the &ldquo;<U>WARN Act</U>&rdquo;). None of the Acquired Companies has effectuated a &ldquo;plant
closing,&rdquo; &ldquo;termination,&rdquo; &ldquo;relocation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mass layoff&rdquo; as those terms are used in the
WARN Act and similar laws or has become subject to any obligation under any applicable Legal Requirement or otherwise to notify
or consult with, prior to or after the Effective Time, any Governmental Body or other Person with respect to the impact of the
Contemplated Transactions. None of the Acquired Companies is a party to any Contract or subject to any Legal Requirement that
restricts any Acquired Company from relocating, consolidating, merging or closing, in whole or in part, any portion of the business
of such Acquired Company. Each of the Acquired Companies has in all material respects properly accrued in the ordinary course
of business, and timely made all payments for, all wages, overtime, salaries, commissions, bonuses, fees and other compensation
for any services performed, directly or indirectly, for any Acquired Company as of the date of this Agreement. None of the Acquired
Companies has any Liability for any arrears of wages, salaries, overtime pay, premium pay, commissions, bonuses, benefits, severance
pay or other amounts, including pursuant to any Contract, policy, practice or applicable Legal Requirement, or any Taxes or any
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. None of the Acquired Companies has any material Liability for any payment
to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, worker&rsquo;s compensation, social security or other benefits or obligations (other than routine payments to be made
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Each of the Acquired Companies maintains accurate and complete
records in all material respects of all hours worked by each employee eligible for overtime compensation and compensates all employees
in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the applicable Legal Requirements of all jurisdictions
where such Acquired Company maintains employees. Each of the Acquired Companies has always been in compliance with the requirements
of the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986 in all material respects, and each employee who requires permission and/or authorization
to work in the jurisdiction in which they carry out their employment had at the time of hire current and appropriate permission
and/or authorization to work in that jurisdiction. None of the Acquired Companies&rsquo; employment policies or practices has
ever been, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is currently subject to any non-routine audit or any investigation by any Governmental
Body.</P>

</FONT></B>Each Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA and the Code. Any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be qualified under Section&nbsp;501(a)
of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the
Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of the most recent determination that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect such qualification. Each Company Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under applicable Legal
Requirements is so tax qualified, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no circumstance or condition
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any such Company Employee Plan. No &ldquo;prohibited
transaction,&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under
Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material Liability to Parent, the Acquired Companies
or any ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses). There is no non-routine audit, inquiry or Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental Body
with respect to any Company Employee Plan. None of the Acquired Companies or any ERISA Affiliate has ever incurred any material
penalty or Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code
or any material penalty or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements. Each of the Acquired Companies and ERISA Affiliates have timely
made all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan, except as would not
result in material Liability and, to the extent not yet due, such contributions and other payments have been adequately accrued
in the consolidated financial statements (including any related notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Reports. Each Foreign Plan that is required to be registered or approved by any Governmental Body under applicable Legal Requirements
has been so registered or approved.</P>

of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in Section&nbsp;413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded by, associated
with or related to a &ldquo;voluntary employee&rsquo;s beneficiary association&rdquo; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;501(c)(9)
of the Code. No Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the Company or any of its current ERISA Affiliates
as a plan asset. The fair market value of the assets of each funded material Foreign Plan, the Liability of each insurer for any
material Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any material Foreign Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current

to determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and none of the Contemplated Transactions will
cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.</P>
