Section 2\. _Description of Transaction_

 

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The
Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

 

2.2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. As a result of
the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oasis.

2.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 7_, _8_
and _9_ , the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
remotely, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 7_, _8_ and _9_ ,
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions), or at such other time, date and place as Oasis and the Company
may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the Closing actually takes
place is referred to as the "Closing Date." At the Closing, the Parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by executing and filing with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger, satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL and in form and
substance as agreed to by the Parties (the "Certificate of Merger"). The
Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as may be specified in such Certificate of Merger with the consent of
Oasis and the Company (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being
referred to as the "Effective Time").

 

2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. At the
Effective Time:

 

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth in an exhibit to the Certificate of Merger,
until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation;

(b) the certificate of incorporation of Oasis shall be identical to the
certificate of incorporation of Oasis immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Oasis shall
file an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to (i) effect the Oasis
Reverse Stock Split, (ii) __ change the name of Oasis to "Adicet Bio, Inc."
and (iii) __ make such other changes as are mutually agreeable to Oasis and
the Company;

 



19

    

(c) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to the bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such bylaws;

(d) the directors and officers of Oasis, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Oasis, shall be as set
forth in _Section 6.14_; and

 

(e) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, shall be the directors and officers of Oasis as set
forth in _Section 6.14_, after giving effect to the provisions of _Section
6.14_.

 

2.5 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Oasis, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company or Oasis:

(i) any shares of Company Capital Stock held as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

 

(ii) subject to _Section 2.5(c)_, each share of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(i)_ and excluding Dissenting Shares)
shall be automatically converted solely into the right to receive a number of
shares of Oasis Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
Consideration").

(b) If any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option or a
risk of forfeiture under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or
other similar agreement with the Company, then the shares of Oasis Common
Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Capital Stock will to the
same extent be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option or risk of
forfeiture, and such shares of Oasis Common Stock shall accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions that may be reasonably necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, Oasis is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.

(c) No fractional shares of Oasis Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued, with no cash being paid for any fractional share eliminated
by such rounding. Any fractional shares of Oasis Common Stock a holder of
Company Capital Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive shall be
aggregated together first prior to eliminating any remaining fractional share.

 



20

    

(d) All Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the Company Plans and all Company Warrants shall be treated in
accordance with _Section 6.5_.

(e) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence
ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(f) If, between the time of calculating the Exchange Ratio and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or Oasis Common Stock
shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split (including the Oasis Reverse Stock
Split to the extent such split has not previously been taken into account in
calculating the Exchange Ratio), combination or exchange of shares or other
like change, the Exchange Ratio shall, to the extent necessary, be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change to the extent necessary to provide the
holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants, Oasis
Options, Oasis Restricted Stock Units and Oasis Common Stock with the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or other like change; provided, however, that nothing
herein will be construed to permit the Company or Oasis to take any action
with respect to Company Capital Stock or Oasis Common Stock, respectively,
that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

2.6 _Contingent Value Right_ _._

 

(a) Holders of Oasis Common Stock of record as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those shares of Oasis
Common Stock issued upon settlement of Oasis Restricted Stock Units pursuant
to Section 6.8) shall be entitled to one contractual contingent value right (a
"CVR") issued by Oasis subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the CVR Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (the "CVR Agreement"), for each share of Oasis Common Stock held
by such holders.

 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Oasis shall authorize and duly adopt,
execute and deliver, and will ensure that Exchange Agent and Holders
Representative (as defined in the CVR Agreement) execute and deliver, the CVR
Agreement, subject to any reasonable revisions to the CVR Agreement that are
requested by such Exchange Agent and are reasonably acceptable to the
Company and the Holders Representative (as defined in the CVR Agreement)
(provided that such revisions are not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially detrimental or adverse, taken as a whole, to any holder of CVR).
Oasis and the Company shall cooperate, including by making changes to the
form of CVR Agreement, as necessary to ensure that the CVRs are not subject to
registration under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws.

(c) Oasis, the Exchange Agent and (if necessary) Holders Representative
shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, duly authorize, execute and deliver
the CVR Agreement.

 



21

    

2.7 _Closing of the Company_ __ _s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time:
(a) all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_,
and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company and (b) the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company
Stock Certificate") is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in _Sections_ __ _ 2.5_ and _2.8_.

2.8  _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Oasis and the Company shall jointly
select a reputable bank, transfer agent or trust company to act as exchange
agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At the Effective Time, Oasis shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent evidence of book-entry shares representing the
shares of Oasis Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ in
exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Parties shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Oasis may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) __ instructions for effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates in exchange for book-entry shares of Oasis Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Oasis: (A) __ the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor book-entry shares representing the Merger Consideration (in
a number of whole shares of Oasis Common Stock) that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.5(a)_ and (B) __ the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(b)_ , each Company Stock Certificate
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive book-entry shares of Oasis Common Stock representing the
Merger Consideration. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Oasis may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the delivery of any shares of Oasis Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an applicable affidavit with respect to such Company Stock Certificate and
post a bond indemnifying Oasis against any claim suffered by Oasis related to
the lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate or any Oasis Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor as Oasis may reasonably request.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Oasis
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Oasis Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or provides
an affidavit of loss or destruction in lieu thereof in accordance with this
_Section 2.8_ (at which time (or, if later, on the applicable payment date)
such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws, to receive all such dividends and
distributions, without interest).

 



22

    

(d) Any shares of Oasis Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent that
remain undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date
that is 180 days after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Oasis upon
demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section
2.8_ shall thereafter look only to Oasis for satisfaction of their claims for
Oasis Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares
of Oasis Common Stock.

 

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Oasis, Company Options Trustee and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or
under any other applicable Law; provided, that if Oasis intends to deduct or
withhold (or intends to instruct the Exchange Agent or the Company Options
Trustee to deduct or withhold) from any payment of consideration deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement, Oasis shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(1) provide the Company and the applicable payee with reasonably advance
notice of such intention to withhold and (2) __ permit the Company and/or
such payee to provide such certifications or other documentation as may be
necessary and appropriate to permit such payment to be made free of, or at a
reduced rate of, withholding, including, with regard to Company Israeli
Options and Company Israeli Options Shares, an Israeli Tax Ruling in
accordance with _Section 6.12(b)_ below. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) No Party shall be liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or
to any other Person with respect to any shares of Oasis Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or for any cash amounts
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

2.9 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and perfected
appraisal rights for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with
the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration described in
_Section 2.5_ attributable to such Dissenting Shares. Such stockholders shall
be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Company Capital Stock held by them in accordance with the DGCL, unless and
until such stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise
lose their appraisal rights under the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares of Company Capital
Stock under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective
Time) shall thereupon be deemed to be converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration attributable to such Dissenting Shares upon their surrender in
the manner provided in _Section 2.5_.

 



23

    

(b) The Company shall give Oasis prompt written notice of any demands by
dissenting stockholders received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served on the Company and any material
correspondence received by the Company in connection with such demands, and
the Company shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without Oasiss prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of the Company, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized, and shall use their and its
commercially reasonable efforts (in the name of the Company, in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take
such action.

2.11 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal (and applicable state and local)
income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_.

 

Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3_, except as set forth in the written disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Oasis (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Oasis and Merger Sub as
follows:

3.1 _Due Organization; Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal
entity duly incorporated or otherwise organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all necessary corporate power and authority: (i) __ to
conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being
conducted, (ii) __ to own or lease and use its property and assets in the
manner in which its property and assets are currently owned or leased and used
and (iii) __ to perform its obligations under all Contracts by which it is
bound _._

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed and qualified to
do business, and is in good standing (to the extent applicable in such
jurisdiction), under the Laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its
business requires such licensing or qualification other than in jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified individually or in the aggregate would
not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the Entities identified in
Section __ 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and neither the Company
nor any of the Entities identified in Section __ 3.1(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule owns any capital stock of, or any equity, ownership or
profit sharing interest of any nature in, or controls directly or indirectly,
any other Entity other than the Entities identified in Section __ 3.1(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except for strategic relationships to
promote the Companys products and services, which relationships are conducted
through contractual relationships between the

 



24

    

 Company and its strategic partners, but do not involve any interest of the
Company in any separate legal entity, and as set forth on Section __ 3.1(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is and or has otherwise been, directly or indirectly, a party to,
member of or participant in any partnership, joint venture or similar business
entity. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is
obligated to make, or is bound by any Contract under which it may become
obligated to make, any future investment in or capital contribution to any
other Entity. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, at any
time, been a general partner of, or has otherwise been liable for any of the
debts or other obligations of, any general partnership, limited partnership or
other Entity.

 

3.2 _Organizational Documents_. The Company has delivered to Oasis accurate
and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach or violation of its Organizational Documents in any material respect.

 

3.3 _Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to receipt of
the Required Company Stockholder Vote, to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. The Company Board has (i) determined that the Contemplated
Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions and (iii) determined to recommend, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that the
stockholders of the Company vote to adopt or approve the Agreement and thereby
approve the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Oasis and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Prior to the execution
of the Company Stockholder Support Agreements, the Company Board approved the
Company Stockholder Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated
thereby.

 

3.4 _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote or written consent of (a) the
holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital Stock (on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis), (b) the holders of a majority of the
shares of Company Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on
an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis) and (c) the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock (on an as-converted
to Company Common Stock basis), voting as a single class, in each case,
outstanding on the record date for the Company Stockholder Written Consent and
entitled to vote thereon (the "Required Company Stockholder Vote"), is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

3.5 _Non-Contravention; Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote and the filing
of the Certificate of Merger required by the DGCL, and except as set forth on
Section __ 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither (x) __ the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company, nor (y)
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, will directly or
indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time):

 



25

    

(i) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any of
the provisions of the Companys Organizational Documents;

(ii) contravene, conflict with or result in a material violation of, or give
any Governmental Authority or other Person the right to challenge the
Contemplated Transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief
under, any Law or any Order by which the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any
of the assets owned or used by the Company or its Subsidiaries, is subject;

(iii) contravene, conflict with or result in a material violation of any of
the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Authority the right to

Subsidiaries to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person

or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer (and is not withdrawn)
if: (A) neither such Party nor any Representative of such Party shall have
breached this _Section 5.4_ in any material respect, (B) the board of
directors of such Party concludes in good faith based on the advice of outside

representation or warranty made by such Party in this Agreement or (d) the

in each case that could reasonably be expected to make the timely satisfaction

applicable, impossible or materially less likely. No such notice shall be
deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Oasis
Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (x) determining the accuracy of any of
the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement or
(y) determining whether any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7_, _8_ or
_9_ has been satisfied. Any failure by either Party to provide notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall not be deemed to be a breach for
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or _9.2_ , as applicable, unless

Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Oasis Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger. Each of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the other
Party and furnish all information concerning itself and their Affiliates, as
applicable, to the other Parties that is required by law to be included in the
Registration Statement or as the other Parties may reasonably request in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Registration Statement
and Proxy Statement.

(b) Oasis covenants and agrees that the Registration Statement (and the
letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy included
therewith) will not, at any Applicable Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company
covenants and agrees that the information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to Oasis for inclusion in the Registration
Statement (including the Company Financials) will not, at any Applicable Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make such
information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Oasis makes no covenant,
representation or warranty with respect to statements made in the
Registration Statement (and the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and
form of proxy included therewith), if any, based on information provided by
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives for inclusion
therein and (ii) the Company makes no covenant, representation or warranty
with respect to statements made in the Registration Statement (and the letter
to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy included therewith), if
any, based on information provided by Oasis or its Subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives for inclusion therein.

(c) Oasis shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Oasiss stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act.

 

(d) If at any time before the Effective Time (i) any Party (A) becomes aware
of any event or information that, pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, (B) receives notice of any SEC
request for an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or for
additional information related thereto, or (C) receives SEC comments on the
Registration Statement, or (ii) the information provided in the Registration
Statement has become "stale" and new information should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement; then in each such case
such Party, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other Parties
thereof and shall cooperate with such other Parties in filing such amendment
or supplement with the SEC (and, if related to the Proxy Statement, mailing
such amendment or supplement to the Oasis stockholders) or otherwise
addressing such SEC request or comments and each Party and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if
required. Oasis shall promptly notify the Company if it becomes aware (1) that
the Registration Statement has become effective, (2) of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification or registration of the
Oasis Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or (3) any order of the SEC related to the
Registration Statement, and shall promptly provide to the Company copies of
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Registration Statement and all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration
Statement.

(e) Without limiting the Companys obligation in _Section 6.1(a)_,
the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered
to Oasis a letter of the Companys independent accounting firm, dated no more
than two (2) __ Business Days before the date on which the Registration
Statement becomes effective (and reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Oasis), that is customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Registration Statement.

(f) The Company and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Registration Statement, including all amendments
and supplements thereto, prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and on the
response to any comments of the SEC on the Registration Statement, prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Registration Statement will be made by Oasis, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by Oasis, in each
case, without the prior consent of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(g) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
the Company will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companys financial statements for the fiscal year ended December __ 31, 2019
to be delivered to Oasis in a manner as is required under applicable Law for
the inclusion of such financial statements in the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and (ii) __ furnish to Oasis unaudited interim
financial statements for each interim period completed prior to Closing that
would be required to be included in the Registration Statement or any
periodic report due prior to the Closing if the Company were subject to the
periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(the "Company Interim Financial Statements"). Each of the audited financial
statements of the Company for each of its fiscal years required to be included
in the Registration Statement (the "Company Audited Financial Statements") and
the Company Interim Financial Statements will be suitable for inclusion in
the Registration Statement and prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except in each case as
described in the notes thereto) and on that basis will present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and the results of operations,
changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows of the Company as of the dates
of and for the periods referred to in the Company Audited
Financial Statements or the Company Interim Financial Statements, as the case
may be.

6.2 _Company Stockholder Written Consent_.

 

(a) Promptly after the Registration Statement has been declared effective
under the Securities Act, and in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days thereafter, the Company shall solicit for approval by written consent
from Company stockholders sufficient for the Required Company Stockholder Vote
in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section __228 of the DGCL, for purposes of
(i) __ adopting and approving this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, (ii) __ acknowledging that the approval given thereby is
irrevocable and that such stockholder is aware of its rights to demand
appraisal for its shares pursuant to Section __ 262 of the DGCL, a copy of
which will be attached thereto, and that such stockholder has received and
read a copy of Section __ 262 of the DGCL and (iii) __ acknowledging that by
its approval of the Merger it is not entitled to appraisal rights with
respect to its shares in connection with the Merger and thereby waives any
rights to receive payment of the fair value of its capital stock under the
DGCL. Under no circumstances shall the Company assert that any other approval
or consent is necessary by its stockholders to approve this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



73

    

(b) Reasonably promptly following receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Vote, the Company shall prepare and mail a notice (the "Stockholder Notice")
to every stockholder of the Company that did not execute the Company
Stockholder Written Consent. The Stockholder Notice shall (i) be a statement
to the effect that the Company Board determined that the Merger is advisable
in accordance with Section 251(b) of the DGCL and in the best interests of the
stockholders of the Company and approved and adopted this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, (ii) provide the stockholders
of the Company to whom it is sent with notice of the actions taken in the
Company Stockholder Written Consent, including the adoption and approval of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions in
accordance with Section 228(e) of the DGCL and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (iii) include a description of the
appraisal rights of the Companys stockholders available under the DGCL, along
with such other information as is required thereunder and pursuant to
applicable Law. All materials (including any amendments thereto) submitted to
the stockholders of the Company in accordance with this Section 6.2(b) shall
be subject to Oasiss advance review and reasonable approval.

(c) The Company agrees that, subject to _Section 6.2(d)_: (i) the Company
Board shall recommend that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit such approval within the time set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ (the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote to adopt and approve this Agreement being referred
to as the "Company Board Recommendation") and (ii) the Company Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified (and the Company Board
shall not publicly propose to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation) in a manner adverse to Oasis, and no resolution by the Company
Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Oasis or to adopt, approve or recommend
(or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal
shall be adopted or proposed.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(c)_ ,
and subject to compliance with _Section 5.4_ and  _Section 6.2_, if at any
time prior to approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a bona fide written Superior Offer, the
Company Board may withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation (or publicly propose to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation) in a manner adverse to Oasis (collectively, a
"Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change") if, but only if, following the
receipt of and on account of such Superior Offer, (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has, and has caused its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to, during the Notice Period (as defined
below), negotiate with Oasis in good faith to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Offer and (iii) if after Oasis shall have
delivered to the Company a written offer to alter the terms or conditions of
this Agreement during the Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (after taking into account such
alterations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement); provided that (x)
Oasis receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company
Board has determined to change its recommendation at least five (5) Business
Days in advance of the Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change (the
"Notice  

 



74

    

 Period"), which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of
the reasons for such Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change, and written
copies of any relevant proposed transaction agreements with any party making
a potential Superior Offer, (y) during any Notice Period, Oasis shall be
entitled to deliver to the Company one or more counterproposals to such
Acquisition Proposal and the Company will, and cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Oasis in good faith (to the extent Oasis desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the applicable Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer and
(z) in the event of any material amendment to any Superior Offer (including
any revision in the amount, form or mix of consideration or percentage of the
combined company that the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of
such potential Superior Offer), the Company shall be required to provide Oasis
with notice of such material amendment and the Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least four (4) Business Days remain
in the Notice Period following such notification during which the parties
shall comply again with the requirements of this _Section 6.2(d)_ and the
Company Board shall not make a Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change
prior to the end of such Notice Period as so extended (it being understood
that there may be multiple extensions).

(e) The Companys obligation to solicit the consent of its stockholders to
sign the Company Stockholder Written Consent in accordance with _Section
6.2(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other
Acquisition Proposal, or by any Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change.

6.3 _Oasis Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) Oasis shall take all action necessary under applicable Law to call, give
notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Oasis Common Stock to consider
and vote to approve this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions,
including the issuance of the shares of Oasis Common Stock to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and an amendment to
Oasiss certificate of incorporation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (collectively, the "Oasis Stockholder Matters" and such meeting, the
"Oasis Stockholder Meeting"). The Oasis Stockholder Meeting shall be held as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act, and in any event no later than forty-five (45) days
after the effective date of the Registration Statement. Oasis shall
take reasonable measures to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
with the Oasis Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
on the date of the Oasis Stockholder Meeting, or a date preceding the date on
which the Oasis Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Oasis reasonably believes
that (i) __ it will not receive proxies sufficient to obtain the Required
Oasis Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum would be present or (ii) __
it will not have sufficient shares of Oasis Common Stock represented (whether
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Oasis Stockholder Meeting, Oasis may postpone or adjourn, or
make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Oasis
Stockholder Meeting as long as the date of the Oasis Stockholder Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 30 calendar days
in connection with any postponements or adjournments; _provided, however,_
that more than one such postponement or adjournment shall not be permitted
without the Companys prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



75

    

(b) Oasis agrees that, subject to _Section 6.3(c)_: (i) the Oasis Board
shall recommend that the holders of Oasis Common Stock vote to approve the
Oasis Stockholder Matters and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit such approval within the timeframe set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_
above, (ii) __the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect
that the Oasis Board recommends that Oasis s stockholders vote to approve the
Oasis Stockholder Matters (the recommendation of the Oasis Board being
referred to as the "Oasis Board Recommendation") and (iii) the Oasis Board
Recommendation shall not be withheld, amended, withdrawn or modified (and the
Oasis Board shall not publicly propose to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify
the Oasis Board Recommendation) in a manner adverse to the Company, and no
resolution by the Oasis Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify
the Oasis Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company or to adopt,
approve or recommend (or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal shall be adopted or proposed (the actions set forth in
the foregoing clause (iii), collectively, a "Oasis Board Adverse
Recommendation Change").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(b)_,
and subject to compliance with _Section 5.4_ and _Section 6.3_, at any time
prior to the approval of Oasis Stockholder Matters by the Required Oasis
Stockholder Vote, Oasis receives a bona fide written Superior Offer, the Oasis
Board may make an Oasis Board Adverse Recommendation Change if, but only if
following the receipt of and on account of such Superior Offer, (i) __ the
Oasis Board determines in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such
recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) __ Oasis has, and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, during the Oasis
Notice Period, negotiate with the Company in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer and (iii) __ if
after the Company shall have delivered to Oasis a written offer to alter the
terms or conditions of this Agreement during the Oasis Notice Period, the
Oasis Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or
modify the Oasis Board Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (after taking into
account such alterations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement);
provided that (x) __ the Company receives written notice from Oasis
confirming that the Oasis Board has determined to change its recommendation at
least five (5) __ Business Days in advance of the Oasis Board
Adverse Recommendation Change (the "Oasis Notice Period"), which notice shall
include a description in reasonable detail of the reasons for such Oasis Board
Adverse Recommendation Change, and written copies of any relevant
proposed transaction agreements with any party making a potential Superior
Offer, (y) __during any Oasis Notice Period, the Company shall be entitled to
deliver to Oasis one or more counterproposals to such Acquisition Proposal and
Oasis will, and cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Company in
good faith (to the extent the Company desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
applicable Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer and (z)
__ in the event of any material amendment to any Superior Offer (including
any revision in the amount, form or mix of consideration or percentage of the
combined company that Oasis stockholders would receive as a result of such
potential Superior Offer), Oasis shall be required to provide the Company with
notice of such material amendment and the Oasis Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least four (4) __ Business Days
remain in the Oasis Notice Period following such notification during which the
parties shall comply again with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(c)_ and
the Oasis Board shall not make an Oasis Board Adverse Recommendation
Change prior to the end of such Oasis Notice Period as so extended (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions).

 



76

    

(d) Oasiss obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Oasis Stockholder
Meeting in accordance with _Section 6.3(a)_ shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Superior Offer or Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or
modification of the Oasis Board Recommendation or any other Oasis Board
Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Oasis or the Oasis
Board from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided however, that any disclosure made by Oasis or the
Oasis Board pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) shall be limited to a
statement that Oasis is unable to take a position with respect to the bidders
tender offer unless the Oasis Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such statement would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

6.4 _Efforts; Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Party: (i) shall make all filings and other submissions (if any) and give
all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) reasonably required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such
Party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions or for such Contract to
remain in full force and effect, (iii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to lift any injunction prohibiting, or any other legal bar to, the
Contemplated Transactions and (iv) shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to satisfy the conditions precedent to the consummation of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file or otherwise submit, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all applications, notices,
reports and other documents reasonably required to be filed by such Party with
or otherwise submitted by such Party to any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any
additional information requested by any such Governmental Authority.

 

6.5 _Company Options_ _and Company Warrants_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_, at the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the 2015 Company Plan and each Extended Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
2014 Company Plan, whether or not vested, shall, without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become an option to
purchase Oasis Common Stock, and Oasis shall assume the Company Plans and each
such Company Option (with respect to the 2015 Company Plan) and each such
Extended Company Option (with respect to the 2014 Company Plan) in accordance
with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company
Plans and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company
Options assumed by Oasis shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect
to Oasis Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (i)
each Company Option assumed by Oasis may be exercised solely for shares of
Oasis Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Oasis Common Stock subject to
each Company Option assumed by Oasis shall be determined by multiplying (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject 

 



77

    

 to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Oasis Common Stock, (iii) __ the per share
exercise price for the Oasis Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Company Option assumed by Oasis shall be determined by dividing (A) __ the
per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) __ the
Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent and (iv) __ any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option
assumed by Oasis shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that: (A) __ to the
extent provided under the terms of a Company Option, such Company Option
assumed by Oasis in accordance with this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Oasis Common
Stock subsequent to the Effective Time and (B) __the Oasis Board or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option
assumed by Oasis after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.5(a)_ , the conversion of each Company Option
(regardless of whether such option qualifies as an "incentive stock option"
within the meaning of Section __422 of the Code) into an option to purchase
shares of Oasis Common Stock shall be made in a manner consistent with Section
__ 409A and 424 of the Code

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Non-Extended Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
2014 Company Plan, whether or not vested, shall, without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled without the payment of any
consideration.

 

(c) Oasis shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8, if available for use by
Oasis, relating to the shares of Oasis Common Stock issuable with respect to
Company Options assumed by Oasis in accordance with _Section 6.5(a)_ to the
extent such shares are eligible to be registered on Form S-8.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under Company Warrants shall be converted into rights with respect to Oasis
Common Stock and thereupon assumed by Oasis. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time: (i) each Company Warrant assumed by Oasis may be exercised
solely for shares of Oasis Common Stock; (ii) __ the number of shares
of Oasis Common Stock subject to each Company Warrant assumed by Oasis shall
be determined by multiplying (x) __ the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company Warrant (on an as-converted basis with
respect to shares of Company Preferred Stock), as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, by (y) __ the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Oasis Common
Stock; (iii) __the per share exercise price for the Oasis Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Company Warrant assumed by Oasis shall be
determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Warrant (or, in the case of Company Warrants
exercisable for shares of Company Preferred Stock, the exercise price per
share of such series of Company Preferred Stock divided by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock into which such share of Company Preferred
Stock is then convertible), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up
to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any
Company Warrant assumed by Oasis shall continue in full force and effect

 



78

    

 and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such
Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that: (A)
to the extent provided under the terms of a Company Warrant, such Company
Warrant assumed by Oasis in accordance with this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Oasis Common
Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; and (B) the Oasis Board or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility, if any, of the
Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Warrant
assumed by Oasis.

 

6.6 _Oasis Options_. Prior to the Closing, the Oasis Board shall have adopted
appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions necessary and
appropriate, including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary consent from the holder of an Oasis Option, to provide the
following:

 

(a) The vesting of each unexpired, unexercised and unvested Oasis Option shall
be accelerated in full effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

(b) Each unexpired and unexercised Oasis Option with an exercise price that
equals or exceeds the Oasis In-the-Money Price shall be canceled for no
consideration; and

 

(c) Each unexpired and unexercised Oasis Option with an exercise price that is
less than the Oasis In-the-Money Price shall continue to remain outstanding
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms.

 

6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as expressly provided herein or as consented to in writing by the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
from and after the Effective Time, Oasis shall assume and honor all Company
Employee Plans. For all purposes under Oasis Employee Plans
providing benefits to any employee who continues to be employed by either of
Oasis or the Company immediately following Closing (each a "Continuing
Employee"), and subject to applicable Law, each such Continuing Employee shall
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Employee Plans, as applicable, except (i) __ to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) __ with respect to
benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare
benefit plan or (iii) __ with respect to any Employee Plan for which prior
service is not taken into account for current employees of Oasis. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to any
applicable Law: (i) __ each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Oasis
Employee Plans, as applicable, which are welfare benefit plans to the extent
coverage under such Oasis Employee Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) __ for purposes of each Oasis
Employee Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Continuing Employee, Oasis shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Employee Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Oasis shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his

 



79

    

 or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Employee Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in
the corresponding Oasis Employee Plan begins to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Oasis Employee Plan.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) __ be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) __ limit the ability of the
Company to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) __ create any
third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any
employee) other than the parties to this Agreement or any right to employment
or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment
with Oasis or the Company, or (iv) __ limit the right of Oasis or the Company
to terminate the employment or service of any employee or other service
provider following the Closing Date at any time and for any or no reason.
Oasis and the Company shall cause Oasis to comply with the terms of any
employment, severance, retention, change of control, or similar agreement
specified on Section __ 4.17(c) of the Oasis Disclosure Schedule, subject to
the provisions of such agreements.

6.8 _Oasis Restricted Stock_ _Units_. Prior to the Closing, the Oasis Board
shall have adopted appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that (i) the vesting of each outstanding
and unvested Oasis Restricted Stock Unit shall be accelerated in
full effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, contingent on
the occurrence of the Closing and (ii) for each outstanding and unsettled
Oasis Restricted Stock Unit (including any Oasis Restricted Stock Units
accelerated under  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(i)_ above) the holder thereof shall
receive, immediately prior to the Effective Time a number of shares of Oasis
Common Stock equal to the number of vested and unsettled shares underlying
such Oasis Restricted Stock Units. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the tax withholding obligations for each holder receiving shares of
Oasis Common Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be
satisfied by Oasis withholding from issuance that number of shares of Oasis
Common Stock calculated by multiplying the maximum statutory withholding rate
for such holder in connection with such issuance by the number of shares of
Oasis Common Stock to be issued in accordance with the preceding sentence,
and rounding up to the nearest whole share and remitting such withholding in
cash to the appropriate taxing authorities.

6.9  _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, each of Oasis and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of Oasis or the Company, respectively (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,

Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any such person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to Oasis, to the extent
then required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately

of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or

in all respects the obligations of Oasis to its DandO Indemnified Parties as of

prepaid "DandO tail policy" for the non-cancellable extension of the directors

Agreement with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of Oasis by reason of him or her serving

matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall

Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

11.5  _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,

Transactions, each of the Parties: (a) irrevocably and unconditionally

any of such rights or obligations by such Party without the other Partys
prior written consent shall be void and of no effect.

and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by the other Party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to

11.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.

sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve,

herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and each of the Parties waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with
respect thereto. Each of the Parties further agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity.

 

11.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties and the DandO Indemnified Parties to the extent of their respective
rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.9_) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

WHEREAS, Oasis, Project Oasis Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Oasis (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company, have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (the

WHEREAS, each Stockholder beneficially owns and has sole or shared voting
power with respect to the number of Shares, and holds Oasis Options and/or

WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to the willingness of the Company
to enter into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder has agreed to enter into

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a condition to, the Companys
entering into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder, Oasis and the Company
agree as follows:

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Each Stockholder agrees that, prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 2_ below), at any meeting of
the stockholders of Oasis or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in
connection with any written consent of the stockholders of Oasis, with respect
to the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal, such
Stockholder shall:

(a) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares and any New Shares
(as defined in _Section_ __ _ 3_ below) to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of calculating a quorum;

 

(b) from and after the date hereof until the Expiration Date, vote (or cause
to be voted), or deliver a written consent (or cause a written consent to be
delivered) covering all of the Shares and any New Shares that Stockholder
shall be entitled to so vote: (i) in favor of (A) adoption and approval of the
issuance of the shares of Oasis Common Stock by virtue of the Merger and (B)
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and any matter
that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions; (ii) against any action or agreement that, to the
knowledge of Stockholder, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach
in any material respect of

   

 any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Oasis or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the Merger
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to Oasiss or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates obligations
under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled; (iii) against any Acquisition
Proposal, or any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to,
or would reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone,
discourage or materially and adversely affect the consummation of the Merger
and all of the other Contemplated Transactions; and (iv) to approve any
proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a later date, if there are not
sufficient votes for the adoption of the Merger Agreement on the date on which
such meeting is held. Stockholder shall not take or commit or agree to take
any action inconsistent with the foregoing.

2\. _Expiration Date_. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Expiration Date_

and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10_ thereof or otherwise, or (c) the mutual written agreement of the
parties to terminate this Agreement.

3\. _Additional Purchases_. Each Stockholder agrees that any shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of Oasis that such Stockholder purchases or

prior to the Expiration Date, whether by the exercise of any Oasis Options,
settlement of Oasis Restricted Stock Units or otherwise, including, without
limitation, by gift, succession, in the event of a stock split or as a
dividend or distribution of any Shares (" _New Shares_ "), shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted the Shares.

4.  _Agreement to Retain Shares_. From and after the date hereof until the
Expiration Date, each Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) sell,

limitation, by the creation of any Liens (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 5(c)_

Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or similar
arrangement with respect to such Shares or New Shares or grant any proxy or

into any Contract, option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, assignment or other
disposition of (including, without limitation, by the creation of any Liens)
any Shares or New Shares, or (d) take any action that would make any
representation or warranty of such Stockholder contained herein untrue or
incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling such Stockholder from
performing such Stockholders obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Stockholder may make (1) transfers by
will or by operation of Law or other transfers for estate-planning purposes,
in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (2) with respect to

force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement; _provided_ ,

willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to termination hereof.

 

13\. _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder shall, from time to time, execute

public communication that criticizes or disparages this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, without the prior
written consent of Oasis and the Company, _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not limit or affect any actions taken by such Stockholder (or any affiliated
officer or director of such Stockholder) that would be permitted to be taken
by such Stockholder, Oasis or the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not effect any actions of
Stockholder the prohibition of which would be prohibited under applicable Law.

writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by overnight
courier (providing proof of delivery), by facsimile transmission (providing

confirmation of transmission) set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 1_ attached hereto
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice).

 

16\. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term
or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

 

17\. _Assignability_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however_ , that neither
this Agreement nor any of a partys rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this
Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by such party without the other
partys prior written consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



7

    

18\. _No Waivers_. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by the
Company or Oasis to such Stockholder shall be construed as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of the Company or Oasis, as applicable, with respect to any
other stockholder of Oasis who has executed an agreement substantially in the
form of this Agreement with respect to Shares held or subsequently held by
such stockholder or with respect to any subsequent breach of Stockholder or
any other such stockholder of Oasis. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any
party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such
party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
provision hereof by such party.

19.  _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the state of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts

arising out of this Agreement, any document executed in connection herewith
and the matters contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

21\. _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a Contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Oasis Board

and regulations and any applicable provision of the certificate of
incorporation of Oasis, the Merger Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto, and

follows:

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Each Stockholder agrees that, prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in  _Section_ __ _ 2_ below), at any meeting of
the stockholders of the Company or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or
in connection with any written consent of the stockholders (or any class or
series of stockholders, as applicable) of the Company, with respect to the
Merger, the Merger Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal, such Stockholder
shall:

 

(a) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares and any New Shares
(as defined in _Section_ __ _ 3_ below) to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of calculating a quorum;

(b) from and after the date hereof until the Expiration Date, vote (or cause
to be voted), or deliver a written consent (or cause a written consent to be

shall be entitled to so vote: (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and approval of the Merger and any matter that could reasonably be
expected to facilitate the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions; (ii)
against any action or agreement that, to the knowledge of Stockholder,
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach in any material respect of
any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the Merger
Agreement that would reasonably be

   

 expected to result in any of the conditions to the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates obligations under the Merger Agreement not being
fulfilled; (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal, or any agreement,
transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be
expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially
and adversely affect the consummation of the Merger and all of the other
Contemplated Transactions; (iv) to approve any proposal to adjourn or postpone
the meeting to a later date, if there are not sufficient votes for the

" shall mean the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) such date
and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10_ thereof or otherwise, or (c) the mutual written agreement of the
parties to terminate this Agreement.

Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date, whether by the exercise of any
Company Options, Company Warrants or otherwise, including, without limitation,
by gift, succession, in the event of a stock split or as a dividend
or distribution of any Shares (" _New Shares_ "), shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted the Shares.

 

4\. _Agreement to Retain Shares_. From and after the date hereof until the
Expiration Date, each Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a)

with respect to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, assignment or other
disposition of (including, without limitation, by the creation of any Liens)

or by operation of Law or other transfers for estate-planning purposes, in
which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (2) with respect to such

force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement; _provided_ ,

willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to termination hereof.

 

13\. _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder shall, from time to time, execute

counsel. Prior to the Closing, each Stockholder shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, make any press release, public announcement or other
public communication that criticizes or disparages this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, without the prior
written consent of Oasis and the Company, _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not limit or affect any actions taken by such Stockholder (or any affiliated
officer or director of such Stockholder) that would be permitted to be taken
by such Stockholder, Oasis or the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not effect any actions of
any Stockholder the prohibition of which would be prohibited under applicable
Law.

15.  _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by overnight
courier (providing proof of delivery), by facsimile transmission (providing
confirmation of transmission) or by electronic transmission (providing
confirmation of transmission) to the Company or Oasis, as the case may be, in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ of the Merger Agreement and to each
Stockholder at his, her or its address or email address (providing
confirmation of transmission) set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 1_ attached hereto
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice).

 

16\. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term
or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

 

17\. _Assignability_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however_ , that neither
this Agreement nor any of a partys rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this
Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by such party without the other
partys prior written consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



7

    

18\. _No Waivers_. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by the
Company or Oasis to such Stockholder shall be construed as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of the Company or Oasis, as applicable, with respect to any
other stockholder of the Company who has executed an agreement substantially
in the form of this Agreement with respect to Shares held or subsequently
held by such stockholder or with respect to any subsequent breach of
Stockholder or any other such stockholder of the Company. No waiver of any
provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 

19\. _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the state of Delaware, regardless
of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of Laws. In any action or Legal Proceeding between any of the
parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, each of the parties: (i)

trial by jury with respect to any action or Legal Proceeding related to or
arising out of this Agreement, any document executed in connection herewith
and the matters contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

21\. _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a Contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Company

and regulations and any applicable provision of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, the Merger Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto, and

matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed

receive in the future shares of Oasis Common Stock settled in Oasis Common
Stock that would otherwise expire during the Restricted Period, provided that
reasonable notice shall be provided to Oasis prior to any such filing).

Any attempted transfer in violation of this Lock-Up Agreement will be of no
effect and null and void, regardless of whether the purported transferee has
any actual or constructive knowledge of the transfer restrictions set forth
in this Lock-Up Agreement, and will not be recorded on the share register of
Oasis. In furtherance of the foregoing, the undersigned agrees that Oasis and
any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the
securities described herein are hereby authorized to decline to make any
transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach
of this Lock-Up Agreement. Oasis may cause the legend set forth below, or a
legend substantially equivalent thereto, to be placed upon any certificate(s)
or other documents, ledgers or instruments evidencing the undersigneds
ownership of Oasis Common Stock:

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO AND MAY ONLY BE
TRANSFERRED IN COMPLIANCE WITH A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE
AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full
power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement. All authority herein
conferred or agreed to be conferred and any obligations of the undersigned
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs or personal
representatives of the undersigned.

The undersigned understands that if the Merger Agreement is terminated for
any reason, the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this
Lock-Up Agreement. The undersigned understands that Oasis and the Company are
proceeding with the Contemplated Transactions in reliance upon this Lock-Up
Agreement.

Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon Oasis or the Company will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity, and the exercise by Oasis or the Company of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The undersigned

Form of Funding Agreement

   

FUNDING AGREEMENT

 

THIS FUNDING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of April 28, 2020 by and
among Adicet Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), resTORbio,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Oasis"), and the investors listed on _Schedule_
__ _ A_ hereto under the heading "Investors", each of which is herein
referred to as an "Investor."

 

WHEREAS, (i) immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Oasis will be executing an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as
amended, modified or restated from time to time, the "Merger Agreement") with
a newly created, wholly owned subsidiary of Oasis ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Oasis (the "Merger") and (ii) as a condition to the Merger and
material inducement for the parties to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
parties desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to which the Investors
are agreeing, subject to and contingent upon the closing of the Merger (the
"Merger Closing"), to deposit certain funds into escrow immediately prior to
the Merger Closing to be invested into securities of Oasis or released in
accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement (as defined below).

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained in this Agreement, the Company and the Investors hereby agree as
follows:

1\. _Agreement to Fund_.

 

1.1 _Funding_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Investor agrees, severally and not jointly, to fund, or to cause an
Affiliated Entity (as defined below) to fund, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds into the Escrow Account (as defined below) at the Closing (as
defined below) the amount set forth opposite such Investors name on 
_Schedule_ __ _ A_ hereto (the "Funding Amount" for such Investor and the
aggregate Funding Amount set forth on _Schedule A_ , the "Total Funding
Amount") (the "Funding"). Any such Affiliated Entity that funds a Funding
Amount shall, as a condition to such funding, execute a counterpart signature
page hereto and to the Escrow Agreement and shall thereafter be deemed an
Investor hereunder. An "Affiliated Entity" of any individual, corporation,
partnership, trust, limited liability company, association or other entity
("Person") shall include any Person who or that, directly or indirectly,
controls, is controlled by, or is under common management or control with
such Person, including without limitation any general partner, officer,
director, trustee, managing member or manager of such Person and any venture
capital fund or registered investment company now or hereafter existing that
is controlled by or under common control with one or more general partners,
managing members or investment advisers of, or that shares the same management
company or investment advisor with, such Person.

 

1.2 _Closing_. The Funding shall take place immediately prior to Merger
Closing or at such other time and place as the Company, Oasis and Investors
obligated to fund in the aggregate two-thirds or more of the Total Funding
Amount (the "Requisite Pre-Closing Investors") mutually agree upon (which
time and place are designated as the "Closing").

   

1.3 _Escrow_. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing,
each party shall use its best efforts to: (a) select an escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent") that is mutually acceptable to the Company, Oasis and the
Requisite Pre-Closing Investors (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (b) other than the Company, enter into
an escrow agreement on customary terms reflecting the terms of this Agreement
(as amended, modified or restated form time to time, the "Escrow Agreement")
that is mutually acceptable to the Company, Oasis and the Requisite Pre-
Closing Investors (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) to establish an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") into
which the Funding Amounts will be deposited at the Closing.

1.4  _Qualified Financing_.

(a) In the event that, after the Merger Closing, Oasis sells shares of its
common stock (the "Oasis Common Stock") to one or more new or existing
investors for aggregate gross proceeds to Oasis (when taken together with the
funds released from the Escrow Account) of at least $30,000,000 (such amount,
the "Qualified Financing Threshold", and such financing, a "Qualified
Financing") within twelve (12) months of the Merger Closing, then all amounts
then in the Escrow Account shall be released to Oasis (other than as provided
below) to subscribe for shares of Oasis Common Stock in a private placement
transaction (the "Concurrent Private Placement") that shall occur
simultaneously (the "Concurrent Private Placement Closing") with the
initial closing of the Qualified Financing and on the same economic
conditions (including the price per share paid by other investors in the
Qualified Financing (the "Per Share Price")) and similar other terms and
conditions as set forth in the Qualified Financing and consistent with the
terms and conditions set forth herein, with the number of shares of Oasis
Common Stock (the "Shares") issued to each Investor as a result of the
foregoing being such Investors applicable portion of the Escrow Account
divided by the Per Share Price rounded down to the nearest whole share and any
excess amount for any Investor resulting from fractional shares being released
to such Investor; provided, however, that the Qualified Financing Threshold
may be waived by Investors that funded in the aggregate two-thirds or more of
the Total Funding Amount (the "Requisite Post-Closing Investors");
provided, further, that the Concurrent Private Placement Closing shall be
delayed for any HSR Investor (as defined below), and the applicable portion of
the Escrow Account for such HSR Investor shall not be released to Oasis, until
such time as any applicable waiting periods, approvals, or clearances related
to the consummation of the Concurrent Private Financing and/or Qualified
Financing for such HSR Investor under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR Act") or any other applicable antitrust or
competition law shall have expired, been terminated or been obtained. An "HSR
Investor" means any Investor who is required to make a filing under the HSR
Act or any other applicable antitrust or competition law in connection with
the Concurrent Private Placement and/or the Qualified Financing.

(b) In connection with the release of funds and subscription pursuant to
Section 1.4(a), (i) each Investor and Oasis agree to instruct the Escrow Agent
to release funds to the applicable party in accordance with the terms of
Section 1.4(a) and the Escrow Agreement and (ii) each Investor agrees (A) to
execute and deliver to Oasis all applicable transaction documents that are to
be executed in the Concurrent Private Placement (which shall have terms and
conditions substantially similar to those provided to other investors in the
Qualified Financing, other than adjustments if the Qualified Financing is a
public offering for the fact that the Concurrent Private Placement is a
private placement, and which shall include the registration rights
provided for in Section 1.4(c) below), thereby agreeing to be bound by all
obligations and receive all rights thereunder.

 



2

    

(c) If the Qualified Financing is a public offering, Oasis shall grant
customary registration rights to the Investors with respect to the shares
issued in the Concurrent Private Placement, including, without limitation,
customary liquidated damages payable by Oasis in the event of a failure to
timely register the Shares or to obtain effectiveness of the registration
statement. If the Qualified Financing is a private placement, Oasis shall
grant the Investors the same registration rights with respect to the shares
issued as to other investors in such private placement. 

1.5 _Release of Funds_. To the extent occurring prior to the consummation of a
Qualified Financing, all funds in the Escrow Account shall be released to the
Investors, in proportion to their respective Funding Amounts contributed to
the Escrow Account, upon the earliest to occur of (each a "Release Event"):
(a) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Merger Closing, (b) an Oasis
Change of Control (as defined below), (c) a suspension of trading in, or
delisting of, Oasiss Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market or (d) Oasis
filing any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency or moratorium law or any other law for the relief
of, or relating to, debtors, now or hereafter in effect, or makes any
assignment for the benefit of creditors. An "Oasis Change of Control" means
any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (i) any merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of
securities, acquisition of securities, reorganization, recapitalization,
tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction: (A) in which Oasis
is a constituent entity, (B) in which a Person or "group" (as defined in the
Exchange Act (as defined below) and the rules promulgated thereunder) of
Persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of
securities representing more than 50% of the outstanding securities of any
class of voting securities of Oasis or (C) in which Oasis issues securities
representing more than 50% of the outstanding securities of any class of
voting securities of Oasis; or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer,
license, acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses or assets
that constitute or account for 50% or more of the consolidated book value or
the fair market value of the assets of Oasis and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

2\. _Representations and Warranties of the_ _Parties_. Each party hereby
represents and warrants to the other parties that, as of the date of this
Agreement:

 

2.1 _Organization, Good Standing_. Such party is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and authority to
enter into and perform this Agreement and to carry out the transactions
required to be performed by it pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.2 _Authorization_. All action on the part of such party, its officers,
directors, managers, partners and equityholders necessary for
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
performance of all obligations of such party hereunder occurring at or prior
to the Closing has been taken or will be taken prior to the Closing. This
Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of such party,
enforceable against such party in accordance with their respective terms,
except (a) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors rights generally or (b) as limited by laws relating to the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies.

 



3

    

2.3 _Consents_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor
the performance of all obligations of such party hereunder occurring at or
prior to the Closing, violates any statute, regulation, rule, injunction,
judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge or other restriction of any
government, governmental agency, or court to which such party is subject, or
conflicts with, violates or constitutes a default (or gives rise to any right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any agreement or other
instrument or understanding to which such party is a party or is otherwise
bound (other than has been waived thereunder). No authorization, consent,
approval or other order of, or declaration or notice to or filing with, any
governmental agency or body or other entity, organization or individual
is required for the valid authorization, execution, delivery and performance
of all obligations of such party hereunder occurring at or prior to the
Closing, except for such filing(s) pursuant to applicable securities laws as
may be necessary, which filings will be timely effected.

3\. _Additional Representations and Warranties of Oasis_. Oasis hereby further
represents and warrants to the Company and each Investor that, as of the date
of this Agreement:

3.1 _SEC Filings_. Oasis has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely
basis all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), since January 1, 2018 (the "Oasis SEC Documents"). As of
the time it was filed with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), each of
the Oasis SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (as the case may be)
and as of the time they were filed, none of the Oasis SEC Documents contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The certifications and statements required by (i) Rule 13a-14
under the Exchange Act and (ii) 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) relating to the Oasis SEC Documents are accurate and complete and
comply as to form and content with all applicable Laws. As used in this
Section 3.1, the term "file" and variations thereof shall be broadly
construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

 

3.2 _Financial Statements_. The financial statements (including any related
notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Oasis SEC Documents: (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that

to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are not reasonably expected
to be material in amount) applied on a consistent

 



4

    

 basis unless otherwise noted therein throughout the periods indicated and
(iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of
Oasis as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows of Oasis for the periods covered thereby. Other than as expressly
disclosed in the Oasis SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, there has
been no material change in Oasiss accounting methods or principles that
would be required to be disclosed in Oasiss financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. The books of account and other financial records of
Oasis and each of its Subsidiaries are true and complete in all material
respects. 

4\. _Additional Investment Representations and Warranties of the Investors_.
Each Investor, severally but not jointly, hereby further represents and
warrants to the Company and Oasis that, as of the date of this Agreement:

4.1 _Purchase Entirely for Own Account_. The Funding Amount is being
invested, and any Shares are being acquired, for investment for such
Investors own account not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the
resale or distribution of any part thereof, and such Investor has no present
intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing
the same and such Investor does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement
or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to
such person or to any third person, with respect to the foregoing.

4.2 _Disclosure of Information_. Such Investor has received a copy of the
Merger Agreement and has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive
answers from the Company and Oasis regarding the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the terms and conditions
of the Merger and Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
and the business, properties, prospects and financial condition of the Company
and Oasis. With respect to any projections of its future operations provided
to the Investors by the Company or Oasis (including, without limitation, any
projections regarding the operations of the combined companies following the
Merger), such Investor acknowledges that neither the Company nor Oasis makes
any representations or warranties.

 

4.3 _Investment Experience_. Such Investor is an investor in securities of
companies in the development stage and acknowledges that it is able to fend
for itself, can bear the economic risk of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any investment in the Shares, and has such knowledge and
experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any investment in the Shares. Such Investor acknowledges that this
Agreement and any acquisition of Shares involves a high degree of risk, and
represents that it is able, without materially impairing its financial
condition, to undertake the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
hold any Shares for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss
of its investment.

 

4.4 _Accredited Investor_. Such Investor (other than any Investor indicated on
Schedule A as a "Regulation S Investor") is an "accredited investor" within
the meaning of SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect; solely
with respect to any Investor indicated on Schedule A as a "Regulation S
Investor", such Investor certifies that such Investor (a) is not a "U.S.
person" within the meaning of SEC Rule 902 of Regulation S, as presently in
effect, and that such Investor is not acquiring the Shares for the account or
benefit of any such U.S. person, (b) agrees to resell the Shares only in
accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under
the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from registration
and agrees not to engage in hedging transactions with regard to such Shares
unless in compliance with the Securities Act, (c) agrees that Oasis is hereby
required to refuse to register any transfer of any Shares issued to such
Investor not made in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant
to registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available
exemption from registration and (d) agrees that any certificates or book
entries for any Shares issued to such Investor shall contain the following
legend:

 

THE TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES IS PROHIBITED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PROVISIONS OF REGULATION S AS PROMULGATED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"),
PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT, OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION, AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE SECURITIES
(INCLUDING ANY SWAP OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION THAT TRANSFERS,
IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF
OWNERSHIP OF THESE SECURITIES, WHETHER ANY SUCH SWAP, AGREEMENT OR TRANSACTION
IS TO BE SETTLED BY DELIVERY OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THESE SECURITIES OR ANY
OTHER SECURITIES, IN CASH OR OTHERWISE), MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT.

 



5

    

4.5 _Restricted Securities_. Such Investor understands that the Shares that
may be issued to such Investor in the Concurrent Private Placement will be
characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws
inasmuch as they will be acquired from Oasis in a transaction not involving a
public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such
securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only in
certain limited circumstances. In this connection, such Investor represents
that it is familiar with SEC Rule 144, as presently in effect, and
understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.
Such Investor understands that the Shares, when issued, will not be registered
under the Securities Act and have not been and will not be registered or
qualified in any state in which they are offered, and thus the Investor will
not be able to resell or otherwise transfer his, her or its Shares unless they
are registered under the Securities Act and registered or qualified
under applicable state securities laws, or an exemption from such
registration or qualification is available. Such Investor has no immediate
need for liquidity in connection with this investment, does not anticipate
that the Investor will be required to sell his, her or its Shares, once
acquired, in the foreseeable future.

4.6 _Reliance by Company_ _and Oasis_. Such Investor understands that the
representations, warranties, covenants and acknowledgements set forth in this
Section 4 constitute a material inducement to the Company and Oasis entering
into this Agreement.

 

4.7 _Foreign Investors_. If such Investor is not a United States person (as
defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended), such Investor hereby represents that it has satisfied itself as to
the full observance of the laws of its jurisdiction applicable to such
Investor in connection with any invitation to fund its Funding Amount, acquire
the Shares or any use of this Agreement, including (i) the legal requirements
within its jurisdiction for the Funding and purchase of the Shares, (ii) any
foreign exchange restrictions applicable to such Funding or purchase, (iii)
any governmental or other consents that may need to be obtained, and (iv) the
income tax and other tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the
Funding, the Escrow Account or the purchase, holding, redemption, sale, or
transfer of the Shares. Such Investors funding of its Funding Amount or
subscription and payment for and continued beneficial ownership of the Shares
will not violate any applicable securities or other laws of such Investors
jurisdiction applicable to such Investor.

4.8 _Residence_. If such Investor is an individual, then such Investor resides
in the state or province identified in the address of such Investor set forth
on the signature pages hereto; if such Investor is a partnership, corporation,
limited liability company or other entity, then the office or offices of such
Investor in which its principal place of business is identified in the
address or addresses of such Investor set forth on the signature pages hereto.

4.9 _No Reliance on Others_. Such Investor acknowledges that (a) such
Investor has negotiated this Agreement on an arms-length basis and has had an
opportunity to consult with its legal, tax and financial advisors concerning
this Agreement and its subject matter, (b) the purchase price payable for the
Shares will represent a negotiated price that Investor will have no control
over, may be a higher price than the then current fair market value of a share
of Oasis Common Stock and may not reflect the fair market value of the Shares
at the time of issuance and such Investor may have no control over the terms
of any Qualified Financing or Concurrent Private Placement, (c) such Investor
has independently and without reliance upon any other Investor, the Company,
Oasis or any of their respective owners, employees, officers, directors,
affiliates, agents or other representatives, and based on such

 



6

    

 information and the advice of such advisors as such Investor has deemed
appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement,
(d) none of any other Investor, the Company, Oasis or any of their respective
owners, employees, officers, directors, affiliates, agents or other
representatives: (i) is acting as a fiduciary or financial or investment
adviser to such party, and none of such parties has given such party any
investment advice, opinion or other information on whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are prudent, (ii) has made (and such party is
not relying on) any representation or warranty, express or implied,
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
other than those set forth in this Agreement and (iii) has at any time had any
duty to such party to disclose any information relating to the Company, Oasis,
their respective businesses, or financial condition or relating to any other
matters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(e) such Investor has consulted with such partys own advisors with respect to
the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any future subscription,
ownership, transfer or sale of the Shares to the extent such Investor has
determined it necessary to protect such Investors own interest in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in view of such
Investors prior financial experience and present financial condition and
expressly acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company, Oasis or any of
their respective owners, employees, officers, directors, affiliates, agents or
other representatives, makes any representation to such party with respect to
the tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
future subscription, ownership, transfer or sale of the Shares. Such Investor
shall be solely responsible for the payment of any and all income, transfer
and other taxes, filing and recording fees and similar charges incurred
by such party relating to the transactions contemplated herein.

default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any

notice of the new address in the manner set forth above.

 

7.12 _Expenses_. Irrespective of whether the Closing is effected, each party

11

    

7.15 _Further Assurances_. Each Investor, Oasis and the Company shall from
time to time and at all times hereafter make, do, execute, or cause or

7.16 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and no party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any
manner by any warranties, representations or covenants except as specifically
set forth herein or therein.

 

7.17 _Funding Backstop_. To the extent any Investor (directly or through an
Affiliated Entity) fails to fund its Funding Amount at the Closing (such
amount, a "Funding Deficiency"), or provides notice of its intent to do so
(each such investor, a "Defaulting Investor"), Oasis shall promptly (and in
any event within two (2) days) deliver a written notice (the "Funding
Notice") to each other Investor which has not so failed to fund or provided
notice of its intent to do so (each a "Funding Investor") of the foregoing,
specifying the identity of the Defaulting Investor(s) and the aggregate
Funding Deficiency. Each Funding Investor shall, subject to the provisions of
this Section 7.17, have an additional option to fund (directly or through an
Affiliated Entity) all or any part of any Funding Deficiency. To exercise
such option, a Funding Investor must deliver written notice notifying the
Company and Oasis that such Investor (directly or through an Affiliated
Entity) intends to exercise its option to fund all or any portion of the
Funding Deficiency within five (5) business days after the date of the Funding
Notice. In the event there are two (2) or more such Funding Investors that
choose to exercise such option for a total amount greater than the
Deficiency Amount, such amounts shall be allocated to each such Funding
Investor pro rata based on the additional amounts such Funding Investors have
elected to fund (directly or through an Affiliated Entity) pursuant to this
Section 7.17. For purposes of clarity, the funding of any Funding Deficiency
by other Investors (directly or through an Affiliated Entity) pursuant to this
Section 7.17 shall not relieve any Defaulting Investor of any liability to the
other parties hereunder for its breach of this Agreement or otherwise.

7.18 _Additional Investors;_ _Unallocated Portion; Reallocation_. As of the
date of this Agreement, a portion of the Total Funding Amount is unallocated
among the Investors as indicated on _Schedule A_ (the "Unallocated Portion").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including Section
7.13), the Company may, without any consent or action required from any other
party hereto, and in its sole discretion, do either or both of the following
with respect to the Unallocated Portion prior to Closing: (a) permit one
or more additional existing stockholders of the Company or any Affiliated
Entity of the foregoing to each become a party to this Agreement as an
Investor hereunder, with any such partys Funding Amount consisting of all or
any portion of the then remaining Unallocated Portion as agreed upon with the
Company, by having such party execute and deliver a counterpart signature page
to this Agreement (a "New Investor"), or (b) increase the Funding Amount of
any Investor by all or any portion of the then remaining Unallocated Portion
if such Investor so agrees to increase such

 



12

    

 Investors Funding Amount (an "Increased Allocation"). Neither the Company
nor Oasis shall have any obligation to offer the Unallocated Portion to any
Investor or to offer any Unallocated Portion pro rata among Investors. Any
New Investor that executes and delivers a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement shall be deemed an "Investor" for all purposes hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including Section
7.13), _Schedule A_ hereto may be amended by the Company after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing without the consent or approval of any
other party to add or adjust information regarding any New Investor or
Increased Allocation in accordance with this Section 7.18. The Company shall
provide prompt written notice of any adjustment to Schedule A pursuant to this
Section 7.18 to Oasis.

 

7.19 _Independent Nature of Investors  Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Investor hereunder are several and not joint with the
obligations of any other Investor, and no Investor shall be responsible in any
way for the performance of the obligations of any other Investor hereunder.
The decision of each Investor to fund its Funding Amount pursuant hereto has
been made by such Investor independently of any other Investor and
independently of any information, materials, statements or opinions as to the
business, affairs, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, results of
operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Oasis which
may have been made or given by any other Investor or by any agent or employee
of any other Investor, and no Investor and none of its agents or employees
shall have any liability to any other Investor (or any other person) relating
to or arising from any such information, materials, statements or opinions.
Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any Investor pursuant hereto,
shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association,
a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the
Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such
obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Investor shall
be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including
without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not
be necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

2\. _CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_.

 

2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive contingent
cash payments pursuant to this Agreement. The initial Holders will be the
holders of Oasis Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
One CVR will be issued with respect to each share of Oasis Common Stock that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, those shares of Oasis Common Stock issued upon
settlement of Oasis Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 6.8 of the
Merger Agreement).

 

2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. The CVRs will not
be listed on any quotation system or traded on any securities exchange.

 

2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address; CVR Distribution_.

 

(a) The CVRs will be issued in book-entry form only and will not be evidenced
by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall create and maintain a CVR Register for the purpose
of registering CVRs and Permitted Transfers. The CVR Register will be
created, and CVRs will be distributed, pursuant to written instructions to the
Rights Agent from the Holders Representative. The CVR Register will initially
show one position for Cede and Co. representing shares of Oasis Common Stock
held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of the shares of Oasis Common
Stock held by such holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Rights Agent will have no responsibility whatsoever directly to the street
name holders with respect to transfers of CVRs. With respect to any payments
to be made under Section 2.4 below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the
payment to any former street name holders of shares Oasis Common Stock by
sending one lump-sum payment to DTC. The Rights Agent will have no
responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the distribution of payments by DTC
to such street name holders.

 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights
Agent pursuant to its guidelines, including a guaranty of signature by an "
_eligible guarantor institution_ " that is a member or participant in the
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, duly executed by the Holder
thereof, the Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders
personal representative or the Holders survivor, and setting forth in
reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of

 



\- 8 -

    

 such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including the provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CVRs
in the CVR Register. Parent and Rights Agent may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or governmental charge that is
imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent
shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of this
Agreement that requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable
taxes or charges unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such
taxes or charges have been paid. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the
CVR Register will be the valid obligations of Parent and will entitle the
transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held
immediately prior to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR will
be valid until registered in the CVR Register.

 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the
CVR Register. The Holders Representative may make a written request to the
Rights Agent for a list containing the names, addresses and number of CVRs of
the Holders that are registered in the CVR Register. Upon receipt of such
written request from the Holders Representatives, the Rights Agent shall
promptly deliver a copy of such list to the Holders Representative.

(e) Holders Representative will provide written instructions to the Rights
Agent for the distribution of CVRs to holders of Oasis Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Record Time_ "). Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Parents prompt confirmation
of the Effective Time, the Rights Agent shall effect the distribution of the
CVRs, less any applicable tax withholding, to each holder of Oasis Common
Stock as of the Record Time by the mailing of a statement of holding
reflecting such CVRs.

2.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each CVR Payment Period during the
CVR Term, commencing with the first CVR Payment Period in which Parent or its
Affiliate receives Gross Consideration, Parent shall deliver to the Holders
Representative and Rights Agent a CVR Payment Statement for such CVR Payment
Period. Concurrent with the delivery of each CVR Payment Statement, on the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall pay the Rights Agent in
U.S. dollars an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the Net Proceeds
(if any) for the applicable CVR Payment Period. For further clarity, any sale
of CVR Products by Partner will not be included in Gross Consideration or Net
Proceeds, and Parent shall not be obligated to make any payments to the Rights
Agent regarding any proceeds based on such sales (it being understood that
payments made by Partner to Parent or its Affiliates based on such sales will
be included in Gross Consideration). Such amount of Net Proceeds will be
transferred by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Rights Agent not less than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the date of the applicable payment. In the event that
any Party determines that the calculation of Net Proceeds for a CVR Payment
Period deviates from the amounts previously reported to the Rights Agent for
any reason (such as, on account of additional amounts collected or product
returns), Parent and the Rights Agent shall reasonably cooperate to reconcile
any such deviations to the extent necessary under applicable legal or
financial reporting requirements.

 



\- 9 -

    

(b) The Rights Agent shall be solely responsible for the delivery of CVR
Payment Statements and CVR Payments to each Holder, and Parent shall not have
any responsibility or liability therefor. The Rights Agent shall promptly, and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a CVR Payment
Statement under Section 2.4(a), send each Holder at its registered address a
copy of such statement. If the Rights Agent also receives any CVR Payment,
then within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of each CVR Payment, the
Rights Agent shall also pay to each Holder, by check mailed to the address of
each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of business on
the date of the receipt of the CVR Payment Statement, such Holders Payment
Amount.

 

(c) All payments under this Agreement shall be made without any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any tax or similar governmental charge or
levy, except as required by applicable law and as set forth in this Section
2.4(c). The Parties shall cooperate with one another and use reasonable
efforts to minimize under applicable law obligations for any and all income or
other taxes required by applicable law to be withheld or deducted from any
payments made under this Agreement (" _Withholding Taxes_ "). Parent shall, if
required by applicable law, deduct or cause to be deducted from any amounts
required to be paid under this Agreement an amount equal to such Withholding
Taxes; provided that (i) Parent shall instruct the Rights Agent to solicit
from each Holder an IRS Form W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8 at such time or
times as is necessary to permit any payment under this Agreement to be made
without U.S. federal backup withholding, and (ii) in the event Parent becomes
aware that a payment under this Agreement is subject to Withholding Taxes
(other than U.S. federal backup withholding), Parent shall instruct the Rights
Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of such
Withholding Taxes to the applicable Holders prior to paying such Withholding
Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that notice has been provided
to an applicable Holder pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, no further notice shall be required to be given for any future
payments of such Withholding Tax. Such Withholding Taxes shall be paid to the
proper taxing authority for the applicable Holders account and, if available,
evidence of such payment shall be secured and sent to the Rights Agent within
thirty (30) days of such payment. Parent shall, at the Rights Agents sole
cost and expense, as mutually agreed by the Parties, do all such lawful acts
and things and sign all such lawful deeds and documents as the Rights Agent
may reasonably request to enable Parent and the applicable Holders to avail
themselves of any applicable legal provision or any double taxation treaties
with the goal of paying the sums due to the Rights Agent hereunder without
deducting any Withholding Taxes.

2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent_.

 

(a) The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 

(b) The CVRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or
in any constituent company to the Merger. It is hereby acknowledged and
agreed that a CVR shall not constitute a security of Parent.

 



\- 10 -

    

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon
any Holder, by virtue of the CVRs, any rights or obligations of any kind or
nature whatsoever as a stockholder or member of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, either at law or in equity. The
rights of any Holder and the obligations of Parent and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors and controlling Persons are contract
rights limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

(d) Each Holder acknowledges and agrees to the appointment and authority of
the Holders Representative to act as the exclusive representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact of such Holder and all Holders as set forth in this
Agreement. Each Holder agrees that such Holder will not challenge or contest
any action, inaction, determination or decision of the Holders Representative
or the authority or power of the Holders Representative and will not
threaten, bring, commence, institute, maintain, prosecute or voluntarily aid
any action, which challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation
of any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
provisions related to the authority of the Holders Representative to act on
behalf of such Holder and all Holders as set forth in this Agreement.

3\. _THE RIGHTS AGENT_.

 

3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. The Rights Agent shall not have any
liability for any actions taken or not taken in connection with this
Agreement, except to the extent of its willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence (in each case as determined by a final, non-appealable decision of
a court of competent jurisdiction). Parent and its Affiliates will not have
any liability for acts or omissions by the Rights Agent in connection with
this Agreement.

3.2  _Limitation on Duties and Responsibilities of Rights Agent_. The Rights
Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or
obligations will be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent. In
addition, the Rights Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility in the
case of the receipt of any written demand from any Holder with respect to any
action or default by Parent, including, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, any duty or responsibility to initiate or attempt to initiate
any proceedings at law or otherwise or to make any demand upon Parent.

 

3.3 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent specifying a date when such resignation will take effect, which
notice will be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to the date so specified.

notice specifying a date when such removal will take effect. Such notice
of removal will be given by Parent to the Rights Agent, which notice will be
sent at least thirty (30) days prior to the date so specified.

 

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign, is removed or
becomes incapable of acting, Parent shall as soon as is reasonably possible
appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent who shall be a stock transfer agent
of national reputation or the corporate trust department of a commercial bank.
The successor Rights Agent so appointed will, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment in accordance with Section 3.4, become the successor

\- 11 -

    

(c) Parent shall give written notice of each resignation and each removal of a
Rights Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent to the Holders
Representative who has the obligation to notify each Holder as their names and
addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice will include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to send such notice
within ten days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Rights Agent,
the successor Rights Agent will cause the notice to be mailed.

 

3.4 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_. Every successor Rights Agent
appointed hereunder will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to
the retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor Rights Agent,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent will execute
and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent all the
rights (except such rights of predecessor rights agent which survive pursuant
to Section 3.3 of this Agreement), powers and trusts of the retiring Rights
Agent.

4.  _COVENANTS_.

4.1 _List of Holders_. Parent shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the

Agent and the Holders Representative, terminate this Agreement without
liability, whereupon Parent shall be relieved of any and all obligations
contained herein. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
Parent anticipates that the total fees and expenses reasonably necessary to
conduct the CVR Clinical Trial(s) will exceed, in the aggregate, the Clinical
Trial Cap, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to promptly notify the Rights
Agent and the Holders Representative in writing.

 



\- 12 -

Regulatory Authority requires or requests additional testing or
information beyond that which is in the possession and control of Parent

prior to the applicable due date.

4.3 _CVR Commercial Agreement_.

shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to, through September 30, 2021, reasonably support Finder pursuant to the
Finder Agreement in Finders efforts to identify one or more Partners and
negotiate and complete a CVR Commercial Agreement with such Partner for the
Commercialization of the CVR Product by Partner in one or more countries or
regions in the world. Parent shall have no obligation to enter into any
agreement for the Commercialization of the CVR Product that is not a CVR
Commercial Agreement or to commit the use, in connection with its activities
under this Section 4.3(a), of more than the budgeted FTE(s) specified for such
activities in the Budget.

 

(b) Parent has no obligation to support Finder after September 30, 2021. If a

not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to: (i) amend any CVR Commercial
Agreement, or waive any right thereunder if such amendment or waiver
materially and adversely affects the rights of the Holders to receive the CVR

\- 13 -

    

 consents to each such amendment or waiver, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned; (ii) assign any CVR Commercial Agreement
without the consent of the Holders Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, unless such assignee agrees to
assume all obligations under, and agrees to be bound in writing to the terms
of, the CVR Commercial Agreement and this Agreement; or (iii) intentionally
take any action for the principal purpose of reducing the amount of CVR
Payment Amounts payable under this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent

against Partner or take any legal action against Partner in the event of an
actual or alleged breach by Partner of the CVR Commercial Agreement.

prior written consent of the Holders Representative, other than to (i)
contract research, contract manufacturing and similar service providers

sufficient detail to permit the Rights Agent to confirm the accuracy of the
payments due hereunder. The Rights Agent or the Holders Representative shall
each have the right to cause an independent internationally
recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent to audit such
records for the sole purpose of confirming payments for a period covering not
more than the preceding three (3) years. Parent may require such accounting
firm to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement with Parent prior to
commencing the audit. The accounting firm shall disclose to Rights Agent or
the Holders Representative, as applicable, only whether the reports are
correct or not and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No
other information shall be shared. Such audits may be conducted during normal
business hours upon reasonable prior written notice to Parent, but no more
than frequently than once per year. No accounting period of Parent shall be
subject to audit more than one time by the Rights Agent or the Holders
Representative, as applicable, unless after an accounting period has been
audited by the Rights Agent or the Holders Representative, as
applicable, Parent restates its financial results for such accounting period,
in which event the Rights Agent or the Holders Representative, as applicable,
may conduct a second audit of such accounting period in accordance with this
Section 4.5. Adjustments (including remittances of underpayments or
overpayments disclosed by such audit) shall be made by the Parties to reflect
the results of such audit, which adjustments shall be paid promptly following
receipt of an invoice therefor. The Rights Agent or the Holders
Representative, as applicable, shall bear the full cost and expense of such
audit unless such audit discloses an underpayment by Parent of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the Payment Amount due under this Agreement, in which case
Parent shall bear the full cost and expense of such audit.

5\. _HOLDERS  REPRESENTATIVE_.

 

5.1 _Appointment of Holders  Representative_. To the extent valid and binding
under applicable law, the Holders Representative is hereby appointed,
authorized and empowered to be the exclusive representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact of each Holder, with full power of substitution, to make
all decisions and determinations and to act (or not act) and execute, deliver
and receive all agreements, documents, instruments and consents on behalf of
and as agent for each Holder at any time in connection with, and that may be
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the intent and implement the
provisions of this Agreement and to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation for purposes of
(i) negotiating and settling, on behalf of the Holders, any dispute that
arises under this Agreement after the Effective Time, (ii) confirming the
satisfaction of Parents obligations under this Agreement and (iii)
negotiating and settling matters with respect to the amounts to be paid to
the Holders pursuant to this Agreement.

5.2 _Authority_. To the extent valid and binding under applicable law, the
appointment of the Holders Representative by the Holders upon the Effective
Time is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked in whole or in part
(including, without limitation, upon the death or incapacity of any Holder).
Subject to the prior qualifications, such appointment shall be binding upon
the heirs, executors, administrators, estates, personal representatives,
officers, directors, security holders, successors and assigns of each Holder.
To the extent valid and binding under applicable law, all decisions of the
Holders Representative shall be final and binding on all Holders. Parent and
the Rights Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, without independent
investigation, any act, notice, instruction or communication from the
Holders Representative and any document executed by the Holders
Representative on behalf of any Holder and shall be fully protected in
connection with any action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance thereon, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct by
Parent or the Rights Agent (as such gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct is determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, as applicable). The Holders Representative shall not
be responsible for any loss suffered by, or liability of any kind to, the
Holders arising out of any act done or omitted by the Holders
Representative in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Holders Representatives duties hereunder, unless such act or omission
involves gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

 

5.3 _Successor Holders_ __ _Representative_. The Holders Representative may
be removed for any reason or no reason by written consent of the Acting
Holders. In the event that the Holders Representative dies, becomes unable to
perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns or is removed from
such position, the Acting Holders shall be authorized to and shall select
another representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Holders Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement. The newly-appointed Holders Representative shall
notify Parent, the Rights Agent and any other appropriate Person in writing
of his or her appointment, provide evidence that the Acting Holders approved
such appointment and provide appropriate contact information for purposes of
this Agreement. Parent and the Rights Agent shall be entitled to rely upon,
without independent investigation, the identity and validity of such newly-
appointed Holders Representative as set forth in such written notice. In the
event that within 30 days after the Holders Representative dies, becomes
unable to perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns or is
removed from such position, no successor Holders

 



\- 15 -

    

 Representative has been so selected, the Rights Agent shall notify the
Person holding the largest quantity of the outstanding CVRs (and who is not
Parent) that such Person is the successor Holders Representative, and such
Person shall be the successor Holders Representative hereunder. If such
Person notifies the Rights Agent in writing that such Person declines to
serve, the Rights Agent shall forthwith notify the Person holding the next-
largest quantity of the outstanding CVRs (and who is not Parent) that such
next-largest-quantity Person is the successor Holders Representative, and
such next-largest-quantity Person shall be the successor
Holders Representative hereunder. (And so on, to the extent as may be
necessary.) The Holders are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.3. If a successor Holders Representative is not appointed pursuant to the
preceding procedure within 60 days after the Holders Representative dies,
becomes unable to perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns or
is removed from such position, Rights Agent shall appoint a successor Holders
Representative.

 

5.4 _Termination of Duties and Obligations_. Except to provide the written
consent contemplated in Section 4.3(d) (or to withhold such consent, as the
case may be), the Holders Representatives duties and obligations under this
Agreement shall survive until no CVRs remain outstanding or until this

The Rights Agent, Parent or the Holders Representative may specify a

6.2 _Notice by Rights Agent or the Holders  Representative to Holders_. Where

sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing
and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such
event, at the Holders address as it appears in the CVR Register, not
later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, if any,
prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders
is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in
any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will affect the sufficiency of
such notice with respect to other Holders.

6.3 _Parent Successors and Assigns; Merger of Rights Agent_.

(a) Parent may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Holders Representative, provided that (i) Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of
Parent (each, an " _Assignee_ ") provided that the Assignee agrees to assume
and be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) Parent may assign
this Agreement in its entirety without the consent of any other Party to its
successor in interest in connection with the sale of all or substantially all
of its assets or of its stock, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or
similar transaction (such successor in interest, the " _Acquiror_ ", and such
transaction, the " _Acquisition_ "). This Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Parents successors, acquirers
and each Assignee. Each reference to " _Parent_ " in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include Parents successors, acquirers and all Assignees. Each
of Parents successors, acquirers and assigns shall expressly assume by an
instrument supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Rights Agent,
the due and punctual payment of the CVR Payments and the due and punctual
performance and observance of all of the covenants and obligations of this
Agreement to be performed or observed by Parent.

 

(b) The Holders Representative may not delegate nor assign this Agreement nor
any right or obligation hereunder, in whole or part, without the prior
express written consent of the other Parties. Any permitted assignee shall
assume all obligations of the Holders Representative under this Agreement.

 

(c) The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Parent, provided that the Rights Agent may assign this Agreement
in its entirety without the consent of any other Parties to its successor in
interest in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets
or of its stock, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or similar

 transaction. Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights
Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any
successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the stock
transfer or other shareholder services business of the Rights Agent or any
successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this
Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the Parties hereto, provided that such Person would be
eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of
the Agreement. The purchase of all or substantially all of the Rights Agents
assets employed in the performance of transfer agent activities shall be
deemed a merger or consolidation for purposes of this Section 6.3(c).

 

6.4 _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
will give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Parent, Parents
successors and assignees, and the Holders) any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or
provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the Rights Agent, Parent, Parents successors and assignees,
and the Holders. The rights of Holders are limited to those expressly provided
in this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 

6.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.
The Parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision
of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable provision; provided, however, that if such excluded
provision shall affect the rights, immunities, liabilities, duties or
obligations of the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent shall be entitled to resign
immediately upon written notice to Parent.

 

6.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by electronic scan delivered by electronic
mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties hereto and delivered to
the other Party, it being understood that the Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

6.7 _Termination_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with the termination
rights set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will expire and be of no
force or effect, the Parties hereto will have no liability hereunder (other
than with respect to monies due and owing by Parent to Rights Agent or any
other rights of the Rights Agent which expressly survive the termination of
this Agreement), and no additional payments will be required to be made, upon
the expiration or termination of the CVR Term; provided that the following
provisions shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement and
shall remain fully effective and enforceable thereafter: Section 4.3(c)
(clause (iii) only), Section 4.3(d) (until the Outside Date), Section 4.5 (for
the one (1) year period specified therein) and Section 5.2.

(b) This Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Merger
Agreement prior to the Effective Time.

6.8 _Entire Agreement_. Notwithstanding the reference to any other agreement
hereunder, this Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions and matters contemplated
hereby and thereby and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among
the Parties with respect hereto and thereto. If and to the extent that any
provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.

 

6.9 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws. In any action or proceeding between the Parties arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, each Party: (a) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware or, to the extent that neither of the
foregoing courts has jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware; (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined exclusively in accordance with clause (a) of
this Section 6.9; (c) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action
or proceeding in such courts; (d) waives any objection that such courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party; (e) agrees
that service of process upon such Party in any such action or proceeding shall
be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 6.1 of this
Agreement; and (f) irrevocably and unconditionally waives the right to trial
by jury.

6.10 _Amendments_. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly
authorized signatories of Parent, the Rights Agent, and the Holders
Representative; provided, however, that Parent and the Rights Agent may,
without the consent of Holders Representative, amend this Agreement (a) as
may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the CVRs are not subject to
registration under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws, (b) to evidence the succession of
another Person to Parent and the assumption by such successor of the covenants
of Parent herein, (c) to evidence the succession of another Person as a
successor Rights Agent and the assumption by such successor of the covenants
and obligations of the Rights Agent herein; (d) to cure any ambiguity, to
correct or supplement any provision herein that may be defective or
inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions
with respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement; provided
that, in each case, such provisions do not adversely affect the interests of
the Holders, or (e) any other amendments hereto for the purpose of adding,
eliminating or changing any provisions of this Agreement, unless such
addition, elimination or change is adverse to the interests of the Holders.
Promptly after the execution by Parent and the Rights Agent of any amendment
pursuant to subsections (a)-(e) of this Section 6.10, Parent will mail (or
cause the Rights Agent to mail) a notice thereof by first class mail to the
Holders Representative and to each Holder at its address as it appears on the
CVR Register, setting forth such amendment. The failure to deliver such
notice, or any defect in such notice, shall not impair or affect the validity
of such amendment to this Agreement. Upon the execution of any amendment under
this Section 6.10, this Agreement will be modified in accordance therewith,
such amendment will form a part of this Agreement for all purposes and each
party and every Holder will be bound thereby.
