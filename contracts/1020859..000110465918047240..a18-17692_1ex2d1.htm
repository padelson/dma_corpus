the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue its existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall

(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing) and (b) forty-five (45) days after the date of this
Agreement (or such earlier date as Parent may specify in writing to the
Company on not less than two Business Days notice), subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_, or at

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub

containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall

 



      
 

 



 

become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time as is agreed
between Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under
the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 5.10(c)_, at the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company (the " _Charter_ ") until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, except
that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "SUPERVALU INC.".

 



 

(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 5.10(c)_, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company (the "
_Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be
"SUPERVALU INC.".

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Company and shall hold office until his or her successor has
been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until his or her earlier

applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A)
Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares and (B) for the avoidance of doubt,
any Company Restricted Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with
_Section 2.3(b)_ (such shares of Company Common Stock, other than those
contemplated by the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the " _Eligible
Shares_ ")), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $32.50
in cash per share of Company Common Stock (such amount in cash per share of
Company Common Stock, without interest, the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

 



 

(ii) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(iii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, other than, in each case,
shares of Company Common Stock held on behalf of third parties, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 



 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who
has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and
has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal (the "
_Appraisal Provisions_ ") of their shares of Company Common Stock has demanded
appraisal under the Appraisal Provisions with respect to any issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder
(" _Dissenting Shares_ "), then to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are
applicable, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, but
shall be

 



      
 

 



 

converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand
for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal,
in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each Dissenting Share shall thereupon be
treated as though such share of Company Common Stock had been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(i)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
at Parents expense in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or securities
or a different class by reason of any stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement (the " _Paying
Agent Agreement_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the
Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such aggregate Merger Consideration, the "
_Payment Fund_ ").

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the
third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail or otherwise provide notice to each holder of record of Eligible
Shares that are (i) Certificates or (ii) Book-Entry Shares not held through
DTC, advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice
shall include (A) appropriate transmittal materials (including a letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent (which shall be deemed to have been effected upon
the delivery of a customary "agents message" with respect to such Book-Entry
Shares or such other reasonable evidence, if

 



      
 

 



 

any, of such surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement) and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in _Section
2.2(j)_) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. With
respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC and such other
necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to ensure that the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or
its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures and such
other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC and
such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, the Merger
Consideration to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Eligible Shares that (i) are Certificates, by physical
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_) together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, (ii) are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book-
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the
surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of
surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent
Agreement), in each of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this
_Section 2.2(d)_, pursuant to such materials and instructions as contemplated
by _Section 2.2(c)_, and (iii) are Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, in
accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures and such other procedures
as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, DTC and such other
necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which
the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(i)_). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock may be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or
other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares

 



       
 

 



 

represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_, without interest. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent solely in cash or in liquid
money market funds that invest solely in short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days; _provided_ that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_, and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction
of its claim for Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in
accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and

 



      
 

 



 

withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any
amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 2.2(g)_, Parent), the posting by such Person of a bond in
a customary form and amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 2.2(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding under any
Company Stock Plan and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an
option (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase a number of shares of the
common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions as were applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the "change of control"
termination protections that apply to an assumed or substituted award under
the related Company Option award agreement, equal to the product of (1) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio (as defined below), with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. The exercise price per share of such
Adjusted Option shall be equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per
Share subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional cents
rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents. The exercise price per
share of any such Adjusted Option and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock relating to any such Adjusted Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case
of Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock subject to
vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions (a " _Company Restricted Share
Award_ ") that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a cash-settled
award with an aggregate amount payable thereunder equal to the product of (1)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted
Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Merger
Consideration, which cash-

 



      
 

 



 

settled award shall become payable (without interest) subject to the same
terms and conditions that were otherwise applicable to the Company Restricted
Share Award to which it relates immediately prior to the Effective Time
pertaining to lapse of forfeiture conditions, including the "change of
control" termination protections that apply to an assumed or substituted award
under the related Company Restricted Share Award agreement (and shall be
subject to applicable withholding).

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding
under any Company Stock Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a cash-settled award with an aggregate
amount payable thereunder equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) the Merger Consideration, which cash-settled award
shall become payable (without interest) subject to the same terms and
conditions that were otherwise applicable to the Company RSU Award to which it
relates immediately prior to the Effective Time pertaining to lapse of
forfeiture conditions, including the "change of control" termination
protections that apply to an assumed or substituted award under the related
Company RSU Award agreement (and shall be subject to applicable withholding).

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each performance share unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding
under any Company Stock Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a cash-settled award with an aggregate
amount payable thereunder equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award (at the target level of
performance or such other level as is specified in the applicable "change of
control" provisions set forth in the applicable Company PSU Award Agreement as
in effect on the date hereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2)
the Merger Consideration, which cash-settled award shall become payable
(without interest) subject to the same terms and conditions that were
otherwise applicable to the Company PSU Award to which it relates immediately
prior to the Effective Time pertaining to lapse of forfeiture conditions,
including the "change of control" termination protections that apply to an
assumed or substituted award under the related Company PSU Award agreement
(and shall be subject to applicable withholding); for the avoidance of doubt
any service-based vesting requirement (including a requirement to remain
employed or in service through the completion of the applicable performance
period) shall be retained and apply to the holders right to receive the cash
payment related to the Company PSU Award.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, each deferred stock unit award in respect of shares
of Company Common Stock (a " _Company DSU Award_ ") that is outstanding under
any Company Stock Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a cash-settled award with an
aggregate amount payable thereunder equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company DSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Merger Consideration, which cash-
settled award shall become payable (without interest) subject to the same
terms and conditions that were otherwise applicable to the Company DSU Award
to which it relates immediately prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Effective Time pertaining to lapse of forfeiture conditions, if any
(and shall be subject to applicable withholding).

 



 

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board of
Directors or the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions that
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(g) For purposes hereof, the " _Equity Award Conversion Ratio_ " shall mean
the quotient of (i) the Merger Consideration divided by (ii) the Parent
Trading Price. The " _Parent Trading Price_ " shall mean the volume weighted
average of the closing sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock on the
NASDAQ, as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal
(or, if not reported therein, as reported in another authoritative source) for
the thirty (30) full consecutive trading days ending on and including the
third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its best efforts to provide
for the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.
Parent shall prepare and, at or prior to the Effective Time, file with the SEC
a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment
to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the awards described in
this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.6(d)_, if at any time
before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes
or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances
are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Company and their respective
officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments,
deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary
or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent
of this Agreement.

Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, registrations, declarations,

Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger.

 



 

(d) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
(assuming the Transaction Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions
hereof will not, (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without

Liens, in each case, upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for such losses, suspensions, limitations,

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; Consents and

understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Commitment

unreasonable; provided, that this clause (A) shall not apply to any Retail

the Companys Cub banner (other than a Specified Transaction) and (B) Parents
prior written consent shall not be required with respect to any Retail Change

deferred or otherwise) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of any material
gain or loss by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as a result of any
intercompany transaction within the meaning of Treas. Regs. § 1.1502-13). From

representatives reasonably informed with respect to the material steps in the
implementation and overall progress of (A) the Pre-Closing Reorganization and
(B) any Retail Change, and shall consider in good faith Parents

 



      
 

 



 

views thereon and cooperate to seek the implementation of such views as to
material terms of any Retail Change other than a Specified Transaction.

 



 

(d) During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the

take any action that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing, (ii) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a material portion of the assets of or
equity in, any Person or enter into any new line of business, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such an
acquisition or purchase or the entering into of such new line of business, as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the obtaining of, or adversely affect in any material
respect the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to procure, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (B)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order,
ruling, judgment or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) take any action that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the
ability of Parent to otherwise perform its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement or of Parent or any of its Affiliates to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time or give the Company, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Access_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company shall afford Parent and its Subsidiaries, and its and their employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and
other third-party representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours upon reasonable advance notice to the Company, throughout the period
from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and the Effective Time, to its and its Subsidiaries
personnel, properties, books and records and such other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2(a)_,
any document, correspondence or information or other access provided pursuant
to this _Section 5.2(a)_ may be redacted or otherwise limited to prevent
disclosure of information concerning the valuation of the Company or the
Merger or other confidential or competitively sensitive information;
_provided_ that the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to minimize
such restrictions and permit such access and the furnishing of such documents,
correspondence or information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by compliance with the procedures set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement. All access pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_
shall be (i) conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii)
coordinated through the General Counsel of the Company or a designee thereof.
Parent and its Representatives shall not otherwise initiate communications
with any

 



      
 

 



 

employees of the Company or its Affiliates regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2_,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
any access, or make available any document, correspondence or information, if
doing so would, in the Companys and its legal counsels reasonable judgment,
(i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) result in (A) a violation of any Law applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the
business, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) the breach of any
contractual confidentiality obligations in any Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets or
properties are bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such instances the
Company shall inform the Parent of the general nature of the information being
withheld and, upon the Parent request, reasonably cooperate with the Parent to
provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not
result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , including by reasonably cooperating to take such actions and
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to as promptly as
practicable permit such access and the furnishing of such documents,
correspondence or information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by compliance with the procedures set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, entry into a customary joint defense agreement and,
with respect to the contractual confidentiality obligations contemplated by
the foregoing _clause (ii)(B)_ , seeking a waiver with respect to or consent
under such contractual confidentiality obligations. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2_, prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and its Representatives shall not conduct any sampling of soil,
sediment, surface water, groundwater or building material at, on, under or
within any of the Company Owned Real Property or the Company Leased Real
Property or any store, facility or warehouse located thereon.

 



 

(c) The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to them or their
respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of May 16, 2018, between the Company and Parent, and the Clean Team
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2018 (together, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents to not, and shall direct each of its financial advisors, investment

solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries

solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, proposal, offer or Company
Takeover Proposal, to ascertain facts from the Person making such inquiry,
proposal, offer or Company Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of the
Company Board of Directors informing itself about such inquiry, proposal,
offer or Company Takeover Proposal and the Person that made it and to refer
such Person to this _Section 5.3_), or (C) approve, recommend or enter into,
or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, (D) provide any non-public information

agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents to, and shall
direct each of its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any discussions

Representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly (but in any event within 48 hours of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement) terminate any physical and
electronic data or other diligence access previously granted to each Person
that has executed a confidentiality agreement during the 12 months prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of making a
Company Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ or
_(b)_ , if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an inquiry, proposal,
offer or Company Takeover Proposal from any Person that did not result from a
Willful Breach of _Section 5.3(a)_, and if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such inquiry, proposal, offer or Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such Person and its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall
substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives
unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and
(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
such Person and its Representatives regarding such inquiry, proposal, offer or
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within

receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that contemplates a
Company Takeover Proposal, including the material terms and conditions
thereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis (but in no event shall the Company be required to do so more
often than once every 24 hours), as to the status of (including any material
developments) such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company will not enter into
any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company Board of

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if (1) such action is taken in response to an
Intervening Event and (2) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) the
Company has given Parent at least two Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor, and (y) upon the end of such notice period, the Company
Board of Directors shall have considered any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and

 



      
 

 



 

outside legal counsel, that a written Company Takeover Proposal made after the
date hereof that did not result from a Willful Breach of _Section 5.3(a)_
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors may,
subject to compliance with this _Section 5.3(f)_, (x) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ in order to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal, subject to paying the
Company Termination Fee, which shall be paid prior to or concurrently with
such termination in accordance with _Section 7.3_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to so making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_, (A) the Company
has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, including the material terms and conditions of
any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed
Company Acquisition Agreements, (B) at the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and any other
information offered by Parent in response to such notice contemplated by
_clause (A)_ of this proviso prior to the end of such notice period, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
by Parent were to be given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any
of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in _clause (A)_ above of this proviso and a
new notice period under _clause (A)_ of this proviso shall commence (provided
that the notice period thereunder shall be only two Business Days) during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.3(f)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
_clauses (A)_ through _(C)_ above of this proviso.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of a disclosure described in the foregoing clause
(i) that is not of a type described in the foregoing clause (ii), if any such
communication does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation in such disclosure
or communication or has the effect of withdrawing, qualifying or modifying the
Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, such disclosure or
communication shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(h) From the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective
Time, the Company shall not terminate, amend or otherwise modify or waive any
provision of any "standstill" or similar provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to a transaction comparable to the
Merger; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend or
otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any such
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement if the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in any event within twenty Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary
proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms
mailed to the Companys stockholders, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
furnish all information concerning Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives that is required in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall (i) provide Parent, its outside legal counsel and its
other Representatives with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
drafts of the Proxy Statement and other documents and communications related
to the Company Stockholders Meeting prior to filing, furnishing or delivering
such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and dissemination of
such documents to the Companys stockholders and (ii) in the Companys
reasonable discretion, after consultation with Parent, include in the Proxy
Statement and such other documents and communications related to the Company
Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, its outside
legal counsel and its other Representatives, and the Company agrees that all
information relating to Parent, its Affiliates, the Financing Sources and
their respective Representatives included in the Proxy Statement shall be in
form and content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably; _provided_ that
the Company shall not have such obligations with respect to any Proxy
Statement and other documents and communications relating to any Company
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, or Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
(whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with
true and complete copies or, if oral, summary descriptions, of all
correspondence between the Company and any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
provide Parent, its outside legal counsel and its other Representatives a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any planned discussions or meetings
with the SEC (or portions of any such discussions or meetings that relate to
the Proxy Statement); _provided_ , that the Company shall not have such
obligations with respect to any Proxy Statement and other documents and
communications relating to any Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplates a Company
Takeover Proposal or Company Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall,
subject to the requirements of _Section 5.4(b)_, respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Proxy Statement. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof) any

 



      
 

 



 

information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company shall take
all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Companys
Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") as
soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders (but in any event within sixty days after the date
the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the
Company may file and commence mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement (and
if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to
such day)). Subject to _Section 5.3_ or this _Section 5.4_, unless the
Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall
solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including by
soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger and this Agreement).

 



 

(e) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may
from time to time adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to
allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure document that the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be
filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) (the " _Original Date_ ") there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (iii) if the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the
Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained ( _provided_ that any
adjournment or postponement pursuant to this clause (iii) shall not exceed 10
Business Days in connection with any one postponement or adjournment or more
than an aggregate of 20 Business Days from the Original Date, unless the
Company shall have received the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event may the Company Stockholders Meeting be
adjourned or postponed under this clause (iii) beyond the third Business Day
prior to the Original End Date) or (iv) with the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the

 



       
 

 



 

Company shall continue in all respects to comply with its obligations under
_Section 5.3_ and this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(f) Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company may not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the later
of the first anniversary of the Closing Date and December 31, 2019, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to the
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by
Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "):
(i) an annual base salary or wage rate and target and maximum short-term
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in each case,
than those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) pension (including both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans) and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the pension and welfare benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent. With respect to the annual equity awards to be granted in
September of 2019 by Parent, Parent shall cause Continuing Employees who
remain employed by the Surviving Company or an Affiliate at the time Parent
makes its long-term incentive compensation grants at such time to be at target
long-term incentive compensation amounts no less than those that would be
received by similarly situated employees of Parent; _provided_ that the type
of equity grants (and whether such awards will be cash or equity based) shall
be at the sole discretion of Parent and the target grant date fair value of
such grant shall be increased pro-rata to reflect the period of time between
February 23, 2019 and July 31, 2019, which prorated amount only shall be
calculated and determined based on the target long-term incentive compensation
grant date fair value of the annual long-term incentive equity grants such
Continuing Employees had most recently received from the Company. Without
limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing
Employee whose employment terminates during the 12-month period following the
Closing Date with severance benefits equal to the greater of (A) the severance
benefits to which such Continuing Employee is entitled to immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the individual agreements or severance plans or
policies of the Company set forth in _Section 3.9(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and (B) the severance benefits for which such Continuing
Employee would be eligible under the severance plans or policies of Parent or
its Affiliates, in each case, determined (1) without taking into account any
reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee
and (2) after taking into account each Continuing Employees service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the
Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any employee benefit
plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or their
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Parent_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor thereto) prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits under
such Parent Plans; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of benefit accrual under any Parent Plan that is a defined
benefit retirement plan, or (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service. With respect
to any Parent Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits,
for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to
participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause any
preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) credit each Continuing Employee for any co-payments or
deductibles incurred by such Continuing Employee in such plan year for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such Parent Plan. Such credited expenses shall also
count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or
similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" of the Company or other event with similar import, within the meaning
of the Company Benefit Plans that contain such terms, will occur upon the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may pay to any
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who participates in an annual
bonus plan for the Companys fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, a
prorated bonus for the portion of such fiscal year that has elapsed through
the Closing Date, which such bonus shall be calculated based on target
performance.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or other service provider any right to continue in the employ
or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or,
subject to _Section 5.5(a)_ hereof, shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates,
which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. The terms of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan
or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored
by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or
(ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Without limiting _Section
8.13_, nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any current or
former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates, or any
beneficiaries, dependents or collective bargaining representatives thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.6_, prior to
the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger as promptly as practicable, including (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate
the Merger, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to
consummating the Merger, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to
cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, expiration
or termination of a waiting period, permit, Order or approval of, waiver or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing as promptly as practicable all information and documentary material
required under the HSR Act, including, if applicable, any voluntary requests
for information or Request for Additional Information and Documentation (a "
_Second Request_ ") issued by the U.S. Department of Justice or U.S. Federal
Trade Commission in connection with the Merger) required to be obtained or
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger and (v) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.6_, Parent
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, each
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the Merger and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
5.6_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party to this Agreement
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly (i) consult
with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any
necessary information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably
request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other
Parties (or their counsel) with copies of) all notices, submissions or filings
made by or on behalf of such Party or any of its Affiliates with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by or on behalf of such
Party or Affiliate to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) promptly inform the
other Parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other Parties
with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other
Parties orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger, and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in
connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such
Governmental Entity. No Party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates shall
participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it consults with the
other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company and
their respective Affiliates may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other

 



      
 

 



 

under this _Section 5.6(b)_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be provided or otherwise
made available subject to the procedures set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
5.6_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ may be redacted (i)
to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual confidentiality arrangements and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality or
business secrets concerns; _provided_ that the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate to minimize such restrictions and permit access to such
materials in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by
compliance with the procedures set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) In furtherance of the provisions of _Section 5.6(a)_, but subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 5.6_, the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
make or file, as promptly as practicable, with the appropriate Governmental
Entity all filings, forms, registrations and notifications required to be
filed to consummate the Merger under any applicable Antitrust Law, and
subsequent to such filings, the Company and Parent will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable, respond to inquiries
from Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental information that may
be requested by Governmental Entities, in connection with filings made with
such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to (if applicable) file their notification and
report forms under the HSR Act no later than ten Business Days after the date
of this Agreement and in connection therewith, request early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act. In the event that the Parties or their
Affiliates receive a Second Request, the Parties will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to
submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second
Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Company shall, and Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, without the other Partys prior written consent, (i) enter
into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit
to any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending, suspending,
lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or termination of the waiting
period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or (ii) enter into any
timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement,
that would bind or commit the Parties not to complete the Merger (or that
would otherwise prevent or prohibit the Parties from completing the Merger)
after the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the
Merger under the HSR Act.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, in order to permit the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section
6.1(c)_ so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in
any event before the then-applicable End Date, (i) propose, negotiate, commit
to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of and
restriction on the businesses, assets, properties, product lines, and equity
interests of, or changes to the conduct of business of, the Company, Parent
and their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its
Affiliates) and take such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a
similar effect, (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company and its Affiliates), and (iii) otherwise take or commit
to take any action that would limit Parents or its Affiliates freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company and its Affiliates) (the actions described in the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ collectively, " _Remedial Actions_
"); _provided_ that any such sales, divestitures, licenses, holdings,
dispositions, restrictions, changes or similar effects are conditioned upon
and become effective only from and after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , _that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required
to take any Remedial Action if such Remedial Action, taken together with all
other Remedial Actions, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the consummation of
the Merger. If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any action
contemplated by this _Section 5.6_; _provided_ that any such agreement or
action is conditioned upon and becomes effective only from and after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will the Company
(and the Company will not permit any of its Affiliates to) propose, negotiate,
effect or agree to any such actions without the prior written consent of
Parent. No actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall be considered
for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Third-Party Consents_. Separate and apart from the obligations
set forth in _Section 5.6_, the Company shall use its, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts, and Parent shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate as necessary with the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to give and obtain (as the case may be) as
promptly as practicable prior to the Closing all notices, acknowledgments,
waivers and consents required under any Company Material Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound other than the Existing Notes and
the Credit Agreements, which shall be governed by _Section 5.13_ (the "
_Third-Party Consents_ ") that are necessary or advisable to be obtained in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
connection therewith, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to (and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed)) and neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to (but Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may,
in its sole discretion) (a) make any payment of a consent fee, "profit
sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated
payments) or concede anything of monetary or economic value, (b) amend,
supplement or otherwise modify any such Contract or (c) agree or

 



      
 

 



 

commit to do any of the foregoing, in each case, for the purposes of obtaining
any Third-Party Consents without the prior consent of Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Companys obligation to comply with
this _Section 5.7_ be construed to make the receipt of any Third-Party
Consent in and of itself a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs
obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes and Similar Matters_. No Party shall take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover
Statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws (including Section 203
of the DGCL) and regulations (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any
action that would result in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 5% or more of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors as of any record date of any Company Stockholder
Meeting.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the Parties and that the
Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement to the
extent required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange; in the case of press releases or public announcements by the Company
with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal or from and
after a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall not be
required to consult with Parent but shall give Parent a copy of any such press
release or public announcement prior to the issuance thereof and (b) in the
case of press releases or other public announcements that are consistent with
other communications made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with
this _Section 5.9_, neither Party shall be required to consult with or obtain
the consent of the other Party prior to the issuance thereof.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the

 



      
 

 



 

current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in the Company Organizational Documents and the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or
comparable constituent or Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the
Company or in any agreement set forth on _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (an " _Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, except as otherwise required
by changes in Law after the date of this Agreement. For a period of not less
than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the
Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent provided by and otherwise in accordance with: (i) the Company
Organizational Documents or the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or comparable
constituent or Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the Company as
in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) any Indemnity Agreement between
any such Indemnified Party on the one hand and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on the other hand, as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
and (iii) applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company to, in each
case, to the fullest extent permitted by (A) the Organizational Documents of
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (B) any Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party on
the one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, and (C) applicable Law: (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (including, in each case, any interest or assessments thereon) in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnified Party incurred or
expected to be incurred in connection with any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, in each case, to the extent that such Persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or
comparable constituent or Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the
Company, any Indemnity Agreement or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be obligated to pay for only
one law firm to represent the Indemnified Parties (and local counsel in each
necessary jurisdiction) with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For a period of six years after the Closing and at all times subject to
applicable Law, Parent shall cause the exculpation and indemnification
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to be no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties or the beneficiaries thereof than the provisions which are
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries. For a period of six
years after the Closing and at all times subject to applicable Law, Parent
shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving Company or any its
Subsidiaries or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) amend or
modify in any way adverse to the Indemnified Parties, or to the beneficiaries
thereof, the exculpation and indemnification provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to make
them less favorable to the Indemnified Parties or the beneficiaries thereof
than the provisions which are currently provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving
Company to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Companys
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the policy of the Company in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Company
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith
determination, provides the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may purchase a "tail" directors and officers insurance
and indemnification policy; _provided_ , that the Company shall not pay an
amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof by the Company for such "tail" policy. Any such "tail" directors and
officers insurance policy will satisfy Parents obligations under this
_Section 5.10(c)_ to provide DandO Insurance.

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs and representatives.

 



 

(e) This _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and permitted
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that such other Person or the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from

 



      
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper, in each case, regardless
of any actions taken or committed to be taken by Parent or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to _Section 5.6_, to obtain funds sufficient to fund the Merger
Consideration and the other Merger Amounts on or prior to the Closing Date. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing
Date on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including
using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect and, in the event
Parent is required to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2_,
enforce the Commitment Letter and any Definitive Financing Arrangements and
comply with its obligations thereunder; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis and in
a manner that will not impede the ability of the Parties to consummate the
Merger promptly at the Closing all conditions to the funding of the Financing
(including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the Commitment Letter and
the Definitive Financing Agreements; and (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive Financing agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions) (the "
_Definitive Financing Agreements_ "). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter and any other financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice upon obtaining knowledge of any fact, change, event or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.12(c)_, prior to the Closing, none of Parent or
Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreements without the Companys
prior written consent to the extent such termination, amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification or waiver would (i) add new conditions (or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent any existing condition) to the consummation of the
Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof,
(ii) reduce the amount of the Financing such that the aggregate funds that
would be available on the Closing Date, together with other immediately
available financial resources of Parent, would not be sufficient to pay the
Merger Amounts, (iii) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Financing Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified or waived, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce their rights
against such parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof
or in the Definitive Financing Agreements or (iv) reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the
Commitment Letter may be amended or supplemented to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners or syndication agents that had not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Upon any such amendment,

 



      
 

 



 

replacement, supplement, modification or waiver, the terms "Commitment Letter"
and "Definitive Financing Agreement" shall mean the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived and references to "Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by such Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreement as so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver of the
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated debt
offerings or other incurrences of debt for all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the
Commitment Letter; _provided_ that (i) to the extent any such debt has a
scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable
prior to the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date,
the termination of this Agreement and the End Date (as it may be extended
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_), (ii) there shall be no condition to the use of
such proceeds to pay the Merger Amounts that is less favorable to Parent than
the analogous condition set forth in the Commitment Letter and (iii) such debt
financing shall not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, or any of the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn,
repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable,
from the same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing and
on terms, taken as a whole, not materially less favorable to Parent than the
terms, taken as a whole, of the unavailable Debt Financing and in an amount
sufficient to enable Parent consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and pay the Merger Amounts. In the event any alternative financing
is obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.12(d)_ (" _Alternative
Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the Financing shall also be
deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment
letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be
entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements
shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and definitive
financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, references to
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by such commitment
letters or definitive financing agreements, and all obligations of Parent
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall be applicable thereto to the same
extent as Parents obligations with respect to the Financing.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 5.12(f)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Financing (subject to
Parents compliance with _Section 5.12(b)_ and _Section 5.12(c)_) or any

the fulfillment (or the waiver by Parent, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law) at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in (i)
_Section 3.10_ ( _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_ ) shall have been
true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and
correct as of the Closing Date as though made at the Closing Date, (ii)
_Section 3.1(a)(i)_ ( _Organization_ ) and _Section 3.3(a)_ ( _Corporate

the date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct as of the Closing
Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date, except for any _de minimis_
inaccuracies, (iii) _Section 3.2(a)(i)_ and the last sentence of _Section
3.2(b)_ ( _Capital Stock and Indebtedness_ ) shall have been true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct as of the
Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date, except for any
inaccuracies that would result in no more than a _de minimis_ increase in the
sum of the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate
amount to be paid in respect of Company Equity Awards pursuant to _Section
2.3_ of this Agreement, (iv) _Section 3.3(d)(ii)_ ( _No Violation_ ),
_Section 3.22_ ( _Finders or Brokers_ ) and _Section 3.23_ ( _State Takeover

have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true
and correct at and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to any qualification by "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein),
except where such failures to be so true and correct would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that representations and warranties that are made as of a particular date or
period shall be true and correct (in the manner set forth in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(v)_ as applicable) only as
of such date or period.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have performed and complied in all material respects
with all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with
by it prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated the

certifying to the effect that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_
and _Section 6.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this
_Article VI_ (as applicable such Party) to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such Partys failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on January 25, 2019 (the " _Original End
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1(b)_ (solely to the extent such condition has not been satisfied
due to an order or injunction arising under Antitrust Laws) or _Section
6.1(c)_ have not been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted), then, at
any time not more than 10 days prior to the then-applicable End Date, the End
Date may be extended by up to one month by Parent or the Company upon written
notice to the other, provided that the End Date shall not be extended more
than three times (each, an " _Extended End Date_ " and the Original End Date
or, if actually extended in accordance with the terms hereof, the Extended End
Date, the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that the Extended End Date shall not
occur after April 26, 2019; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a Party if the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the End
Date resulted from the material breach by such Party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an order by a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have been issued permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
order shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be
available to a Party if such order resulted from the material breach by such
Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such
Party set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholders Meeting (as
it may be adjourned or postponed) at which a vote on the Company Stockholder
Approval was taken shall have concluded and the Company Stockholder Approval
shall not have been obtained;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if there is any inaccuracy in any of the representations
or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub made in _Article IV_, or Parent or
Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, or breach or
failure to perform, respectively, (i) if it occurred or was continuing to
occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_, respectively, and (ii) is either
not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the then-applicable End Date
and (B) the date that is 30 days following written notice from the Company to
Parent; _provided_ that the Company shall not be permitted to

 



      
 

 



 

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ at any time that
it is in material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements contained
in this Agreement;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if there is any inaccuracy in any of the representations or
warranties of the Company made in _Article III_, or the Company shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, or breach or failure to
perform, respectively, (i) if it occurred or was continuing to occur on the
Closing Date, would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_, respectively, and (ii) is either not curable or
is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30
days following written notice from the Company to Parent; _provided_ that
Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(f)_ at any time that it is in material breach of any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(g) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
Parent, if the Company Board of Directors has made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; and

 



 

(h) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
the Company, in accordance with _Section 5.3(f)_.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall terminate (except
that the Confidentiality Agreement, the indemnification and reimbursement
provisions of _Section 5.12(f)_, _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article
VIII_ shall survive any termination), and there shall be no other Liability on
the part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, to the other except as provided in the indemnification and
reimbursement provisions of _Section 5.12(f)_ and in _Section 7.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve (x) any Party from
any Liability for any failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, if required to pursuant to this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
receive the proceeds of any financing shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub
from any such liability or of their obligations to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger), or (y) any Party from
Liability for a Willful Breach of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or for fraud prior to such
termination, in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights
and remedies available at Law or in equity.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_ or (iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover
Proposal (substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty-five percent (25%)
threshold set forth in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal") (a "
_Qualifying Transaction_ ") shall have been publicly made and not withdrawn at
least four Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof), (B) thereafter, (x) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or (y) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7.1(f)_ as a result of any Willful Breach by the Company of
_Section 5.3_, and (C) at any time on or prior to the twelve-month
anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
completes a Qualifying Transaction or enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Qualifying Transaction and such Qualifying Transaction is
subsequently completed, then in any such event the Company shall pay Parent
the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds in the case of
_clause (i)_, in accordance with _Section 5.3(f)_, in the case of _clause
(ii)_, within two Business Days after such termination and in the case of
_clause (iii)_, upon the consummation of such Qualifying Transaction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section
7.3_, then the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent against the Company from and after such termination and payment of
the Company Termination Fee in full pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section 7.3_, the Company shall have no further Liability of any kind for
any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated
hereby other than as set forth in _Section 7.2_ and this _Section 7.3_. Each
of the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended
to be a penalty but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination
Fee is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Company
Termination Fee, then the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%
per annum.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII.**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for covenants and agreements
that contemplate performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including in _Section
5.12(f)_, and _Section 7.3_), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions

 



       
 

 



 

contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring or required to incur
such expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Company shall
share equally all filing fees required to be paid to the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement and all fees and expenses with respect to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall pay all filing fees with respect to the
notification and report forms under the HSR Act filed by Parent and the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any costs and expenses associated with
the Pre-Closing Reorganization (including fees of Tax advisors and any Taxes
(including transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes) imposed in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization) shall
be paid by the Company.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.2(d)_, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes imposed on
the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transfer of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger shall be borne by Parent or Merger Sub and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Company Common Stock.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the
other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" form, or by any
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The Parties rights in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, including monetary damages, each of the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in

 



      
 

 



 

addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all
such rights and remedies shall be cumulative, except, in each case, as may be
limited by _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_). In the event any Party seeks any
injunctive or specific performance remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_,
such Party shall not be required to prove damages or obtain, furnish, provide
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_ and each Party waives
any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the
other Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the Parties hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.5_, each
Party agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against or involving any Financing Party, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Financing Source, or any of their respective former, current or
future Representatives, general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, successors or assigns
(collectively, and together with the Financing Sources and the Financing
Parties, the " _Financing Related Parties_ ") relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
including any dispute arising under or relating to any agreement entered into
by the Financing Related Parties in connection with the Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or if such court does not have
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, such action or proceeding shall
be heard and determined exclusively in any New

 



      
 

 



 

York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York,
and (ii) any such action or proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Financing Related Parties will have any liability to
the Company or any of its controlled Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its controlled
Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Related
Parties hereunder or thereunder relating to or arising of this Agreement or
the Financing.

 



 

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR ANY COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF
SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED THERETO). EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
CERTIFIES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS _SECTION 8.6_.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed given (a) upon personal delivery to the Party
to be notified; (b) when received when sent by email or facsimile by the Party
to be notified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notice given by email or
facsimile shall not be effective unless either (i) a duplicate copy of such
email or fax notice is promptly given by one of the other methods described in
this _Section 8.7_ or (ii) the receiving Party delivers a written
confirmation of receipt for such notice either by email or fax or any other
method described in this _Section 8.7_; or (c) when delivered by a courier

or to such other address as any Party shall specify by written notice so
given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
so telecommunicated or personally delivered. Any Party to this Agreement may
notify any other Party of any changes to the address or any of the other
details specified in this _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
five Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection
or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of changed
address of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of the
notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent may assign any of
their rights hereunder to a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior written consent of the Company, in which event all
references to Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) in this Agreement shall be
deemed references to such other Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, except that
all representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties made with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment by
Parent or Merger Sub shall adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Financing Agreements or reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the Holding Company Merger occurs, then this Agreement and all of the
rights, interests and obligations of SUPERVALU hereunder shall automatically
be deemed assigned and delegated to SUPERVALU Enterprises, in which event all
references to the Company in this Agreement shall be deemed references to
SUPERVALU Enterprises, except that all representations and warranties made in
this Agreement with respect to the Company as of the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to SUPERVALU
and all obligations in this Agreement of the Company shall be performed by
SUPERVALU or SUPERVALU Enterprises as appropriate to give effect to the
relevant provisions of this Agreement. Subject to the first sentence of this
_Section 8.8_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 8.8_ shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, a suitable and equitable provision to be
negotiated by the Parties, each acting reasonably and in good faith shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such legal, invalid or unenforceable
provision. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this
Agreement is not intended to grant standing to any Person other than the
Parties.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall
by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange require further approval of the stockholders of the
Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
approval of the

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders of the Company. To the extent any amendment or waiver to the
provisions of this Agreement of which the Financing Related Parties are
expressly made third party beneficiaries pursuant to _Section 8.13_
(including this _Section 8.11_) (and any provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision
would modify the substance of the foregoing provisions) is sought that would
be adverse to the rights of any Financing Source thereunder, the prior written
consent of such Financing Source shall be required before such amendment or
waiver is effective, and any such amendment or waiver without such prior
written consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
of such right or any other right hereunder, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise of any
other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that (a) its representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties,
