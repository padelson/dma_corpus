(d) All shares of TBT Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.05_ shall no longer be

beneficially owned by third parties, and (ii) shares of TBT Stock held in
respect of a debt previously contracted) shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration therefor (the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ").

 

(f) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub

(g) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of FFIN Stock
or TBT Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, FFIN shall appoint an exchange agent (the
" _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the exchange agent hereunder.

(b) At or promptly after the Effective Time, FFIN shall deposit with or

reasonably acceptable to the FFIN, FFIN shall, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to, mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time of certificates (other than with respect to Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) representing shares of TBT Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
," it being understood that any reference herein to a "Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of TBT Stock), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each
Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate and, if reasonably required
by FFIN or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of TBT Stock of a
bond in such amount as FFIN may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate; provided, that the amount of such bond may not exceed the
aggregate amount of such shareholders portion of the Merger Consideration))
to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such
other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for

 use in surrendering each Certificate in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of FFIN Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_. The
TBT shareholders will be entitled to receive their Merger Consideration only
after receipt by the Exchange Agent of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal. If a Letter of Transmittal contains an error, is incomplete or is
not accompanied by all appropriate Certificates, then the Exchange Agent will
notify that TBT shareholder promptly of the need for further information or
documentation.

(d) Within five (5) Business Days after surrender to the Exchange Agent of
its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal, or within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time for
any uncertificated shares of TBT Stock held of record in book-entry form
(subject to receipt of any customary tax documentation that may be reasonably
requested by the Exchange Agent), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such
holder of TBT Stock the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of FFIN Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
in respect of the shares of TBT Stock represented by such holders Certificate
or Certificates, and each Certificate surrendered will be canceled. FFIN may,
at its option, deliver any shares of FFIN Stock in book-entry form. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share of FFIN Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 1.06_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Certificate or
Certificates shall be deemed surrendered to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to FFIN Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of FFIN Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_.
However, upon surrender of such Certificate, the Merger Consideration,
together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share represented
by such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date at or after the Effective Time that
are payable with respect to the whole shares of FFIN Stock issuable with
respect to such Certificate and not paid, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of FFIN Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate with a record
date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a
payment date subsequent to the issuance of the FFIN Stock issuable with
respect to such Certificate.

(f) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
TBT Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the stock
transfer records of TBT, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of FFIN Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
formerly representing such TBT Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of FFIN and the Exchange Agent
that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(g) FFIN and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, if necessary, from any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as FFIN or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by FFIN or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by FFIN or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

 

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of TBT at the expiration of six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to FFIN. In such event, any former shareholders of TBT who
have not theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_ shall thereafter
look only to FFIN with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
FFIN Stock deliverable in respect of each share represented by a Certificate
such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon.

(i) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of FFIN,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of
TBT Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

Section 1.07 _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is
intended that the Integrated Mergers together be treated as a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement and the merger
agreement for the Second Step Merger, shall constitute, and are hereby
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). From and after the date of this Agreement and
until the Closing Date, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Integrated Mergers to so qualify, and will not knowingly
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action not to be taken, which action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Mergers from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 1.08 _Modification of Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, FFIN may elect, subject to the filing of all
necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals,
to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby so long as (i)
there are no material adverse federal or state income tax consequences to the
holders of TBT Stock as a result of such modification (taken as a whole and
not with respect to any individual holder), (ii) the after tax consideration
to be paid to the holders of TBT Stock is not changed in kind or reduced in
amount, and (iii) such modification will not be likely to materially delay or
jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals or the Closing.

 

Section 1.09 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each share of TBT Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by shareholders ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") who have not voted such shares in favor of this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and who will
have otherwise complied with the terms and provisions of Chapter 10,
Subchapter H of the TBOC will be entitled to those rights and remedies set
forth in Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC; but if a shareholder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the
TBOC, each such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions
of this _Article I_.

 



5

    

Section 1.10 _Second Step Merger_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, in accordance with the TBOC, FFIN shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into FFIN in the Second Step
Merger, with FFIN surviving the Second Step Merger and continuing its
existence under the Laws of the State of Texas, and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation ceasing as of the Second Effective
Time. In furtherance of the foregoing, FFIN shall cause to be filed with the
Texas Secretary of State, in accordance with the TBOC, a certificate of
merger relating to the Second Step Merger (the " _Second Certificate of
Merger_ "). The Second Step Merger shall become effective as of the date and
time specified in the Second Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the "
_Second Effective Time_ "). At and after the Second Effective Time, the Second
Step Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the TBOC.

 

Section 1.11 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Second Step Merger,
or at such later time as FFIN may determine in its sole discretion, FFIN will
cause the Bank Merger on the terms and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Bank Merger Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _"_ _A_ _"_
(the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). FFB shall be the surviving entity in the
Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence
of the Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger will become
effective immediately after the Second Effective Time or at such later time
as FFIN may determine. Prior to or on the date of this Agreement, the board of
directors each of FFB and the Bank have approved the Bank Merger Agreement and
FFB and the Bank entered into the Bank Merger Agreement. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the parties shall execute and cause to be filed applicable
articles or certificates of merger and such other documents as are necessary
to effectuate the Bank Merger.

24

    

(c) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(c)__ , no TBT
Employee Plan is, and neither TBT nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever

to ERISA Title IV.

(d) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(d)__ , there have
been no prohibited transactions (as defined in Code §4975(c)(1)), breaches of
fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any Law applicable to
the TBT Employee Plans that would directly or indirectly subject TBT, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any TBT Employee Plan to any taxes, penalties, or other
liabilities (including any liability arising from any indemnification
agreement or policy), except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
a material liability. Each TBT Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Code §401(a) has a current favorable determination or opinion letter and
each TBT-Sponsored Plan and, to the Knowledge of TBT, each PEO-Sponsored Plan,
has been amended for all existing amendments up to and including all changes
required by the most recent Required Amendments List applicable to the TBT
Employee Plan and has no obligation to adopt any amendments for which the
remedial amendment period under Code §401(b) has expired and TBT is not aware
of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination or opinion letter. Each TBT-Sponsored Plan and, to the Knowledge
of TBT, each PEO-Sponsored Plan, is so qualified and has been operated in
material compliance with applicable Law and its terms, any related trust is
exempt from federal income tax under Code §501(a) and no event has occurred
that will or reasonably could result in the loss of such tax exemption or to

(e) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(e)__ , neither TBT
nor any of its Subsidiaries provides post-termination benefits to any current
or former employee or service provider of TBT or any of its Subsidiaries, or
the dependent or spouse of any such current or former employee or service
provider, other than as required by applicable Law. No written or oral
representations have been made by or on behalf of TBT or any of its
Subsidiaries to any employee or former employee of TBT or any of its
Subsidiaries promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the
continuation of medical, dental, life or disability coverage or any other
welfare benefit (as defined in ERISA §3(1)) for any period of time beyond the
end of the current plan year (except to the extent of coverage required under
Code §4980B). The completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not cause a termination or partial termination, or otherwise
accelerate the time of payment, exercise, or vesting, or increase the amount
of compensation due to any current or former employee, officer or director of
TBT or any of its Subsidiaries except (i) as required by the terms of any TBT
Employee Plan or by applicable Law in connection with a qualified plan, (ii)
as contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) except as identified on
__Confidential Schedule 3.28(e)__. To the Knowledge of TBT, there are no
surrender charges, penalties, or other costs or fees that would be imposed by
any Person against TBT or any of its Subsidiaries, a TBT Employee Plan, or
any other Person, including a TBT Employee Plan participant or beneficiary,
with respect to any insurance, annuity, or investment contracts or any other
similar investment held by any TBT Employee Plan as a result of
the hypothetical liquidation as of the Closing Date.

(f) The execution, delivery and performance by TBT of its obligations
under the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or the approval of
TBTs shareholders of the Merger (whether alone or in connection with any
subsequent event(s)), will not result in any payments or benefits which would
not be deductible pursuant to Code §280G.

 



25

    

(g) All contributions to any TBT Employee Plan (including,
without limitation, all employer contributions, employee salary reduction
contributions and all premiums or other payments (other than claims)) that are
due and payable by TBT or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing
Date have been made with respect to each TBT Employee Plan and, to the extent
not presently payable, appropriate reserves have been established for the
payment and properly accrued in accordance with GAAP.

 

(h) Neither TBT nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowingly misled any person
as to his or her rights under any TBT Employee Plan. All obligations required
to be performed by TBT or any of its Subsidiaries under any TBT Employee Plan
have been performed in all material respects and neither TBT nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or in violation of any material provision of
any TBT Employee Plan. No event has occurred with respect to any TBT-Sponsored
Plan or, to the Knowledge of TBT, any PEO-Sponsored Plan, that
would constitute grounds for an enforcement action by any party against TBT,
any of its Subsidiaries or any fiduciary of any TBT Employee Plan that could
result in a material liability under part 5 of Title I of ERISA under any TBT
Employee Plan.

 

(i) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or
within the last six years, by TBT or any corporation or trade or business, the

Code §5000(b)(1) and ERISA §733(a)) have been operated up to the Closing in a
manner so as to not subject TBT or any of its Subsidiaries to any material
liability under Code §4980B or §4980D;

 

(ii) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(i)__ , there is no
Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in
Code §413(c)) or "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA §3(37)) or a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in ERISA §3(40)), nor has
there been any such plan under which TBT or any of its Subsidiaries had any
liability in the last 6 years (or would have had liability if notice had been
given); and

 

(iii) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(i)__ , each
Controlled Group Plan that provides (or has provided within the past 6 years)
for major medical, dental, vision, life, disability or similar coverage is
covered by one or more third-party insurance policies and neither TBT nor any
of its Subsidiaries is liable for self-insuring any such claims.

Each such Controlled Group Plan is included in the listing of Employee Plans
on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(a)__.

(j) Except as set forth on __Confidential Schedule 3.28(j)__ , all TBT
Employee Plan documents, annual reports or returns, audited, compiled or
unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports,

Subsidiaries or provides the opportunity for the grant, purchase or

(l) Except as provided in __Confidential Schedule 3.28(l)__ , TBT or any of
its Subsidiaries may, at any time amend or terminate any TBT Employee Plan

participation in any TBT Employee Plan to which it contributes (but does not
sponsor or maintain), without obtaining the consent of any third party, other
than an insurance company in the case of any benefit underwritten by an
insurance company, and without incurring liability except for unpaid premiums
or contributions due for the pay period that includes the effective date of
such amendment, withdrawal or termination.

(m) Each TBT Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Code §409A(d)(1) (a " _Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") subject to Code §409A has (i) been maintained
and operated since January 1, 2005 (or, if later, from its inception) in good
faith compliance with Code §409A of the Code and all applicable IRS
regulations promulgated thereunder and, as to any such plan in existence prior
to January 1, 2005, has not been "materially modified" (within the meaning of
IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004, or has been amended in a
manner that conforms with the requirements of Code §409A, and (ii) since
January 1, 2011, been materially in documentary and operational compliance

additional tax under Code §409A(a)(1)(B) has been or is reasonably expected to
be incurred by a participant in any such TBT Employee Plan or other contract,
plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. Neither TBT nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of taxes

value of the underlying equity security as of the date such stock option or
right was granted, as determined by TBT in good faith and in compliance with
the relevant IRS guidance in effect on the date of grant (including, IRS
Notice 2005-1 and § 1.409A-1 (b)(5)(iv) of the Treasury regulations), (B) has
any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition of such
option or right, or (C) has been granted after December 31, 2004, with respect
to any class of stock of TBT or any of its Subsidiaries that is not "service
recipient stock" (within the meaning of applicable regulations under Code
§409A).

(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of FFIN or its accountants. FFIN (and
each of its Subsidiaries) has devised, established and maintained a system of
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)

assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with

expenditures of FFIN and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the FFIN Board, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of FFINs and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material
effect on FFINs financial statements. FFINs "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by FFIN in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to FFINs management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of FFIN required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. FFIN has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
FFINs auditors and the audit committee of the FFIN Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect FFINs ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in FFINs internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of
this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness"
shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board Auditing Standard 5, as amended and in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

federal, state and other material Tax Returns that they were required to file

prepared in compliance with all applicable Laws and all material Taxes due
and owing by FFIN and each of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly
paid.

(b) FFIN and each of its Subsidiaries have collected or withheld and duly
paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity all material Taxes required to
have been collected or withheld and so paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other
third party.

(c) There is no action, suit, proceeding, audit, assessment, dispute
or claim concerning any material Tax liability of FFIN or any of its
Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised by any Governmental Entity in
writing, or (ii) as to which FFIN or any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge
based upon personal contact with any agent of such authority. To the
Knowledge of FFIN, no taxing authority has threatened in writing to assess
additional Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed.

 

(d) Neither FFIN nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a
reportable or listed transaction as defined under Section 6011 and 6111 of
the Code and Treasury Regulation § 1.6011-4. Neither FFIN nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been required to disclose on its federal income Tax Returns
any position that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal
income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.

 



35

    

(e) Neither FFIN nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any fact
or circumstance that reasonably could be expected to prevent the Integrated
Mergers from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

benefits to, or for the welfare of, any current of former officer, director,
independent contractor, employee, or service provider of FFIN or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the dependents or spouses of any such Person, regardless of
whether funded (the " _FFIN Employee Plans_ "), have been maintained and
operated in material compliance with applicable Law and the terms of the
plans. There have been no prohibited transactions (as defined in Code
§4975(c)(1)), breaches of fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations
of any Law applicable to the FFIN Employee Plans that would directly or
indirectly subject FFIN, any of its Subsidiaries, or any FFIN Employee Plan to

be expected to result in a material liability. Except as set forth on
__Confidential Schedule 4.14__ _,_ either FFIN nor any corporation or trade or
business that is a member of a controlled group with FFIN for purposes of
Title IV of ERISA or Code §414 currently maintains, contributes to, or has an
obligation to contribute to, or during the six year period ending on the
Closing Date, has maintained, contributed to, or had an obligation to
contribute to, (i) an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined under ERISA
§ 3(2)) that is subject to Title IV or Code §412, (ii) a "multiple employer
plan" (as described in Code §413(c)), (iii) a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in ERISA §3(37)) or (iv) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as
defined in ERISA §3(40)). No written or oral representations have been made by
or on behalf of FFIN or any of its Subsidiaries to any employee or former
employee of FFIN or any of its Subsidiaries promising or guaranteeing any
employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life or
disability coverage or any other welfare benefit (as defined in ERISA §3(1))
for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the
extent of coverage required under Code §4980B).

 

Section 4.15 _Representations Not Misleading_. No representation or
warranty by FFIN contained in this Agreement, nor any written statement,
exhibit or schedule furnished to TBT by FFIN under and pursuant to this
Agreement, contains or will contain on the Closing Date any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements contained herein or therein, in light of the
circumstances under which it was or will be made, not misleading and such
representations and warranties would continue to be true and correct following
disclosure to any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over FFIN or their
properties of the facts and circumstances upon which they were based.

 

Section 4.16 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except as expressly
set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement, none of FFIN, its Subsidiaries
or any other Person is making or has made, and none of them shall have
liability in respect of, any written or oral representation or warranty,
express or implied, at Law, in equity or otherwise, with respect to FFIN or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, and whether express or implied, at Law,
in equity or otherwise, in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, or in respect of any other matter whatsoever.
FFIN acknowledges and agrees that neither TBT nor any other person has made
or is making any express or implied representation or warranty other than
those contained in _Article III_.

from time to time, to furnish to FFIN as soon as practicable, any additional
information that FFIN may reasonably request. Neither TBT nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of TBTs or any of its Subsidiaries customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any Law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the
other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either
partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by

writing if TBT or the Bank becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes
untrue, or shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any schedule or

judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending or, to the
Knowledge of TBT, threatened against TBT or any of its Subsidiaries that
questions or

pursuant hereto or thereto or seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.10 _Material Adverse Changes_. TBT will promptly notify FFIN in
writing if any change or development has occurred or, to the Knowledge of TBT,

in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Change on TBT or any of its Subsidiaries,

approval for the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (c) would cause the conditions in _Article VIII_ not to be
satisfied.

 

Section 5.11 _Consents and Approvals_. TBT will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable time all consents

(a) FFIN and its consultants, agents and representatives will have the
right, to the same extent that TBT has the right, if any, but not the
obligation or responsibility, to inspect any Property, including conducting
asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments and investigations,
and other environmental surveys and analyses including soil and
ground sampling (" _Environmental Inspections_ ") at any time on or prior to
the date that is forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement. FFIN
will notify TBT prior to any physical inspections of the Property, and TBT may
place reasonable restrictions on the time of such inspections. If, as a
result of any such Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("
_Secondary Investigation_ ") including, test borings, soil, water and other
sampling is deemed desirable by FFIN, FFIN will (i) notify TBT of any
Property for which it intends to conduct such a Secondary Investigation and
the reasons for such Secondary Investigation, and (ii) commence such Secondary
Investigation, on or prior to the date that is seventy-five (75) days after
the date of this Agreement. FFIN will give reasonable notice to TBT of such
Secondary Investigations, and TBT may place reasonable time and place
restrictions on such Secondary Investigations.

 

(b) FFIN will have the right to terminate this Agreement if (i) the factual
substance of any warranty or representation set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.19_ is not true and accurate in any material respect; (ii) the results of
such Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey are disapproved by FFIN because the Environmental Inspection,
Secondary Investigation or other environmental survey identifies material
violations or potential material violations of Environmental Laws; (iii) TBT
has refused to allow FFIN to conduct an Environmental Inspection or Secondary
Investigation in a manner that FFIN reasonably considers necessary; (iv) the
Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey identifies any past or present event, condition or circumstance that
would or potentially would require remedial or cleanup action by TBT; (v) the
Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey identifies the presence of any underground or above ground storage
tank in, on or under any Property that is not shown to be in compliance with
all Environmental Laws applicable to the tank either now or at a future time
certain, or that has had a release of petroleum or some other Hazardous
Material that has not been cleaned up to the satisfaction of the relevant
Governmental Entity or any other party with a legal right to compel cleanup;
or (vi) the Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other
environmental survey identifies the presence of any asbestos-containing
material in, on or under any Property, the removal of which would result in a
Material Adverse Change. On or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days
after the 

 



42

    

 date of this Agreement, FFIN will advise TBT in writing as to whether FFIN
intends to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.01_
because FFIN disapproves of the results of the Environmental Inspection,
Secondary Investigation or other environmental survey. TBT will have the
opportunity to correct any objected to violations or conditions to FFINs
reasonable satisfaction prior to the date that is one hundred five (105) days
after the date of this Agreement. If TBT fails to demonstrate its satisfactory
correction of the violations or conditions to FFIN, FFIN may terminate this
Agreement on or prior to the date that is one hundred five (105) days after
the date of this Agreement.

(c) TBT agrees to make available to FFIN and its consultants, agents and
representatives all documents and other material relating to environmental
conditions of any Property including the results of other Environmental
Inspections and surveys. TBT also agrees that all engineers and consultants
who prepared or furnished such reports may discuss such reports and
information with FFIN and will be entitled to certify the same in favor of
FFIN and its consultants, agents and representatives and make all other data
available to FFIN and its consultants, agents and representatives.

Section 5.13 _Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(a) TBT agrees to cooperate and assist FFIN in (i) preparing a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (the " _Registration Statement_ "), relating to the
shares of FFIN Stock to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration provided
for herein, and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii) filing the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (forming a part of
the Registration Statement) with the SEC, including furnishing to FFIN all
information concerning TBT and each of its Subsidiaries that FFIN
may reasonably request in connection with preparation of such Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by TBT or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the
shareholders of TBT and, as the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus may be amended or supplemented, at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact with respect to TBT necessary in order to make the
statements therein with respect to TBT, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading or necessary to correct any statement in
any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for
the Shareholders Meeting. All documents that TBT is responsible for filing
with any Regulatory Agency in connection with the Merger shall comply with
respect to TBT in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.

they approve this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
herein and shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) If TBT becomes aware prior to the Effective Time of any information
that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to

any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, TBT shall promptly inform FFIN thereof and take the necessary
steps to correct the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

its commercially reasonable efforts, including, but not limited to, notifying

and the Bank will be in accordance with the terms of such data
processing/technology contracts or other contracts.

Subsidiaries shall, if requested by FFIN, consistent with GAAP, immediately
prior to Closing, make such accounting entries as FFIN may reasonably request
in order to conform the accounting records of TBT and each of its
Subsidiaries to the accounting policies and practices of FFIN; _provided,
however_ , that no such adjustment shall (a) constitute or be deemed to be a

termination of this Agreement (except to the extent that a certain
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision is breached and thus,
requires the adjustment), (b) require any prior filing with any Governmental
Entity, (c) violate any Law, rule or regulation applicable to TBT or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (d) be an acknowledgment by TBT or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) of any adverse circumstances for purposes of determining

pursuant to this Agreement or that results in the failure of FFIN to comply
with any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.04 _Litigation and Claims_. FFIN shall promptly notify TBT of
any legal action, suit or proceeding or judicial, administrative or

Continued Employee shall be entitled, as an employee of FFIN or its
Subsidiaries, to participate in the employee benefit plans of FFIN as set
forth in __Confidential Schedule 6.07(a)__ hereto in effect as of the date of

selected for participation therein under the terms thereof and makes any
required contributions. All such participation shall be subject to such terms
of such plans as may be in effect from time to time and this _Section_ __ _
6.07_ is not intended to give any Continued Employee any rights or privileges
superior to those of other similarly situated employees of FFIN or its

subject to that qualification, FFIN shall, solely for purposes of vesting (but
not benefit accrual) and any age or period of service requirements for
commencement of participation with respect to any employee benefit plans in
which a Continued Employee may participate (excluding any defined benefit

Continued Employee during such year under TBTs group health plan.

 

(d) Each Continued Employee shall be permitted to rollover and receive
credit under FFINs policies regarding sick leave for accrued but unused paid
sick leave as of the Closing Date, up to a maximum amount permitted under such
FFIN policies.

 



49

    

(e) The survivor income arrangements identified on __Confidential Schedule
6.07(e)__ in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall survive
Closing and the Continued Employees who are parties thereto shall remain

modify a representation or warranty of this Agreement.

Section 6.10 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement (including _Sections 5.04_ , _5.05_ and _5.06_ )
shall give FFIN, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of TBT prior to the Effective Time or shall give TBT, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of FFIN. Prior to
the Effective Time, (a) each of TBT and FFIN shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations, (b) TBT shall not be
under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to

not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 6.11 _Nasdaq Listing_. FFIN shall file all documents required to
be filed to have the shares of FFIN Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement included for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and use its

Section 6.12 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a three (3) year period after the Effective Time, and subject to
the limitations contained in applicable Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC
regulations and to any limitations contained in the TBT Constituent Documents,
FFIN will indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses to) each
present director and officer of TBT or the Bank, determined as of the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or before the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after the Effective
Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or
she was acting in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the TBT or
the Bank to the fullest extent that the Indemnified Party would be entitled
under the TBT Constituent Documents, as applicable, in each case as in effect
on the date hereof and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, is to promptly notify FFIN, but the failure to so
notify will not relieve FFIN of any liability it may have to the Indemnified

 



50

    

 Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice FFIN. In any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) FFIN will have the right to assume the defense thereof
and FFIN will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by an Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if FFIN elects not
to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party is of the opinion
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between FFIN and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to FFIN, and FFIN will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one
firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) FFIN will not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, and (iv) FFIN will have no
obligation hereunder if indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations.

Section 6.13 _Tax Matters_. Following the Closing:

 

(a) FFIN shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or caused to be
filed, all Tax Returns for TBT that are to be filed after the Closing and
shall pay all Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns.

(b) FFIN and its counsel shall control any audit of TBTs federal or state

settlement.

(c) FFIN shall comply with the recordkeeping and information reporting
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3.

(d) FFIN will not take any action or omit to take any action that would
prevent or impede the Integrated Mergers taken together from qualifying as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code or satisfying the
"continuity of business enterprise" requirement for a "reorganization" as
provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). FFIN will comply, to the
extent reasonably expected to be necessary to cause the Integrated Mergers
taken together to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Code, with all representations, warranties, and covenants
contained in the FFIN Certificate.

 

Section 6.14 _Tax-free Reorganization_. Officers of FFIN and Merger Sub
shall execute and deliver to Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP and Fenimore Kay
Harrison and Ford, LLP, respectively, certificates (the " _FFIN Certificate_ ")
containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to each counsel, at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by each counsel, including the Closing Date (and, if
requested, as of the date on which the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC), in connection with each counsels delivery of an
opinion with respect to the Tax treatment of the Integrated Mergers pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.17,_ and FFIN shall

employees, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and authorized
representatives of TBT full access (excluding any information that is
prohibited from being disclosed by applicable Law) during normal business
hours to the properties, books, contracts and records of FFIN and each of its
Subsidiaries as TBT may reasonably require and furnish to TBT during such 

 



51

    

 period all such information concerning FFIN, each of its Subsidiaries and
its affairs as TBT may reasonably request, in order that TBT may have full
opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it desires to make of
the affairs of FFIN and each of its Subsidiaries, including access sufficient
to verify the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to TBTs obligations
described in Article VII of this Agreement. TBT will use its commercially
reasonable efforts not to disrupt the normal business operations of FFIN or
any of its Subsidiaries. FFIN agrees at any time, and from time to time, to
furnish to TBT as soon as practicable, any additional information that TBT
may reasonably request. Neither FFIN nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of FFINs or any of
its Subsidiaries customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any Law, rule,
regulation, Order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. No investigation by either
party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to either partys obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

writing of its intent to terminate stating the reason therefor. FFIN shall

have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege

partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder will preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver of any party of any right or remedy on any one occasion
will not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would
otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other

"), F. Scott Dueser (" _Proxy Holder_ "), as proxy, and the shareholders of

"). Terms with their initial letters capitalized and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings given them in the Merger Agreement (as defined

 _RECITALS_

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, FFIN, Brazos
Merger Sub, Inc. (" _Merger Sub_ "), a Texas corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of FFIN, and TBT, have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
providing for, among other things, FFINs acquisition of TBT through the
merger of Merger Sub with and into TBT, with TBT surviving the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of FFIN (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of TBT (the " _Common
Stock_ "), other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, will be
exchanged for such consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to FFINs willingness to enter into the
Merger Agreement, each of the Shareholders have agreed to vote their shares
of Common Stock in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby; and

WHEREAS, FFIN is relying on the agreements set forth herein in incurring
expenses in reviewing the business of TBT and The Bank and Trust of
Bryan/College Station, a Texas banking association with its principal offices
in Bryan, Texas and a wholly owned subsidiary of TBT (the " _Bank_ "), in
proceeding with the filing of applications for regulatory approvals, and in
undertaking other actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger, and
the Shareholders are benefiting both from such expenditures by FFIN and by
the terms of the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, TBT, FFIN, the Proxy Holder and the Shareholders undertake,
promise, covenant and agree with each other as follows:

 

 _AGREEMENT_

 

1. Each Shareholder, being the registered owner or beneficial owner of the number of shares of Common Stock set forth below the Shareholders name on the signature pages hereto (for each such Shareholder, the " _Shares_ "), will vote, direct to vote, or act by consent with respect to: 

 



     | (a) |

the Shares; 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

all Common Stock the Shareholder owns as of the record date of any meeting of
the shareholders of TBT or otherwise as of the date of such vote or consent;
and 

---|---|--- 
        | (c) |

all Common Stock the Shareholder owns beneficially and has the power and
authority to direct the voting thereof as of the record date of any meeting
of the shareholders of TBT or otherwise as of the date of such vote or consent 

---|---|--- 
 

(clauses (a), (b) and (c), collectively, the " _Proxy Shares_ "), in favor of
approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

2. If TBT conducts a meeting of or otherwise seeks approval of its shareholders with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any other matter that may contradict this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or may prevent FFIN or TBT from completing the Merger, then the Shareholders will vote the Proxy Shares against the approval of the Acquisition Proposal or otherwise act in the manner most favorable to completing the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

 

3. Each Shareholder shall not invite or seek any Acquisition Proposal, support (or publicly suggest that anyone else should support) any Acquisition Proposal that may be made, or ask the TBT Board to consider, support or seek any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take any action designed to make any Acquisition Proposal more likely. None of the Shareholders shall meet or otherwise communicate with any Person that makes or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any representative of such Person after becoming aware that the Person has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal. Each Shareholder shall promptly advise TBT of each contact the Shareholder or any of the Shareholders representatives may receive from any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise indicating that any Person may wish to participate or engage in any transaction arising out of any Acquisition Proposal and will provide TBT with all information FFIN requests that is available to the Shareholder regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or possible Acquisition Proposal. Each Shareholder will not make any claim or join in any litigation alleging that the TBT Board is required to consider, endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal or to invite or seek any Acquisition Proposal. Each Shareholder shall not take any other action that is reasonably likely to make consummation of the Merger less likely or to impair FFINs ability to exercise any of the rights granted by the Merger Agreement. 

 

4. Each Shareholder, severally, but not jointly, represents and warrants to FFIN that: 

 



     | (a) |

Shareholder (i) owns beneficially (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) all of the Shares free and clear of all liens or
encumbrances, (ii) except pursuant hereto, there are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which Shareholder is a party relating to the pledge, disposition or voting of
any of the Shares and there are no voting trusts or voting agreements with
respect to the Shares, and (iii) has the sole voting power over all of the
Shares. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Shareholder does not beneficially own any Common Stock other than (i) the
Shares and (ii) any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any
additional shares of Common Stock or any security exercisable for or
convertible into shares of Common Stock, set forth on the signature page of
this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



B-3

         | (c) |

Shareholder has full power and authority and legal capacity to enter into,
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform fully Shareholders
obligations hereunder (including the proxy described in _Section_ __ _ 5_
below). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Shareholder and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder, the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or
compliance by Shareholder with any of the provisions hereof will conflict with
or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under any provision of, any trust agreement, loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument or law applicable to Shareholder or to Shareholders property or
assets. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity or other Person on the part of
Shareholder is required in connection with the valid execution and delivery of
this Agreement. No consent of Shareholders spouse is necessary under any
"community property" or other laws in order for Shareholder to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Shareholder hereby (a) confirms his or her knowledge of the availability of
the rights of dissenting shareholders under the Texas Business Organizations
Code (the " _TBOC_ ") with respect to the Merger and (b) confirms receipt of a
copy of the provisions of the TBOC related to the rights of dissenting
shareholders. Each Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and
shall use its best efforts to cause any of its Affiliates who hold of record
any of the Shareholders Shares to waive and not to assert, any appraisal
rights with respect to the Merger that the Shareholder or such Affiliate may
now or hereafter have with respect to any Shares (or any other shares of
capital stock of TBT that the Shareholder shall hold of record at the time
that the Shareholder may be entitled to assert appraisal rights with respect
to the Merger) whether pursuant to the TBOC or otherwise. 

---|---|--- 
 

5. In order to better effect the provisions of _Sections 1_ and _2_ of this Agreement, each Shareholder hereby revokes any previously executed proxies and hereby constitutes and appoints Proxy Holder, with full power of substitution, his true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact to vote at any meeting of the shareholders of TBT all of the Proxy Shares in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties thereto may make; _provided, however_ , that this proxy will not apply with respect to any vote on approval of the Merger Agreement if the Merger Agreement is modified so as to (a) reduce the amount of consideration or the form of consideration to be received by the Shareholder or (b) materially alter the tax consequences of the receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its present form. This proxy shall be limited strictly and solely to the power and authority to vote the Proxy Shares in the manner and for the purpose set forth in _Sections 1_ and _2_ of this Agreement and shall not extend to any other matters. 

 



B-4

    

6. Each Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, each Shareholder will not, and will not agree to, without the consent of FFIN, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, hypothecate, cause to be redeemed or otherwise dispose of (any such transaction, a " _Transfer_ ") any of the Shares or grant any proxy or interest in or with respect to any Shares or deposit any such Shares into a voting trust or enter into another voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such Shares except as contemplated by this Agreement. Any attempted Transfer of Shares or any interest therein in violation of this Section shall be null and void. This Section shall not prohibit a Transfer of the Shares to any member of Shareholders immediate family, to another Shareholder, to a trust for the benefit of Shareholder or any member of Shareholders immediate family, or upon the death of Shareholder; provided, that a Transfer referred to in this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in a writing, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to FFIN and TBT, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement. 

 

7. Proxy Holder, by his execution below, agrees to (a) vote all of the Shareholders Proxy Shares at any meeting of the shareholders of TBT, in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties thereto may make; _provided, however_ , that this proxy will not apply with respect to any vote on approval of the Merger Agreement if the Merger Agreement is modified so as to (i) reduce the amount of consideration or the form of consideration to be received by the Shareholder or (ii) materially alter the tax consequences of the receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its present form, and (b) in the event of an Acquisition Proposal, to vote all of the Shareholders Proxy Shares at any meeting of the shareholders of TBT, against the approval of the Acquisition Proposal or otherwise act in the manner most favorable to completing the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

 

8. Each Shareholder acknowledges that FFIN and TBT are relying on this Agreement in incurring expenses in connection with FFINs review of TBT and the Banks business, in FFINs preparation, with TBTs cooperation, of a proxy statement and Registration Statement on Form S-4, in FFINs proceeding with the filing of applications for regulatory approvals, and in their undertaking other actions necessary for completing the Merger and that THE PROXY GRANTED HEREBY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND IS IRREVOCABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, SECTION 21.369 OF THE TBOC. The Shareholders and TBT acknowledge that the performance of this Agreement is intended to benefit FFIN. 

 

9.

EXHIBIT C

 

 _FORM OF DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT_

 

This DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of September 19, 2019, by and between First Financial Bankshares, Inc., a
Texas corporation and registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHCA_ "), with its principal offices
in Abilene, Texas (" _FFIN_ "), and [ ], an individual
resident of the State of Texas (" _Director_ "). Terms with their initial
letters capitalized and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given
to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

 _RECITALS_

WHEREAS, FFIN, Brazos Merger Sub, Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of FFIN (" _Merger Sub_ "), and TBandT Bancshares, Inc., a Texas
corporation and registered bank holding company under the BHCA (" _TBT_
"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing for FFINs acquisition
of TBT through the merger of Merger Sub with and into TBT, with TBT surviving
as a wholly owned subsidiary of FFIN (the " _Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to FFINs willingness to enter into
the Merger Agreement, FFIN and Director have agreed to enter into this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and in the Merger Agreement intending to be legally bound
hereby, FFIN and Director agree as follows;

 

 _AGREEMENT_

 

1. _Director Support_. Director agrees to use his or her good faith efforts to refrain from harming the goodwill of TBT, any Subsidiary of TBT (" _TBT Subsidiary_ "), FFIN or any Subsidiary of FFIN, and their respective customer, client and vendor relationships. During the term of this Agreement, Director agrees to consider utilizing First Financial Bank, National Association, a national association with its principal office in Abilene, Texas and wholly owned subsidiary of FFIN, when obtaining banking products or services for his or her personal or business needs. 

 

2. _Director Covenants_. 

 

(a) Director acknowledges that he or she has received substantial, valuable
consideration, including confidential trade secret and proprietary
information relating to the identity and special needs of current and
prospective customers of TBT or any TBT Subsidiary, TBTs and any TBT
Subsidiarys current and prospective services, TBTs and any TBT Subsidiarys
business projections and market studies, TBTs and any TBT Subsidiarys
business plans and strategies, TBTs and any TBT Subsidiarys studies, and
information concerning special services unique to TBT or any TBT Subsidiary.
Director further acknowledges and agrees that this consideration constitutes
fair and adequate consideration for the execution of the non-solicitation
and non-competition restrictions set forth below. Accordingly, other than in
any capacity for or on behalf of FFIN or any Subsidiary of FFIN, Director
agrees that Director will not, directly or indirectly, individually or as an
employee, partner, officer, director or shareholder or in any other capacity
whatsoever:

 

i. solicit the business of any person or entity who is a customer of TBT or
any TBT Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date
on behalf of any other insured depository institution for the purpose of
providing financial services to such person or entity;

   

ii. acquire any interest in (directly or indirectly), charter, operate or
enter into any franchise or other management agreement with any insured
depository institution that has a location within a 35 mile radius of any
location of TBT or any TBT Subsidiary (the " _Noncompete Area_ ")
(but notwithstanding the foregoing, Director may (1) acquire an ownership
interest in any publicly-traded depository institution, so long as that
ownership interest does not exceed 1% of the total number of shares
outstanding of that depository institution, and (2) invest in an existing
mutual fund that invests, directly or indirectly, in such insured depository
institutions);

 

iii. from and after the Effective Time, serve as an officer, director,
employee, agent or consultant to any insured depository institution that has
a location within the Noncompete Area;

iv. establish or operate a branch or other office of an insured depository
institution within the Noncompete Area; or

 

v. recruit, hire, assist others in recruiting or hiring, discuss employment
with, or refer others concerning employment, any person who is, or within the
12 months preceding the Closing Date was, an employee of TBT or any TBT
Subsidiary; but nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2(a)(v)_ applies to employment
other than in financial services.

Director may not avoid the purpose and intent of this _Section_ __ _ 2(a)_ by
engaging in conduct within the Noncompete Area from a remote location through
means such as telecommunications, written correspondence, computer generated
or assisted communications, or other similar methods.

 

(b) If any court of competent jurisdiction should determine that the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 2_ are too broad in terms of time, geographic area,
lines of commerce or otherwise, that court is to modify and revise any such
terms so that they comply with applicable law.

 

(c) Director agrees that (i) this Agreement is entered into in connection
with the sale to FFIN of TBT and The Bank and Trust of Bryan/College Station, a
Texas banking association with its principal place of business in Bryan, Texas
(the " _Bank_ "), (ii) Director is receiving valuable consideration for this
Agreement, (iii) the restrictions imposed upon Director by this Agreement are
essential and necessary to ensure FFIN acquires the goodwill of the TBT and
the Bank, and (iv) all the restrictions (including particularly the time and
geographical limitations) set forth in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable.

3. _Early Resolution Conference_. This Agreement is understood to be clear and enforceable as written and is executed by both parties on that basis. However, should Director later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable, or inapplicable to any competitive activity that Director intends to engage in, Director will first notify FFIN in writing and meet with a FFIN representative and a neutral mediator (if FFIN elects to retain one at its expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Director will provide this notice at least twenty-one (21) days before Director engages in any activity on behalf of a competing business or engages in other activity that could foreseeably fall 

 



C-3

    

 within a questioned restriction. If Director fails to comply with this
requirement, Director waives his right to challenge the reasonable scope,
clarity, applicability or enforceability of this Agreement and its
restrictions at a later time.

4. _Termination_. This Agreement and all obligations hereunder will terminate on the earlier of (a) the date the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Merger Agreement or (b) the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date. 

 

5. _Waiver, Amendment and Modification_. Any party may unilaterally waive a right which is solely applicable to it. Such action will be evidenced by a signed written notice. No failure to exercise nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder by any party hereto will operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver of any party of any right or remedy on any one occasion will not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other party may have hereunder. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by an instrument in writing executed by each of the parties hereto. 

6. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE PROVISIONS THEREOF REGARDING CHOICE OF LAW THAT WOULD APPLY THE LAW OF A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION. VENUE FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL LIE IN TAYLOR COUNTY, TEXAS. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 6_. 

 

7. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. All of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and are enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors, representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any purported assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section shall be null and void. 

 



C-4

    

8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Persons, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

 

9. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, then (a) this Agreement is to be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were not a part hereof; (b) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement; and (c) there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a provision mutually agreed to which is similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid and enforceable. 

 

10. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the other parties would be irreparably damaged and would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages if any of the covenants contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise were materially breached. Each of the parties hereto therefore agrees that, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond or other security, the other party will be entitled to temporary and/or permanent injunction or injunctions which a court of competent jurisdiction concludes is justified to prevent breaches of such performance and to specific enforcement of such covenants in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. 

 

11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the other agreements, documents, schedules and instruments signed and delivered by the parties to each other at the Closing are the full understanding of the parties, a complete allocation of risks between them and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements, whether written or oral, that may exist between the parties with respect thereto. 

 

12. _Rules of Construction_. Descriptive headings as to the contents of particular sections are for convenience only and do not control or affect the meaning, construction or interpretation of this Agreement or any particular section. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
