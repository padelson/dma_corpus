 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November
1, 2016 (the " _Effective Date_ "), is made by and among Kolltan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Celldex
Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Connemara Merger
Sub 1 Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), Connemara Merger Sub 2 LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub
II_ "), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company (the " _Stockholders Representative_ "), solely in its
capacity as the representative for the Stockholders. Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II and the Company, and, solely in its capacity as and solely to
the extent applicable, the Stockholders Representative, shall be referred to
herein from time to time as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_." Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in _Article XI_ below.

 



 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, and
the manager of Merger Sub II, have each approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers (as
defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company and Merger Sub, and the
manager of Merger Sub II, have each determined (i) that the Mergers are fair,
advisable and in the best interests of such corporation or limited liability
company, as applicable, and their respective equity holders and (ii) to
recommend to its respective equity holders the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers.

 



 

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain Stockholders shall also have executed and delivered support
agreements in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Support
Agreements_ ") requiring such Stockholders to vote in favor and approve the
Mergers.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGERS

 



 

1.01 _The Mergers._

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the First Effective Time,
(i) Merger Sub shall merge (the " _First Merger_ ") with and into the Company
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and (ii) as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub
II (the " _Second Merger_ ," and together with the First Merger, the "
_Mergers_ "), in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act ("
_DLLCA_ ") with Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ").

      
 

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit C-1_ hereto (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings
required by the DGCL in connection with the First Merger. The First Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _First Effective
Time_ ").

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Company and Merger Sub II shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit C-2_ hereto (the " _Second
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly following the filing of
the Certificate of Merger and make all other filings or recordings required by
the DLLCA in connection with the Second Merger. The Second Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Second Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Second Effective Time_
").

 



 

(d) From and after the First Effective Time, the Company shall succeed to all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all
of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 



 

(e) From and after the Second Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
succeed to all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub II, all as provided under the DLLCA.

 



 

(f) It is intended by the Parties hereto that, consistent with IRS Revenue
Ruling 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321, the Mergers shall constitute an integrated,
single-step "reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A)
to which each of the Company and Parent are to be parties under Code Section
368(b), and, unless otherwise required by Law, agree not to take any position
that is inconsistent with such characterization on any Tax Return, before any
Governmental Entity or otherwise. However, no Party makes any representations
or warranties to the other Parties or any holder of Company Stock or Company
Options that the transactions contemplated hereby will qualify as a tax-free
"reorganization" under the Code. Each Party acknowledges that it and the
holders of Company Stock and Company Options are each relying solely on their
own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement and the transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

 



 

1.02 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Lowenstein
Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10020, at
10:00 a.m. local time on the second (2nd) Business Day following the full
satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ hereof (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or on such other
date and/or time as is mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company. The date
upon which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

1.03 _Organizational Documents_.

 



 

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any
shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, (a) the Certificate of
Incorporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the First Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and the DGCL, subject to _Section 5.01_;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that at the First Effective Time, ARTICLE I of the
Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Kolltan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc." and (b) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof, the Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL.

 



 

(b) At the Second Effective Time, (i) the certificate of formation of Merger
Sub II shall continue unchanged and shall be the certificate of formation of
the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein and by the
DLLCA, and (ii) the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub II shall
continue unchanged and be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein and by the
DLLCA.

 



 

1.04 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the First Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub at the First Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Company, and the officers of Merger Sub at the
First Effective Time shall be the officers of the Company, each such initial
directors and initial officers to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect from and
after the First Effective Time. At the Second Effective Time, (i) the manager
of Merger Sub II immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall continue
to be the manager of the Surviving Company immediately after the Second
Effective Time until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, and
(ii) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time shall continue to be the officers of the Surviving Company immediately
after the Second Effective Time until their respective successors are duly
appointed. Following the Closing, subject to compliance with the Parents
normal board member nominating procedures and applicable Law, Parent shall (x)
cause its board of directors to appoint one (1) person designated by the
Company prior to the First Effective Time to serve on Parents board of
directors and (y) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such person
to be nominated for election to, and to be elected to, Parents board at the
first annual meeting of Parents stockholders following such appointment. For
the avoidance of doubt, no obligation shall exist with respect to the next
annual meeting of the Parents stockholders or thereafter.

 



 

1.05 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, each share of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled
and extinguished and converted into the right to receive from Parent and
Surviving Company that portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to, and
distributable with respect to, such share of Company Stock in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation (including each certificate of designations,
including the priority of payment or distribution provisions and valuation of
non-cash consideration provisions thereof upon the occurrence of a Liquidation
Event), as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Concurrent
with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent (i)
a schedule (the " _Consideration Spreadsheet_ ") showing, among other matters,
the amount of Closing Merger Consideration to be received by the holder of
Company Stock at the First Effective Time as provided for in this _Section
1.05_, and the amount of each Milestone Payment to be received by each holder
of Company Stock upon payment of such Milestone Payment as provided for in
this _Section 1.05_ and _Section 1.08_, based on the assumptions set forth
in such annex, and (ii) a schedule (the " _New Debt Conversion Spreadsheet_ ")
showing, among other matters, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received by each holder of New Debt at the First Effective Time, based on
the assumptions set forth in such annex, as provided for pursuant to this
Agreement and the terms of the New

 



      
 

 



 

Debt. The Consideration Spreadsheet shall include, among other things, as of
the Closing, all Stockholders and their addresses, the number and type of
shares of capital stock of the Company held by such Stockholder, the
respective certificate numbers, as applicable, the date of acquisition of such
shares, and such other information reasonably available to the Company that
Parent may reasonably request. The New Debt Conversion Spreadsheet shall
include, among other things, as of the Closing, the holder of New Debt, the
aggregate principal amount of New Debt held by such person, the date of
acquisition of such New Debt, and such other information reasonably available
to the Company that Parent may reasonably request. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the portion of each Milestone Payment actually allocable to, and
distributable with respect to, each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time pursuant to this
_Section 1.05_ and _Section 1.08_ may differ from that set forth in the
Consideration Spreadsheet to the extent the Milestone Payments are achieved or
paid in a different order than that set forth in the Consideration
Spreadsheet, or to the extent that there are adjustments to the Milestone
Payments by reason of indemnifiable Losses or otherwise.

 



 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock and each share of Company Preferred
Stock, if any, held immediately prior to the First Effective Time by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company (including shares held in treasury) shall be
canceled and extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 



 

(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and become one (1) validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Company.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event will the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock (i)
issuable in the Mergers as Closing Merger Consideration, (ii) payable as
severance to Arthur G. Altschul, Jr. or Gerald McMahon, Ph.D., and (iii)
issued upon conversion of the New Debt exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock outstanding on the trading day immediately before the date
hereof (as appropriately adjusted for any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon).

 



 

(d) As of the Second Effective Time, all shares of common stock of the Company
issued and outstanding following the First Effective Time shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist. At the Second Effective Time, each
common unit of Merger Sub II that is issued and outstanding immediately prior

common unit of the Surviving Company. Such common unit shall be the only
equity interest of the Surviving Company issued and outstanding immediately
after the Second Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent may
cause to be paid to each Stockholder who has not delivered an Investor
Questionnaire certifying such Stockholders status as an Accredited Investor,
including those listed on _Section 1.05(e)_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedules, against surrender of the Company Stock held by such Stockholder,
cash in lieu of Closing Merger Shares; _provided that_ , the allocation and
distribution of Closing Merger Consideration shall be in compliance with
_Section 1.05_, but with such Stockholder only receiving cash.

 



      
 

 



 

1.06 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) Computershare Inc. (or another qualified exchange agent chosen by Parent)
shall act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the First Merger
and for any future Parent Common Stock issuances and payments to be made to
the Stockholders hereunder. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent for
exchange and payment in accordance with this _Article I_ shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Parent
Common Stock sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 1.05_,
payable pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_, in each case, in
accordance with the provisions of an exchange agent agreement to be executed
at the First Effective Time in forms reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make such payments of cash and shares
of Parent Common Stock to the Stockholders in accordance with the terms of
this _Article I_.

 



 

(c) At the First Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, (ii) no holder of record of a
certificate that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of the Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall have any
rights as a stockholder of the Company and (iii) each Certificate (x)
representing any outstanding shares of Company Stock shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares as set forth in this Agreement and any dividends or
distributions provided for in _Section 1.06(h)_ below, and (y) representing
any Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
payments described in _Section 1.09_.

 



 

(d) Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate immediately prior to the
First Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal in the form of _Exhibit D_
attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") specifying that delivery
shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss containing customary indemnification obligations in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration to which
such holder may be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.05_ hereof and any
dividends or distributions provided for in _Section 1.06(h)_ below, (iii)
solely with respect to the Persons identified on _Exhibit E_ hereto (such
Persons, the " _Lock-up Persons_ "), a lock-up agreement (the " _Lock-Up
Agreement_ ") in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_; and (iv) an
investor questionnaire (to the extent a completed and executed Investor
Questionnaire has not been received by the Company prior to the Closing) in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Investor Questionnaire_ ").
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or
delivery of affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), together with such Letter of
Transmittal, Investor Questionnaire and, solely in the case of the Lock-up
Persons, a Lock-Up Agreement, each duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a payment of the applicable amount of
Merger Consideration provided in _Section 1.05_ with respect to such
Certificate and any dividends or distributions provided for in _Section
1.06(h)_ below and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt of each
properly surrendered Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
cause the Exchange Agent to issue to such Stockholder the Closing Merger
Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) representing that
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration to which such Stockholder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.05_, together with any dividends or
distributions provided for in _Section 1.06(h)_ below. To each holder of a
properly surrendered Certificate (or affidavit of loss containing customary
indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

obligations delivered in lieu thereof), at the time and in the manner set
forth in _Section 1.05_ and _Section 1.08_, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to, as applicable (i) pay the applicable amount of the Milestone
Consideration provided in _Section 1.08_ to such holder, in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such
holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such Certificate (or
affidavit in lieu thereof), and (ii) issue to such Stockholder any shares of
Parent Common Stock representing that portion of the Milestone Consideration
to which such Stockholder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.05_ and _Section
1.08_. The Stockholders Representative shall provide the Parent with
directions, in the form of an updated Consideration Spreadsheet, for further
delivery to the Exchange Agent, as to whom, and the amount, to be paid to each
Stockholder with respect to such Milestone Payment (recognizing that such
instructions may change with respect to each Milestone Payment). The Exchange
Agent shall rely upon all tax forms used and collected by the Exchange Agent
in connection with all payments made at Closing. If reasonably requested by
Exchange Agent, Parent shall provide any additional information in its
possession necessary to complete the required tax reporting. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the First Effective
Time represented shares of Company Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will
be deemed from and after the First Effective Time, for all purposes, to
evidence the right to receive payments of the applicable amounts provided in
_Sections 1.05_ and _1.08_ , together with any dividends or distributions
provided for in _Section 1.06(h)_ below. If, after the First Effective Time,
any Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, Surviving Company or
Parent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
1.06_. No interest shall be paid or accrued after the First Effective Time on
any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be
made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered (or for which an affidavit of loss was delivered), it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered (or affidavit of
loss) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax was paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(e) At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall thereafter be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time on the records of the Company. After the First Effective Time,
no transfer of Company Stock shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company or otherwise. From and after the First
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing such shares
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by any applicable Laws.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the funds received by the Exchange Agent (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) which remains unclaimed by the
Stockholders for one (1) year after the date of payment to the Exchange Agent
shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any Company Stockholder that has
not theretofore surrendered any Certificate and submitted a Letter of
Transmittal, Investor Questionnaire and, if applicable, a Lock-Up Agreement,
in accordance with the requirements set forth therein and in this _Article
I_, or otherwise received any portion of the Merger Consideration due and
payable to such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, shall thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of any applicable Certificate
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).

 



 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each
holder of shares of Company Stock converted pursuant to the First Merger who
would otherwise have been

 



      
 

 



 

entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding) in
an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the Average Closing Price (in the case of Closing Merger
Consideration), or the applicable Parent Stock Value (in the case of a
Milestone Payment).

 



 

(h) _Distributions with Respect to Un-Exchanged Certificates_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the First Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the First Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any un-surrendered Certificate until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Section 1.06_. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and
paid to the record holder of the Certificate, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, without interest, and at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date after the
First Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender that are payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

1.07 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by such record holder, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay
to the record holder of such Certificate the applicable amounts of the Merger
Consideration provided in _Section 1.05_ (together with any dividends or
distributions provided for in _Section 1.06(h)_ above) to be paid in respect
of the shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require such
record holder to indemnify the Surviving Company against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate.

(2) On a country-by-country basis, if a Kolltan Product is sold in the form of
a Combination Product in a country, Net Sales shall be calculated as follows:

 



 

a) Where all active ingredients in such Combination Product are sold
separately in such country, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying
actual Net Sales of such Combination Product in such country as determined
under the first paragraph of this _Section 1.08(a)(xvi)_ by the fraction
A/(A+B), where A is the net invoice price of the Kolltan Product as sold
separately in such country, and B is the sum of the net invoice prices of the
Other Active(s) in the combination.

 



 

b) If the Kolltan Product component of the Combination Product is sold
separately in such country, but none of such Other Active(s) is sold
separately in such country, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying
actual Net Sales of such Combination Product in such country as determined
under the first paragraph of this _Section 1.08(a)(xvi)_ by the fraction A/C,
where A is the net invoice price of such Kolltan Product component as sold
separately in such country, and C is the net invoice price of the Combination
Product in such country.

 



 

c) If the Kolltan Product component of the Combination Product is not sold
separately in such country, but the Other Active(s) are sold separately in
such country, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying actual Net Sales of
such Combination Product in such country as determined under the first
paragraph of this _Section 1.08(a)(xvi)_ by the fraction (C-D)/C, where C is
the net invoice price of the Combination Product in such country, and D is the
sum of the net invoice prices charged for the Other Active(s) in the
Combination Product in such country.

 



 

d) If none of the Kolltan Product component and the Other Active(s) are sold
separately in such country, Net Sales for the purpose of determining royalties
due hereunder for the Combination Product shall be reasonably determined in
good faith by Parent taking into account the perceived relative value
contributions of the Kolltan Product portion of the Combination Product and
the Other Active(s) in the Combination Product.

 



       
 

 



 

For clarification, sale of Kolltan Product by Parent, its Affiliates or a
Product Transferee to a Related Party for resale shall not be deemed a sale
for purposes of this definition of "Net Sales," provided that the subsequent
resale to the first third party that is not a Related Party of Parent, its
Affiliates or a Product Transferee is included in the computation of Net
Sales. Further, transfers or dispositions of Kolltan Product, without
consideration: (A) in connection with patient assistance programs; (B) for
charitable or promotional purposes; (C) for preclinical, clinical, regulatory
or governmental purposes or under so-called "named patient" or other limited
access programs; or (D) for use in any tests or studies reasonably necessary
to comply with Law, regulation or request by a Regulatory Authority, shall
not, in each case of (A) through (D), be deemed sales of such Kolltan Product

prior to the date such Milestone is achieved (as adjusted, if applicable and
appropriate, to reflect any reclassification, stock split, reverse stock
split, dividend, distribution or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock effected (or for which a record date is established) on or after
the first day of such five (5) trading day period and on or prior to the date
such Milestone is achieved). In the event that (i) the Parent Common Stock is
no longer listed on Nasdaq or another national exchange (whether as a result
of a merger of Parent into another Person, the acquisition of Parent or
otherwise) and (ii) the common stock of Parents acquirer or successor-in-
interest is listed on Nasdaq or another national exchange, then such common
stock shall be deemed to be Parent Common Stock for the purposes of this
Agreement, including calculating the Parent Stock Value. In the event that at
the time of the Milestone Payment, if any, the Parent Common Stock or the
common stock of the Parents successor in interest, if any, is no longer
listed on the Nasdaq or any other national exchange, the Parent Stock Value
shall be the fair market value thereof as reasonably determined in good faith
by the board of the Parent or its successor in interest, as the case may be.

 



 

(xix) " _Partnership Agreement_ " means, with respect to any Surviving Company

indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to
determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the
drug, as further described in 21 C.F.R. § 312.21(b) or its successor
regulation, including any equivalent clinical trial conducted in any country
other than the United States. For clarity, "Phase II Clinical Trial" includes
the Phase II portion of any phase I/II Clinical Trial and a Phase II(b)
Clinical Trial refers to a second well-controlled Phase II Clinical Trial
specifically designed to

the case of a Clinical Trial involving a Celldex Compound or Celldex Early
Stage Compound, six (6) months following the database lock for such Clinical
Trial or (B) public disclosure of any results of such Clinical Trial, in each
case such that continued development of such Surviving Company Compound is
warranted on the basis of the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts.
Database lock would occur when a reasonable level of follow-up has been
achieved to satisfy a positive or a negative determination of the primary
endpoint of the study. In the case of a pre-clinical study, Successful
Completion shall mean the achievement of data (to be reviewed as promptly as
practicable following its generation) which warrants the continuation of
research efforts through the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

Milestone Payment may be paid only one time, if at all. In addition, the first
Milestone Payment to be paid (x) shall be accompanied by payment of the
Closing Shortfall, if any, and (y) shall be reduced by Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000).

 



 

(c) _Payment of Milestone Payments_.

 



 

(i) _Form of Payment_. Any Milestone Payment shall be payable at Parents
sole election in cash, in shares of Parent Common Stock based on the Parent
Stock Value, or a combination of both. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a sufficient
portion of each Milestone Payment and any payment due to Stockholders in
connection with _Section 1.13_ to be paid in Parent Common Stock such that
the Mergers will satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirements set forth
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) and other applicable Law. In
furtherance thereof, Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, at the Parents 2017 annual stockholder meeting scheduled to commence
in June of 2017, but in any event prior to August 31, 2017, any consent of the
shareholders of Parent required to permit the issuance of sufficient Parent
Common Stock in satisfaction of the Milestone Payments such that the Merger
Consideration will so be comprised. Any Stockholder that is unable to deliver
an Investor Questionnaire with its Letter of Transmittal certifying such
Stockholders status as an Accredited Investor shall not be entitled to any
Milestone Consideration Shares, unless otherwise determined by Parent, but
instead shall be paid cash in lieu of Milestone Consideration Shares; provided
that, the allocation and distribution of Milestone Consideration shall be in
compliance with _Section 1.05_ but with such Stockholder only receiving cash
by wire of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
such Stockholder. In the event that any cash payment is made in lieu of the
issuance of any Milestone Consideration Shares, Parent shall at all times take
into account its obligations set forth above in this _Section 1.08(c)(i)_
with respect to issuing a minimum percentage of the Merger Consideration in
the aggregate, determined by value, in the form of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) _Notice of Achievement_. Parent shall notify Stockholders Representative
in writing of the achievement of each Milestone by Parent, its Affiliate, or a
Product Transferee within ten (10) Business Days after the date of achievement
of such Milestone (each, a " _Milestone Notice_ "); provided that, with
respect to the First Kolltan Commercial Milestone, the Milestone Notice, if
any, shall be due to the Stockholders Representative within thirty (30) days
of the end of the calendar month in which the First Kolltan Commercial
Milestone is achieved.

 



 

(iii) _Delivery of Milestone Payments_. Subject to the provisions of _Section
7.06_, within ten (10) days following the delivery by Parent of the Milestone
Notice related to the achievement of any Milestone, Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent, for further distribution to the
applicable Stockholders, the total amount of the Milestone Payment, and shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make such distributions. The Exchange Agent shall
be responsible for distributing each Milestone Payment it receives, if any, to
each Stockholder in accordance with an allocation (determined in accordance
with _Section 1.05_) provided for such Milestone Payment by the Stockholders
Representative.

 



 

(iv) _Adjustments_. Each Milestone Payment shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.06_ below.

 



 

(d) _Parent Obligations_.

 



 

(i) _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. During the Efforts Period, Parent
shall, directly and/or through its Affiliates and/or Product Transferees, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to develop and commercialize the Surviving
Company Assets. For the avoidance of doubt: (A) activities performed by or on
behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

Parents Affiliates, and/or any Product Transferees and/or other contractors
engaged by Parent (or any of its Affiliates or Product Transferees, as the
case may be), shall be deemed to be activities performed by Parent for the
purposes of assessing Parents fulfillment of its obligations under the
preceding sentence to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts; (B) the obligations
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts set forth in this _Section 1.08(d)_
shall not be deemed a representation, warranty, or guarantee that any
Milestone will be achieved; (C) Parent and the Surviving Company shall have
sole discretion (but acting reasonably) over all matters relating to the
Surviving Company Assets after the First Effective Time, including, but not
limited to, any research, development, manufacturing, commercialization,
clinical trial design, site selection, regulatory, quality standards, legal,
intellectual property rights, marketing, licensing and sales decisions
relating to the Surviving Company Assets; and (D) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company owes any fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to any
Stockholder, and Parent hereby disclaims (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and Product Transferees), and the Stockholders Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders) hereby irrevocably waives, any obligations with
respect to development, seeking Marketing Approval for, or commercialization
of, any Surviving Company Asset, or the achievement of any of the Milestones,
whether arising under applicable Law or otherwise, except in the cases of each
of clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) above for the obligation to use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts set forth in the first sentence of this _Section
1.08(d)(i)_.

 



 

(e) _Milestone Abandonment_. In the event that Parent determines in good faith
that a Milestone will not be achieved, Parent shall promptly notify the
Stockholders Representative in writing of such determination (any such notice,
a " _Milestone Abandonment Notice_ "). Upon the Stockholders Representatives
written request, Parent shall make available a representative of Parent with
direct responsibility for the development of the Surviving Company Asset to
which the abandoned Milestone relates and such other of its employees as
Parent may reasonably deem appropriate, who will respond to reasonable
inquiries of the Stockholders Representative with respect to such Milestone
Abandonment Notice. The Milestone Abandonment Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the reasons the applicable determination was made.

 



 

(f) _Disposal Restrictions_. During the Efforts Period, neither Parent nor its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) shall transfer, sell, license or
assign, to any third Person who is not an Affiliate of Parent, all or any
rights pertaining to the Surviving Company Assets, including as a part of a
sale that includes all or any of the assets of the Surviving Company or all of
the equity interests of, or a merger with, the Surviving Company, unless the
transferee, licensee or assignee, as applicable, of such transfer, sale,
license or assignment is reasonably determined to be financially capable of
performing, and has the experience or expertise to perform, the obligations of
Parent and such entity assumes the obligations of Parent under this _Section
1.08_, including payment of the Milestone Payments (except to the extent
previously paid), in a writing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Stockholders Representative and thereafter Parent shall no longer be
responsible for the performance of such obligations.

 



 

(g) _Milestone Payments Not Certain_. Without limiting Parents obligations
under this _Section 1.08_, each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of themselves and each of the
Stockholders), on the other, hereby acknowledge that the achievement of any
Milestone is uncertain and it is therefore not assured that Parent will be
required to pay (or cause to be paid) any Milestone Payment at all if no
Milestone described in _Section 1.08(b)_ is achieved by Parent, or any of its
Affiliates or Product Transferees.

 



 

(h) _Milestone Payments Not a Security_. The Parties do not intend the right
of the Stockholders to receive any Milestone Payment to be a security.
Accordingly, the right of a Stockholder to receive any Milestone Payment (1)
shall not be represented by a certificate, (2) does not represent an ownership
interest in Parent or the Surviving Company, and (3) does not entitle a
Stockholder to any rights

 



      
 

 



 

common to equity holders of Parent or the Surviving Company, other than as
expressly set forth herein. The right of a Stockholder to receive Milestone
Payments pursuant to this Agreement shall not be transferable without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any attempted or purported transfer in
violation of this _Section 1.08(h)_ will be null and void.

 



 

(i) _Stockholders Representative Audit Rights_. Stockholders Representative,
through its authorized employees, representatives, agents, partners and
consultants, upon giving reasonable notice to Parent, shall have the right,
upon reasonable advance notice and at its or the Stockholders sole expense,
and during normal business hours, no more frequently than twice per calendar
year, (A) to inspect at reasonable times and at reasonable places, all
facilities, equipment, procedures, and practices employed by Parent or its
Affiliates in connection with any matter relating any activity that could
reasonably be related to, or could reasonably lead to, achievement of any
Milestone or payment of any Milestone Payment or relates to the basis or facts
upon which any Milestone is or is not achieved, any Milestone Payment is or is
not earned, or any indemnification, holdback or set off claim against any
Milestone Payment is made (the " _Contingency Activities_ "), and (B) to
examine and audit all books, records, files, notebooks, relevant operating
procedures, and data of Parent and its Affiliates relating to (i) the
Contingency Activities, including to assess the status of such activities and
to assess whether any Milestone Payments should be paid, (ii) any
indemnification or set-off claims pursuant to Article VII, including to
determine the facts and circumstances thereof, and (iii) Parent and its
Affiliates compliance with this Agreement. The foregoing includes the right
to speak to key personnel related to any Contingency Activity. Any such
inspection examination or audit shall be subject to appropriate and customary
obligations of confidentiality and non-use and may only be performed by such
entities and personnel to which Parent has no reasonable objection; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not restrict the Stockholders Representative
from communicating information to the Stockholders to the extent reasonably
necessary to the performance of its duties as the Stockholders Representative,
subject to appropriate and customary undertakings of confidentiality and non-
use.

 



 

1.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and that is held by a Company Common Stockholder or Company
Preferred Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and
enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement,
which Company Common Stockholder or Company Preferred Stockholder complies
with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection
of appraisal rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such
Company Common Stockholder or Company Preferred Stockholder being a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such share of Company Stock
would be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.05_ but rather shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect its appraisal rights under the
DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to
any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration referred to in
_Section 1.05_ (together with any dividends or distributions provided for in
_Section 1.06(h)_ above). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, if the First Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the
right of a Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company
shall give Parent (a) notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of
any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for
payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to any Stockholders appraisal rights and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands for payment under the DGCL. The Company shall not (x)
voluntarily make any

 



      
 

 



 

payment with respect to any demand for appraisal with respect to any
Dissenting Shares and/or (y) offer to settle or settle any demand, in either
case, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 



 

1.10 _Updated Consideration Spreadsheet and New Debt Conversion Spreadsheet_.
At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent an updated Consideration Spreadsheet and updated New Debt
Conversion Spreadsheet, which updated Consideration Spreadsheet and updated
New Debt Conversion Spreadsheet shall include any reasonable comments from
Parent. The Consideration Spreadsheet may continue to be updated following
Closing by the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders
in connection with any distribution of Merger Consideration to be made after
the Closing Date.

 



 

1.11 _Closing Cash Certificate_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate (the "
_Closing Cash Certificate_ "), signed by its chief executive officer (in his
capacity as such), certifying the Companys good faith estimate of the Closing
Cash (such estimate, as adjusted pursuant to the next sentence of this
_Section 1.11_ " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), with reasonably detailed
documentation supporting such amount. If prior to the Closing Date, Parent
disputes all or any portion of the Closing Cash Certificate, an authorized
officer of the Company and Parent shall promptly meet and seek in good faith
to resolve the dispute(s) and if and to the extent that the Company and Parent
are unable to resolve any such dispute(s), then the amount of the disputed
item(s) so asserted by Parent in good faith shall be deemed to be the amount
included as part of the Closing Cash Certificate for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration.

 



 

1.12 _Final Calculations; Disputes_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following Closing, but in any event within six
(6) months after the Closing Date, Parent will deliver a reasonably detailed
statement setting forth Parents calculations of the Closing Cash (the "
_Closing Statement_ "). After delivery of the Closing Statement, the
Stockholders Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable
access during normal business hours to review the Companys books and records
and any work papers (including any work papers of Parents and the Companys
accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement, subject to
such confidentiality restrictions as the accountants shall reasonably request.
The Stockholders Representative and its accountants may make reasonable
inquiries of Parent, the Surviving Company and their accountants and employees
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and Parent shall use, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries.

 



 

(b) If the Stockholders Representative has any objections to the Closing
Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall deliver a written notice to
Parent (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth the basis for such objections
in reasonable detail, including, to the extent practicable, (i) each item or
amount on the Closing Statement to which the Stockholders Representative
objects, and (ii) the Stockholders Representatives calculation of each such
objected item or amount. If a Dispute Notice is not delivered to Parent within
forty five (45) days after the Stockholders Representatives receipt of the
Closing Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have
irrevocably consented to and accepted as final, on behalf of the Stockholders,
the Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and
non-appealable by the Parties. If a Dispute Notice is delivered to Parent
within forty five (45) days after the Stockholders Representatives receipt of
the Closing Statement, the Stockholders Representative and Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the
Dispute Notice, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30)
days after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Stockholders Representative
and Parent shall submit such dispute to an independent accountant of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Stockholders Representative (who shall not be either partys independent
registered public accounting firm) (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If any
dispute is submitted to the Independent Accountant, each of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative will furnish to the Independent Accountant such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request and are available
to such Party or its accountants (including information of the Company) and
each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to
present the Independent Accountant material relating to its determination of
the Closing Statement and to discuss, whether or not in the presence of any
other Party, its determination of the Closing Statement with the Independent
Accountant.

 



 

(c) The Independent Accountant shall resolve only those matters that remain in
dispute after the thirty (30) day resolution period. It is the intent of
Parent and the Stockholders Representative that the process set forth in this
_Section 1.12_ and the activities of the Independent Accountant in connection
herewith are not intended to be and, in fact are not, arbitration and that the
Independent Accountant shall act solely as an auditor and not an arbitrator
and no formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including rules with
respect to procedures and discovery). The Stockholders Representative and
Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountant to resolve all such disagreements as soon as
practicable but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after submission
of the disputed issues to the Independent Accountant. The resolution of the
dispute by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding upon the Parties
and non-appealable by either of the Parties. The Closing Statement shall be
modified if necessary to reflect the Independent Accountants determination.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Parent,
on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
the matters resolved by the Independent Accountant, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accountant at the time the determination is rendered on the merits
of the matters submitted to the Independent Accountant.

 



       
 

 



 

1.13 _Adjustments_. Subject to Parents right to terminate under _Section
9.01(g)_, if Estimated Closing Cash is less than negative four million five
hundred thousand dollars (-$4,500,000), then Parent shall be entitled to
reduce the Consideration Amount dollar-for-dollar to the extent the Estimated
Closing Cash amount is less than negative four million five hundred thousand
dollars (-$4,500,000). In the event that (a) Estimated Closing Cash is less
than negative four million five hundred thousand dollars (-$4,500,000), and
(b) the Closing Cash amount, as finally determined by _Section 1.12_ is less
than the Estimated Closing Cash amount, then Parent shall be entitled to set-
off from any Milestone Consideration (but not against any Milestone
Consideration for which payment to the Exchange Agent for further distribution
to the Stockholders is past due) payable to the Stockholders hereunder by such
difference. In the event that (x) Estimated Closing Cash is less than negative
four million five hundred thousand dollars (-$4,500,000), and (y) the Closing
Cash amount, as finally determined by _Section 1.12_ is greater than the
Estimated Closing Cash amount, then Parent shall pay such difference (not to
exceed the difference between Estimated Closing Cash and negative four million
five hundred thousand dollars (-$4,500,000)) to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the Stockholders at the time of payment of the next Milestone
Payment to be paid after final determination of the Closing Cash as
contemplated by _Section 1.12_. Subject to the requirements _Section
1.08(c)(i)_ with respect to continuity of interest, any amount due to
Stockholders in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be payable at
Parents sole election in cash, in shares of Parent Common Stock based on the
Parent Stock Value, or a combination of both.

 



 

1.14 _Transaction Expenses_.

 



 

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to Parent the amount, in the aggregate, of all
Transaction Expenses that have not been paid prior to Closing and shall
provide Parent with a certificate setting forth (a) the identity of each
Person that is owed such amounts; (b) the amount owed or to be owed to each
such Person; and (c) the bank account and wire transfer information for each
such Person. The Parent shall pay all Transaction Expenses at the Closing.
Parent shall also issue and deliver the Severance Shares to the intended
recipients thereof at the Closing (the number of Severance Shares shall be
determined using the same ratio and methodology as is used to calculate the
Closing Merger Shares).

 



 

(b) The Company shall have paid off and have no Indebtedness (other than the
New Debt) as of the Closing Date. The New Debt shall be converted into shares
of Parent Common Stock (any such shares, the " _New Debt Conversion Shares_ ")
effective as of immediately following the Closing.

 



 

1.15 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Stockholder such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld under any applicable provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving
Company in accordance with the foregoing and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

1.16 _Taking of Further Action_. If, at any time after the First Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this _Article I_ and to vest the Surviving Company with full right, title
and possession to all assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II, Parent and the Surviving Company are
fully authorized in their respective names to take, and shall take, all such
necessary or desirable action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement, and all such action as may be required by Law.

 



      
 

 



 

1.17 _Treatment of Options_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause all
Options issued by the Company to have been exercised or terminated no later
than immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The cancellation of an Option as provided above shall be deemed a release
of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of
such Option.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the
compensation committee of the Company, as applicable), shall take all actions
as may be reasonably necessary or required in accordance with applicable Laws,
the Company Stock Plans or the award agreements applicable to such Options to
effectuate all of the actions contemplated by this _Section 1.17_, including
giving any required notice under the Company Stock Plan.

 



 

1.18 _Specified Stockholder Support Agreements_. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, Company shall deliver to Parent a duly executed
Support Agreement from the Stockholders set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Specified Stockholders_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE II

The Company represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub, subject

of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to apply to and qualify
the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance
of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face), on the date hereof and
(except where a representation or warranty is made herein as of a specified

2.02 _Subsidiaries_. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a limited
liability company, corporation or other organization, duly organized, validly

Documents of the Company, or (B) violate any Law to which the Company is

Company as currently conducted or (B) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) over any property or assets of the
Company, excluding any Liens not created by the actions of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Section 2.03(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth all
necessary consents, waivers and approvals of parties to any Material Contracts
as are required thereunder in connection with the Mergers, or for any such
Material Contract to remain in full force and effect without limitation,
modification or alteration after the First Effective Time so as to preserve
all rights of, and benefits to, the Company under such Contracts from and
after the First Effective Time, in all material respects.

 



 

2.04 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 202,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 23,268,339
shares are issued and outstanding and 160,000,000 authorized shares of Company
Preferred Stock, 40,000,000 of which are designated as Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, of which 40,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding;
10,000,000 of which are designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, of
which 9,090,909 shares are issued and outstanding; 24,999,999 of which are
designated as Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 15,000,000 shares
are issued and outstanding; and 60,000,000 of which are designated as Series D

(b) All the outstanding shares of Company Stock have been duly and validly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and were issued in accordance
with the registration or qualification requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") and any relevant state securities
Laws or pursuant to valid exemptions therefrom and were not issued in
violation of the pre-emptive rights of any Person or any Contract or
applicable Law by which the Company was bound as the time of the issuance.
Except as set forth in _Section 2.04(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules
and for any conversion privileges of the Company Preferred Stock or the rights
provided pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement (which agreement will
terminate effective as of the First Effective Time), there are no shares of
Company Stock or any other equity security of the Company issuable upon
conversion or exchange of any issued and outstanding security of the Company
nor are there any rights, options outstanding or other agreements to acquire
shares of Company Stock or any other equity security of the Company nor is the
Company contractually obligated to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
of its outstanding shares that would survive the Closing. No Stockholder is
entitled to any preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for shares of
capital stock of the Company that would survive the Closing. Except as set
forth on _Section 2.04(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, there will be
no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any shares of
capital stock of the Company as of the First Effective Time other than certain

shall not authorize or permit) its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information or assistance), or induce, or knowingly
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any

 



      
 

 



 

discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than
Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) any non-public information
for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of its Board of Directors that the stockholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement, or recommend, adopt or approve any Company Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), a " _Recommendation
Withdrawal_ "), (iv) grant (other than to Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives) any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement (except that the Company may grant a limited waiver of any provision
of any such standstill or similar agreement solely to the extent necessary to
permit a Person to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal), or (v) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any understanding or agreement
contemplating or otherwise relating to, or that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify
Parent orally, with written confirmation to follow, of the Companys receipt
of any written Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify,
except to the extent prohibited by a confidentiality agreement in existence as
of the date hereof, the name of the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 4.03(a)_, prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the requisite Stockholder Consent, the Company may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 4.03_, (i) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company to any Person (and the Representatives of such Person)
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms not materially less
restrictive with respect to confidentiality of the other party than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided
to Parent promptly after its execution), and may (ii) negotiate and
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning a
Company Acquisition Proposal (including solicitation of revised Company
Acquisition Proposals), but only if, (x) such Person has on an unsolicited
basis, submitted a bona fide, written proposal to the Company relating to any
such transaction which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from outside counsel and its financial advisors, would be or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) in the good faith
opinion of the Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
legal counsel to the Company, the failure to provide such information or
access or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would cause the
Companys Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) notify Parent orally, with written confirmation
to follow, of the Companys receipt of any written Company Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall identify, except to the extent prohibited by a
confidentiality agreement in existence as of the date hereof, the name of the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any material non-public information regarding the Company
provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to Parent, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other Person. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal made by a third party that did not result from the breach by the
Company or any of its Representatives of _Section 4.03_, in each case on
terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) in good
faith by resolution duly adopted (A) would result in a transaction that, if
consummated, is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their
capacity as stockholders) from a financial point of view than the Mergers,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise pursuant to _Section 4.03(e)_), and (B) is reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Any violation of this _Section 4.03_ by any of the Companys
Representatives shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement by
the Company.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth herein, neither the Companys Board of Directors nor
any committee thereof shall (i) make a Recommendation Withdrawal or (ii) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (including _Section 4.03(a)_), prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the requisite Stockholder Consent, the Companys
Board of Directors may, to the extent required by its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, as determined in good faith by
the Companys Board of Directors after consultation with outside legal
counsel, and subject to the terms of this and the following sentence, make a
Recommendation Withdrawal or enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), in each case at any time
after the third Business Day following the Companys delivery to Parent of
written notice advising Parent that the Companys Board of Directors has
received a Superior Proposal and otherwise in accordance with the notice
requirements set forth in _Section 4.03(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not enter into an Acquisition Agreement or make a
Recommendation Withdrawal (as a result of a Company Acquisition Proposal)
unless the Company complies with _Section 4.03(e)_. In addition, in the
absence of a Company Acquisition Proposal and prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the requisite Stockholder Consent, the Companys Board of
Directors may, to the extent required by its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, as determined in good faith by the
Companys Board of Directors after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors, make a Recommendation Withdrawal (it being understood
that for purposes of this sentence, such term does not include recommendation,
adoption or approval of any Company Acquisition Proposal) if (i) the Company
shall have provided Parent with written notice that it intends to effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this _Section 4.03(d)_ and describing
the basis for such Recommendation Withdrawal and (ii) within a period of three
full Business Days following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause
(i) above, Parent shall not have proposed adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement which, after having negotiated or caused its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith such
proposed adjustments, the Companys Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment (after considering the advice of its legal counsel and
financial advisors) would result in the recommendation of its Board of
Directors that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement being
consistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders. Any such
Recommendation Withdrawal or the entry by the Company into any Acquisition
Agreement shall not change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be
applicable to the Mergers.

 



 

(e) Prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite Stockholder
Consent, the Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that,
prior to any such termination, (i) the Company shall have provided Parent
written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 4.03(e)_, identifying the Superior Proposal then determined to be
more favorable, the parties thereto and the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) within a period of three full Business Days
following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (i) above, Parent
shall not have proposed adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement which, after having negotiated or caused its financial and legal
advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith such proposed adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors
determines in its good faith judgment (after considering the advice of its
financial advisor) to be as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such
Superior Proposal, and (iii) at least three full Business Days after the
Company has provided the notice referred to in clause (i) above, the Company
shall have delivered to Parent (A) a written notice of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.03(e)_

 



      
 

 



 

and (B) a wire transfer of immediately available funds in the amount of the
Company Termination Fee as the sole remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Sub II.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Companys Board of Directors from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside counsel to the Company, the failure to take
such action would cause the Companys Board of Directors to violate its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 



 

4.04 _Consents_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of and deliver all
required notices to any parties to any Contract listed in _Section 2.03(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

4.05 _Termination of Company Investor Rights_. The Company shall obtain and
deliver to Parent prior to Closing the written termination as of the Closing
of all Stockholder Agreements.

 



 

4.06 _Market Value of Consideration_. In the event that the discount from
market value proposed by the Companys Board of Directors in accordance with
Section 4(d)(ii) of each Certificate of Designation included in the
Certificate of Incorporation is not approved by a minimum of 66.67% of the
outstanding shares of the Company, voting as a single class (on an as
converted to common stock basis), then the Company shall promptly engage an
investment bank or appraiser experienced in appraising financial assets (which
investment bank or appraiser is reasonably acceptable to Parent) to determine
the approximate fair market value (i.e., the discount for lack of
marketability) in accordance with said Section 4(d)(ii).

(b) In connection with the Closing, the Company shall, at its own expense,
purchase a directors and officers liability insurance or tail insurance
policy on terms and conditions (including, without limitation, coverage
limits) reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _D andO Tail_"), that provides
coverage for acts or omissions of the DandO Indemnified Parties occurring on or
prior to the First Effective Time. The premium for the DandO Tail shall be paid
at the Closing, and Parent shall maintain such DandO Tail in effect for the full
term thereof without any amendment or waiver of any provision therein that
would adversely affect in any material respect the rights of the DandO
Indemnified Parties. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.01_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
proposes to (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and Parent or
the Surviving Company shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made prior to or concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, shall, from and after the consummation of such
transaction, honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.01_.

 



 

(d) The Parties agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
First Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company and its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement shall survive the
First Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. The provisions of
this _Section 5.01_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise
available to the current officers and directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.01_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any DandO Indemnified Parties, or any person
who is a beneficiary under the policies referred to in this _Section 5.01_
and their heirs and representatives, without the prior written consent of such
affected DandO Indemnified Party or other person.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.01_ shall survive the consummation of
the First Merger and Second Merger and the First Effective Time and Second
Effective Time and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, and his or her successors, heirs
and Representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Company and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. Parent and the Surviving
Company shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses, that may be incurred by a person in successfully enforcing such
persons rights provided in this _Section 5.01_.

 



 

5.02 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in _Section
6.01)_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing
conditions set forth in _Section 6.02_).

 



 

5.03 _Notification_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, if the Company becomes aware of, or there
occurs after the date of this Agreement, any fact or condition that
constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article II or of any covenant that would cause the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01(a)_ or _Section 6.01(b)_, as applicable, not to be satisfied
as of the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly disclose in writing to
Parent such breach.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, if Parent becomes aware of, or there occurs
after the date of this Agreement, any fact or condition that constitutes a
breach of any representation or warranty made in Article III or any covenant
that would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section
6.02(b)_, as applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, Parent
shall promptly disclose in writing to the Company such breach.

 



 

5.04 _Section 280G_. To the extent applicable payment rights are waived and
280G Waivers obtained or are otherwise not payable absent approval of the
Stockholders, the Company shall promptly, but, in any event, no later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the First Effective Time, submit for approval by
the Stockholders by the requisite vote (and in a manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payment and/or benefits that may, separately or
in the aggregate, constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code ( **"** _Section 280G Payments_") (which
determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent), such that all such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be Section 280G Payments (the **"** _280G Approval_ "), and prior to
the First Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
satisfactory to Parent that a vote of Stockholders was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and
that (a) such requisite 280G Approval was obtained with respect to any Section
280G Payment, or (b) that the 280G Approval was not obtained with respect to
any Section 280G Payment and as a consequence, that Section 280G Payment shall
not be made or provided, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or
benefits which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the vote of
the Stockholders (the " _280G Waivers_ "). Prior to soliciting the 280G
Approval, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Parent a 280G Waiver from each Person who the Company reasonably
believes is, with respect to the Company, a " _disqualified individual_ "
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and who has received or could
otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive any Section 280G
Payments. Prior to obtaining the 280G Waivers described in the previous
sentence, the Company shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Parent a
draft of all solicitation and related documents (including any calculations of
the Section 280G Payments) contemplated in this _Section 5.04_, including any
disclosure documents. The Company shall incorporate any reasonable comments
into such documents that are made timely by Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

5.05 _Termination of Certain Company Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate any and
all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements and the Company Employee Benefit Plans identified on _Section

with evidence that such Company Employee Benefit Plans have been terminated
(contingent upon the occurrence of and effective as of the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent or the Surviving Company shall be responsible for any compliance with
COBRA, as applicable.

 



 

5.06 _Registration of Merger Shares, Severance Shares and New Debt Conversion
Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (and in any event by
not later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date), Parent shall file
with the SEC a Registration Statement under the Securities Act covering the
resale of the Closing Merger Shares, the Severance Shares and the New Debt
Conversion Shares (collectively, the " _Initial Registration Shares_ ").
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement filed under this Agreement to be declared effective as soon as
reasonably practicable after filing and to maintain the continuous
effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the earlier of (A) the date
all such Initial Registration Shares have been sold pursuant to such
Registration Statement, or (B) such time as all holders of such Initial
Registration Shares may sell such Initial Registration Shares under Rule 144
of the Securities Act. For purposes of this _Section 5.06_, Initial
Registration Shares and Milestone Consideration Shares shall include any
Parent Common Stock issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to
or in exchange for or in replacement of any such shares.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within forty-five (45) days)
following the issuance of any Milestone Consideration Shares under this
Agreement, Parent shall file with the SEC, and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause to be declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after
filing, either (i) a Registration Statement covering the resale of such
Milestone Consideration Shares held by the Stockholders, or (ii) in the event
Parent determines that it may register the resale of such Milestone
Consideration Shares under an existing "shelf" Registration Statement, a
prospectus supplement (a " _Prospectus Supplement_ ") under such "shelf"
Registration Statement covering the resale of such Milestone Consideration
Shares. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
continuous effectiveness of each Registration Statement or Prospectus
Supplement, as applicable, until the earlier of (A) the date all such
Milestone Consideration Shares have been sold pursuant to such Registration
Statement or Prospectus Supplement, as applicable, or (B) such time as such
time as all holders of such Milestone Consideration Shares may sell such
Milestone Consideration Shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to keep the Registration
Statements or Prospectus Supplements referenced in clauses (a) and (b)
effective through the dates referenced in clauses (a) and (b) and without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments to such Registration Statements or Prospectus Supplements, as the
case may be and amendments or supplements to the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities
Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all such Merger Shares
included in such Registration Statements or Prospectus Supplements, as the
case may be and (ii) register or qualify such Merger Shares included in such
Registration Statements or Prospectus Supplements, as the case may be, under
the applicable state securities or blue sky laws. Parent shall also use
reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of, or to secure the
withdrawal of, any such stop order as promptly as practicable. Parent shall
notify the Stockholders

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, promptly after it shall receive notice thereof, of the date
and time a Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto
shall have become or been declared effective or an amendment or supplement to
any prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement shall have been
filed with the SEC.

 



 

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the resale
of the Merger Shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act when available to
Stockholders, including (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with its Exchange Act filing requirements, and (ii) upon receipt of
representations reasonably acceptable to Parents counsel that such
Stockholder meets the requirements for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities
Act, obtaining a legal opinion from Parents counsel that such Merger Shares
are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act and any legends
or other restrictions on transfer of such shares may be removed.

 



 

(e) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 5.06(j)_, upon Parents request,
each Stockholder shall furnish to Parent such information regarding such
Stockholder, the Merger Shares held by such Stockholder and the offer and sale
or other distribution proposed by such Stockholder as Parent may reasonably
request, in connection with any registration of the Merger Shares and any
resale of the Merger Shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Parent shall
have no liability hereunder to the extent any of the information supplied or
to be supplied by a Stockholder expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement, or Prospectus Supplement, as
applicable, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(f) All costs, fees, and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and any amendments or
supplements thereto, and any actions or filings necessary to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be at Parents expense,
including all SEC fees, blue sky registration and filing fees, Nasdaq notices
and filing fees, printing fees and expenses, transfer agents and registrars
fees and expenses and all fees and expenses of Parents outside counsel and
independent accountants; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay any brokers fees or similar commissions on any sales of such
shares by or on behalf of any Stockholders.

 



 

(g) Parent may postpone the filing of any Registration Statement (or
Prospectus Supplement) required hereunder for a reasonable period of time, not
to exceed 180 days in the aggregate during any twelve month period, if in the
good faith judgment of Parent following consultation with legal counsel, it
would be detrimental to Parent or its stockholders for resales of Merger
Shares to be made pursuant to any Registration Statement (or Prospectus
Supplement) due to (i) the existence of a material development or potential
material development involving Parent that Parent would be obligated to
disclose or incorporate by reference in such Registration Statement (or
Prospectus Supplement), which disclosure would be premature or otherwise
inadvisable at such time or (ii) interference with an actual or potential
material financing or business combination transaction involving Parent (a "
_Black Out Period_ "). Upon notice of the existence of a Black Out Period from
Parent to any Stockholders with respect to any Registration Statement (or
Prospectus Supplement), such Stockholder shall refrain from selling its Merger
Shares under such Registration Statement (or Prospectus Supplement) until such
Black Out Period has ended. There shall be no more than an aggregate of one
hundred eighty (180) days of Black Out Period in any twelve (12) month period.
In addition, Parent may postpone the filing of any Registration Statement (or
Prospectus Supplement) required hereunder to the extent that such filing would
occur during the period (A) beginning on February 11 of any given calendar
year and (B) ending on the date that is three (3) Business Days after the date
Parent files its audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the then most
recently completed fiscal year.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Stockholders, from and against any Losses to which any
Stockholders may become subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise) to the
extent such Losses arise out of, directly or indirectly, any untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other
document filed in accordance with this _Section 5.06_, or any omission to
state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that Parent will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Losses arising out of,
directly or indirectly, any untrue statement or omission, made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished to Parent by or on behalf of
any Stockholders specifically for use in the preparation of the Registration
Statement. Each Stockholder, on a several basis, shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Parent to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from Parent, but only with reference to
information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Stockholder to
Parent, specifically for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement.
_Sections 7.04_ and _7.05_ shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any claim for
indemnification under this _Section 5.06(h)_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall not be obligated to take any action under this _Section 5.06_
unless and until the following conditions shall have been met: (i) Parent
shall have received any audited financial statements of Company and any other
financial information of Company required for inclusion in the Registration
Statement (or Prospectus Supplement) as reasonably determined by Parent, (ii)
Parent shall have received all information it reasonably needs to prepare pro
forma financial statements if required to be included in the Registration
Statement (or Prospectus Supplement) under SEC rules, and (iii) Parent shall
have received such auditor consents from its and the Companys auditors as it
reasonably deems necessary or desirable. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts, acting in good faith, to cause such conditions to be
satisfied. If a Stockholder fails to furnish to Parent the information
regarding such Stockholder as is necessary for inclusion in the Registration
Statement within thirty (30) days of Stockholders receipt of Parents written
request (including any such information requested in accordance with _Section
5.06(e)_), the Merger Shares held by such Stockholder and the offer and sale
or other distribution proposed by such Stockholder as Parent may reasonably
request, the Parent is not required to include any such Stockholders Merger
Shares in the Registration Statement.

 



 

5.07 _Provision of Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent such financial
statements of the Company as Parent shall reasonably request in order to
enable Parent to comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act
(including its obligation to file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K
containing all information required by Items 2 and 9 of the SECs Form 8-K
(without regard to the time period in which such information must be filed)),
together with executed reports of the outside auditors with respect to all
such financial statements that have been audited. Such reports shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The financial statements
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and shall conform to all provisions of the SECs Regulation S-X,
such that such financial statements are suitable for filing by Parent with the
SEC in response to Items 2 and 9 of the SECs Current Report on Form 8-K. The
Company shall cause such outside auditors to deliver to Parent executed
consents, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and suitable
for filing by Parent with the SEC, which consents shall authorize Parent to
file with the SEC the reports referred to in this _Section 5.07_ and all
other reports delivered by the Company hereunder; provided, however, that
Parent must provide Company a final Form 8-K at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the proposed filing date so it can be provided to its auditors to
obtain the requested consent.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) On or prior to November 9, 2016, the Company shall deliver to Parent
unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated
statements of changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders deficit
and consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine (9) month period then
ended, certified by the chief financial officer of the Company (solely in his
or her capacity as such) as, to the knowledge and belief of such chief
financial officer, complete and correct in all material respects, subject to
year-end adjustments and lack of footnotes, as of the Closing Date; provided
that such certificate shall not be deemed inaccurate or incorrect to the
extent such inaccuracy or error arises out of or is related to any adjustments
in such financial statement required by Parent to the extent not required by
GAAP.

 



 

5.08 _Certain Employee Matters_. Subject to the execution of a general release
of claims in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent within 21
days after presentation thereof (or such longer period as may be required by
law), Parent shall offer each Employee (other than an Employee who is party to
an Employee Agreement that provides for severance) terminated by Parent on, or
within sixty (60) days following, the Closing Date, (i) that does not receive
a transaction completion bonus granted by the Company prior to Closing (those
persons who are receiving such transaction completion bonuses are set forth on
_Section 5.08(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) in connection with the
Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement two (2) months of
severance payments at the rate such Employee is being paid on the date hereof
as set forth on _Section 2.13(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules
(payable in accordance with Parents customary payroll practices commencing on
the next regular payroll date following the effectiveness of the release),
(ii) reimbursement for continuation of medical coverage in accordance with the
provisions of COBRA at active employee rates under the applicable plan for two
(2) months following the termination of the medical coverage in accordance
with the terms of the applicable medical plan, subject to the applicable
Employees timely election of continuation coverage and continued eligibility
to receive COBRA coverage, and the terms and conditions of the Parents
medical plan (the " _Health Benefits_ "); provided, that such Health Benefits
shall immediately cease as of the date the applicable Employee becomes
eligible for coverage under the group medical plan of a new employer and (iii)
a cash payout equal to such Employees accrued but unpaid vacation time at
such Employees salary rate on the date hereof as set forth on _Section
2.13(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules (payable in a lump sum on the
next regular payroll date following the termination of employment, unless
sooner required by law and, for the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of the
amounts under this clause (iii) are not subject to execution of the release).
Parent may modify its obligation to provide the Health Benefits if required by
applicable law and/or to avoid any penalty or excise taxes imposed on it (or
the Employee) in connection with the continued payment of premiums by the
Company under the Code or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010, as amended, each as determined by Parent in its good faith reasonable
discretion; provided that Parent will use reasonable commercial efforts to
cause such modifications not to result in an increase in cost to the affected
employee to acquire equivalent Health Benefits.

ARTICLE VII

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

7.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any other certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date which is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Date_ ");
_provided, however_ , that the Fundamental Representations (other than the
Specified Intellectual Property Representations and the representations and
warranties in _Section 2.08_ (Tax Matters)) shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
_provided further, however_ that (i) the Specified Intellectual Property
Representations shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date
which is five (5) years after the Closing Date and (ii) the representations
and warranties in _Section 2.08_ (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate upon the thirtieth (30th) day after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. No claim for indemnification hereunder for
breach of any such representations and warranties may be made after the
expiration of such survival period; _provided, however_ , that all
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or
any other certificate or

 



      
 

 



 

instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive beyond the
survival periods specified above with respect to any inaccuracy therein or
breach thereof if a claim is made hereunder prior to the expiration of the
survival period for such representation and warranty, in which case such
representation and warranty shall survive as to such claim until such claim
has been finally resolved.

 



 

(b) The agreements, covenants and other obligations of the Parties hereto
shall survive the Closing and the First Effective Time in accordance with
their terms.

 



 

7.02 _Indemnification by the Stockholders._ After the Closing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Article VII_, the Company Indemnifying Parties,
severally and not jointly, to the extent of a Company Indemnifying Partys
respective interest in the Milestone Consideration not yet paid to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders (but not against Milestone
Consideration for which payment to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
Stockholders is past due), solely by set-off pursuant to _Section 7.06_
against the Milestone Consideration, will indemnify and hold harmless Parent
from and against, whether or not involving a third party claim, all Losses
incurred by Parent, directly or indirectly, relating to or arising from (a)
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company in
_Article II_ of this Agreement, (b) any Indemnified Tax, (c) any payments
required to be made to any stockholder of the Company with respect to any
claims arising from or with respect to the allocation or distribution of
Merger Consideration following Parents payment to the Exchange Agent of the
correct aggregate amount of Merger Consideration (collectively, the "
_Consideration Spreadsheet Losses_ "), (d) any payments made by the Surviving
Company or Parent pursuant to any continuing obligation to indemnify any
officer or director of the Company for actions taken, or omissions made, prior
to the Closing Date or (e) any payments required to be made to any stockholder
of the Company with respect to such stockholders appraisal rights under the
DGCL (" _Appraisal Rights Payments_ ") solely to the extent such payments are
in excess of the Merger Consideration that such stockholder would otherwise
have received and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Surviving
Company or Parent in connection with any Actions or settlements in connection
therewith, provided, however, that if Parent settles any such Actions without
the Stockholders Representatives consent, then the cost of such settlement
shall not be recoverable under this _Article VII_. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any Losses arising directly or indirectly from
any post-Closing (i) acts or omissions by Parent or the Surviving Company
which result in a change of facts or circumstances from the facts and
circumstances underlying the Companys representations and warranties
contained in _Article II_ hereof, when such representations and warranties
were made or deemed made; or (ii) changes in Law. Under no circumstances shall
Parent be entitled to be indemnified hereunder for any punitive, exemplary,
incidental or consequential damages. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent shall not have any right to
indemnification as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty set
forth in _Section 2.08 _(other than _Sections 2.08(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ ,
_(k)_ , _(l)_ , _(o)_ , and _(p)_ ) from and against any and all Taxes (or
non-payment thereof) occurring in or related to periods after the Closing;
provided, however, that (x) the preceding limitation shall not apply with
respect to any indemnification obligation that arises hereunder without regard
to _Section 2.08_ (e.g., indemnification for Indemnified Taxes), even if such
obligation also arises in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 2.08_ and (y) for these purposes, penalties and
interest attributable to a Tax attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
attributable to a failure to comply with a requirement relating to the
preparation or filing of any Tax Return filed or required to be filed before
the Closing Date shall not be treated as a Tax of any of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries for any taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

7.03 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent will not be entitled to be indemnified for Losses with respect to
the matters described in _Section 7.02_ for any Loss except to the extent the
total of all Losses with respect to such matters, in the aggregate, exceeds
$400,000 (the " _Basket_ "), at which time Parent shall have the right to set-
off only the full amount of such Losses (i.e., and not just the excess over
the Basket) in excess of the Basket against the Milestone Consideration in
compliance with _Section 7.06_ in the order such Milestone Consideration
becomes due, until the full amount of Parents indemnifiable Losses shall have
been so set-off against the Milestone Consideration in compliance with
_Section 7.06_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Appraisal Rights Payments
shall not be subject to or counted towards such Basket and may be set-off
against the Milestone Consideration in compliance with _Section 7.06_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum amount of Losses
that may be set-off against and reduce the Milestone Consideration pursuant to
this _Article VII_ is limited to $5,000,000 (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Losses or other amounts be set-
off against or reduce the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article VII_
(individually or together with all previous amounts that were set-off against
or reduced the Milestone Consideration) by an aggregate amount in excess of
the Indemnity Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Basket nor the
Indemnity Cap shall apply to any Losses resulting from (1) fraud, (2) any
breach of the Fundamental Representations, (3) the adjustments set forth in
_Section 1.13_ with respect to Closing Cash and Estimated Closing Cash, (4)
Indemnified Taxes or (5) Consideration Spreadsheet Losses.

 



 

(b) In addition to the foregoing limits, except in the case of fraud, Parent
acknowledges that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent with respect to claims for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be to set-off the amount of such Losses (subject to the
Indemnity Cap, if applicable) against the Milestone Consideration not yet paid
to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders (but not against
Milestone Consideration for which payment to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the applicable Stockholders is past due), in the order in
which such Milestone Consideration becomes due, all in compliance with
_Section 7.06_. Except in the case of fraud, no amount previously paid or
delivered by the Parent or Surviving Company hereunder shall be subject to
recovery by Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, Surviving Company, any
Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or Merger Sub II or Surviving Company, or
any Person claiming by or through Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, Surviving
Company or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or Merger Sub II or Surviving
Company.

 



 

(c) Parent shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
Losses subject to indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall be
calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds actually received
by Parent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses, less costs
incurred to obtain such insurance proceeds, (ii) any recoveries which are
obtained by Parent (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party, less
costs to obtain such recoveries, or (iii) any Tax refunds or actual reductions
in Taxes realized by Parent in the tax year in which the Loss was incurred or
in the immediately succeeding tax year as a result of incurring such Loss.

 



 

(d) The right of Parent to recover for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this
Article VII shall not be affected by any investigation conducted or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Company herein.

 



 

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Article VII_, but not for determining whether a
breach of any representation or warranty has occurred, the

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties of the Parties in this Agreement shall not be
deemed to be qualified by any references to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

7.04 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) All claims for indemnification by Parent under this _Article VII_ shall
be brought in good faith and asserted and resolved in accordance with this
_Section 7.04_ and be subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this
_Article VII_.

 



 

(b) If Parent intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_,
Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders Representative in writing of
such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the amount or
estimated amount of such Losses (the " _Claims Notice_ "); provided that,
subject to the limitations in respect of the Survival Date, the failure of
Parent to promptly notify the Stockholders Representative shall not relieve
the Company Indemnifying Parties from liability for such claims except and
only to the extent that the Company Indemnifying Parties were actually
prejudiced by such delay. In the event that Parent delivers a Claim Notice,
Parent shall promptly provide, and shall cause Surviving Company to promptly
provide, the Stockholders Representative with (x) all books, records and other
materials and information reasonably requested by the Stockholders
Representative related to the claims set forth in the Claims Notice, and (y)
the right to speak to, ask questions of and receive responsive answers from
key personnel of Parent and Surviving Company having responsibility for or
knowledge of the matters set forth in the Claims Notice.

 



 

(c) For a period of thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of a Claims Notice
(the " _Dispute Period_ ") in compliance with _Section 7.04(a)_, Parent shall
make no reduction to the Milestone Consideration with respect to the Losses
alleged in such Claims Notice unless Parent shall have received written
authorization from the Stockholders Representative to make such reduction.
After the expiration of the Dispute Period, Parent shall reduce the Milestone
Consideration by an amount equal to all or a portion of the Losses set forth
in such Claims Notice only to the extent the Stockholders Representative has
not objected in a written statement to the applicable portion of any claim or
claims made in the Claims Notice, which written statement shall include in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and such written statement
shall have been delivered to Parent prior to the expiration of the Dispute
Period. Parent shall not set-off against or reduce the Milestone Consideration
by the amount of any claimed Losses that are timely objected to by the
Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(d) If the Stockholders Representative objects in writing to any portion of
the claim or claims by Parent made in any Claims Notice within the Dispute
Period, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate in good
faith for forty-five (45) days after Parents receipt of such written
objection (the " _Negotiation Period_ ") to resolve such objection. If Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. Parent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and Parent shall reduce
the Milestone Consideration in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.

 



 

(e) If no such agreement can be reached during the Negotiation Period, but in
any event upon the expiration of the Negotiation Period, either Parent or the
Stockholders Representative may bring suit in a court having competent
jurisdiction. The final non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claims Notice
shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the court may be entered in any other court having
jurisdiction over the applicable Party.

 



       
 

 



 

7.05 _Third Party Claims_

 



 

(a) If any claim, action, suit or proceeding is made against Parent or the
Surviving Company by a third party that will or could be the subject of a
Claims Notice (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), Parent shall give prompt written
notice of such Third Party Claim to the Stockholders Representative. The
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at the sole expense of the Stockholders,
separate from the counsel employed by Parent.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor Company shall consent to entry of a judgment, admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, a Third Party
Claim without the Stockholders Representatives prior written consent, not to
be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 7.05(b)_, Parent and the Company shall prosecute,
defend and settle any Third Party Claim. Parent and the Company shall pursue,
through counsel of their selection, the prosecution, defense or settlement of
all Third Party Claims until such time, if any, that Parent shall elect not to
pursue indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim. Parent agrees
to, and to cause the Company to, act reasonably and in good faith in
connection with the prosecution, defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim. The Company Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any Losses
of Parent and the Company as a result of such Third Party Claims to the extent
subject to indemnification under this _Article VII_, and Parent and the
Company shall retain all remedies to which they are entitled under this
_Article VII_. Parent shall keep the Stockholders Representative reasonably
informed of all material developments with respect thereto and shall allow the
Stockholders Representative to participate in the prosecution, defense and
settlement of such Third-Party Claim at the expense of the Stockholders.

 



 

7.06 _Set-off Right_. Subject to and after compliance with _Sections 7.03_ ,
_7.04_ and _7.05_ herein, Parent shall have the right to set-off the amount of
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article VII (subject to the Indemnity
Cap, if applicable) against the Milestone Consideration not yet paid to the
Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders (but not against
Milestone Consideration for which payment to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Stockholders is past due), in the order in which such
Milestone Consideration becomes due, in order to provide recourse to Parent
with respect to Parents rights under this Agreement, including Parents
indemnification rights under this _Article VII_.

 



 

7.07 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, this _Article
VII_ will provide Parents and Surviving Companys sole and exclusive recourse
and remedy for disputes, claims and Losses relating to or arising, directly or
indirectly, from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than for fraud. This _Article VII_ will not affect any remedy Parent
may have under this Agreement prior to the Closing or upon termination of this
Agreement prior to a Closing.

 



 

7.08 _Tax Treatment_. Any payment under this _Article VII_ shall be treated
by the parties for U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes
as a purchase price adjustment unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

TAX MATTERS

 



 

8.01 _Straddle Period_

 



 

In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any income Taxes for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time). Any Property Taxes for any Straddle Period
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date on a per diem basis, and all other Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be
allocated as if such Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date, except that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions), other than with respect
to property placed in service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per
diem basis.

 



 

8.02 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_

 



 

(a) Parent, Surviving Company, Subsidiaries, the Stockholders Representative,
and the Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this ARTICLE XIII and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Surviving Company, Stockholders Representative, the Subsidiaries and
Stockholders agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Stockholders
Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, Parent or Stockholders Representative, as the case
may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Stockholders Representative further agree, upon request, to
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 



 

8.03 _Transfer Taxes_

 



 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by Stockholders.

 



 

8.04 _Certain Tax Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the Companys and its
Subsidiaries past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Parent shall provide a copy of each such Tax Return relating to a period (or
portion thereof) before the Closing Date to the Stockholders Representative as
soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event at least twenty-five (25)
calendar days) before the deadline for filing each such Tax Return and shall
make all changes to such

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative if
received by Parent at least five days prior to the deadline for filing each
such Tax Return within such twenty day period.

 



 

(b) Following the Mergers, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company will (and
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company will allow any of its Affiliates to)
(i) amend or modify a Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) take any action that would extend the
applicable statute of limitations for any Taxes or Tax Return of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) file, amend
or revoke any Tax election of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) make a voluntary disclosure to a Governmental
Entity with respect to any Tax or Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (v) file an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of Company Stock
pursuant to the Mergers, in each case, without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders Representative (such consent not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), if any such action would result in any obligation of
the Company Indemnifying Parties to indemnify Parent under this Agreement.
None of Parent, Company, Merger Sub II (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Surviving Company) will, and none of Parent, Company, Merger Sub II
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Company) will allow any
of its Affiliates to, take any action on the Closing Date after the First
Effective Time, other than an action in the ordinary course of business or
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, which would result in any Tax
liability to the Stockholders or any indemnity for Taxes under this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

TERMINATION

 



 

9.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in Article II shall not be true and correct, or if the Company has
failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing),
such that the conditions to Closing set forth in either _Section 6.01(a)_ or
_Section 6.01(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the
breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be true
and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not cured within fifteen (15) Business Days after written
notice thereof is delivered to the Company; _provided, however_ , that Parent
and/or Merger Sub is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the
condition to Closing set forth in either _Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section
6.02(b)_ to not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(c) by the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in Article III shall not be true and correct, or if
Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing), such that the conditions
to Closing set forth in either _Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section 6.02(b)_ would
not be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the breach or breaches causing
such representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures
to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within
fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice thereof is delivered to Parent
or Merger Sub; _provided, however_ , that the Company is not then in breach of
this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement so as to cause the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
6.01(a)_ or _Section 6.01(b)_ from being satisfied as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(d) by Parent or the Company, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to the date that is six
(6) months from the Effective Date (such date, the " _Outside Date_ ") and the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_
shall not have ( _provided, however_ , that if such Party is Parent, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have) breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the
principal cause of the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before the Outside Date;

 



 

(e) by Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered, or threatens to enact, issue,
promulgate, enforce or enter any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction, order or other legal restraint which is in effect and
which has the effect of making the Mergers illegal;

 



 

(f) by Company, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholder
Consent, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
_Section 4.03(e)_; or

 



 

(g) by Parent, if Estimated Closing Cash is less than negative six million
dollars (-$6,000,000).

 



 

9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company as provided above, the provisions of this
Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect
(other than this _Section 9.02_, _Section 10.01(d)_, _Section 10.01(e)_ and
_Article XII_ hereof which shall survive the termination of this Agreement),
and there shall be no liability on the part of either Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II, the Company, the Stockholders Representative or the
Stockholders to one another, except for willful breaches of this Agreement
prior to the time of such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Company terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_, then, no
later than the next Business Day following the date of such termination, the
Company shall pay to Parent, as Parents sole and exclusive remedy, the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent, pursuant to _Section 4.03_. Each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.02 _are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II would not have entered into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ do
not constitute a penalty.

any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



      
 

 



 

12.15 _Jurisdiction_. Any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined
exclusively by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; _provided,
however_ , that if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not
have jurisdiction, any such Action shall be brought exclusively in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware or any other court of the
State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action in any such court or that any such Action which is brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Action may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in
_Section 12.03_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

 



 

12.16 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

12.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching
Party may have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that
prior to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
Agreement, such non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an
Action or Actions for damages but also by an Action or Actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security). Each of the Parties hereby waives any requirement under
Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

12.18 _Conflict Waiver; Attorney-Client Privilege_. Notwithstanding that the
Company has been represented by Holland and Knight LLP (the " _Firm_ ") in the
preparation, negotiation and execution of the this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company agrees that after the Closing
the Firm may represent the Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders
and/or their affiliates in matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation in respect of
any indemnification claims pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and
its affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained
information relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the
reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it
hereby waives any conflict arising out of such future representation. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree that they do not intend for the
attorney-client privilege between the Firm and the Company to continue with
the Company following the Closing. Accordingly, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II or the Surviving Company shall have any rights with
respect to the attorney-client privilege that existed between the Firm and the
Company prior to the Closing and each of the Parent, the Company, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II or the Surviving Company agree not to waive or seek to waive
such privilege or otherwise obtain, or seek to obtain, any information subject
to attorney-client privilege with respect to any time period prior to the
First Effective Time.

1 and Merger Sub 2 have required that Stockholder enter into this Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to enter
into the Merger Agreement, Stockholder is willing to enter into this
Agreement.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent
and Stockholder hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. **_Voting Agreement_** _._ Stockholder agrees that at any meeting (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of Company Stock, however called (each, a " **Company Stockholders Meeting** "), or in connection with any written consent of the holders of Company Stock, such Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) or deliver a written consent (or cause a written consent to be delivered) with respect to (x) all such Stockholders Company Stock, in the event that no Recommendation Withdrawal has been made at that time, or (y) the Recommendation Withdrawal Percentage of all such Stockholders Company Stock, in the event that the Companys Board of Directors has made a Recommendation Withdrawal, in each case, to the fullest extent that such Company Stock are entitled to be voted at the time of any vote or action by written consent:

 



 

(a) in favor of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) without
limitation of the preceding clause (i), the approval of any proposal to
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a later date if there
are not sufficient votes for adoption of the Merger Agreement on the date on
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is held; and

 



 

(b) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially impede, hinder, interfere with, prevent, delay or adversely affect
the consummation of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

 **CONFIDENTIAL**

 



 

contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, any
agreement or arrangement related to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

As used herein, " **Recommendation Withdrawal Percentage** " means, with
respect to a Stockholder, [ ]% of the Company Stock held by such
Stockholder.

 



 

Subject to the proxy granted under Section 2 below, Stockholder shall retain
at all times the right to vote the Company Stock in such Stockholders sole
discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other than those
set forth in Sections 1(a) and 1(b) that are at any time or from time to time
presented for consideration to the Companys stockholders generally.

 



 

2. **_Irrevocable Proxy_** _._ In the event and to the extent that the Stockholder fails to vote such Stockholders Company Stock in accordance with Section 1 at any applicable meeting of the stockholders of the Company or pursuant to any applicable written consent of the stockholders of the Company, then such Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as attorney-in-fact and proxy for and on behalf of such Stockholder, for and in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to:

 



 

(a) attend any and all Company Stockholder Meetings;

 



 

(b) vote, express consent or dissent or issue instructions to the record
holder to vote such Stockholders Company Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1 at any such meeting; and

 



 

(c) grant or withhold, or issue instructions to the record holder to grant or
withhold, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1, all written consents
with respect to the Company Stock.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Recommendation Withdrawal,
such Stockholder shall only be deemed to have granted proxies to the extent of
such Stockholders Recommendation Withdrawal Percentage of such Stockholders
Company Stock. The foregoing proxy shall be deemed to be a proxy coupled with
an interest, is irrevocable (and as such shall survive and not be affected by
the death, incapacity, mental illness or insanity of such Stockholder) and
shall not be terminated by operation of any legal requirement or upon the
occurrence of any other event other than the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4(j). The foregoing proxy shall terminate upon termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4(j). Each Stockholder authorizes such
attorney and proxy to substitute any other Person to act hereunder, to revoke
any substitution and to file this proxy and any substitution or revocation
with the Secretary of the Company. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the
irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 2 is given in connection with and
granted in consideration of and as an inducement to Parent entering into the
Merger Agreement and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the
obligations of the Stockholder under Section 1 hereof. Parent covenants and
agrees with each Stockholder that Parent will exercise the foregoing proxy
consistent with the provisions of Section 1 hereof.

 



 

3. **_Stockholder Representations_**. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 as follows:

 



 

(a) Stockholder, if Stockholder is an entity, has all requisite power and
authority or, if Stockholder is an individual, has the legal capacity, to
enter into this Agreement and to perform Stockholders covenants and
obligations under this Agreement. If Stockholder is an entity, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by Stockholder of
Stockholders covenants and obligations under this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Stockholder and no further
action is required on the part of Stockholder to authorize this Agreement or

 



      
 

 



 

the performance by Stockholder of its covenants and obligations hereunder.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Stockholder,
enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to laws
of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, the
relief of debtors and enforcement of creditors rights in general and rules of
law governing specific performance, injunctive relief, other equitable
remedies and other general principles of equity.

 



 

(b) Stockholder is the sole record or beneficial owner of the Company Stock
designated as being owned by Stockholder underneath Stockholders name on the
signature page to this Agreement, with the sole right to exercise voting
rights with respect to such Company Stock. Such Company Stock owned by
Stockholder is not subject to any Liens or to any rights of first refusal of
any kind, and Stockholder has not granted any rights to purchase such Company
Stock to any other Person. Such Company Stock constitutes all of the equity
securities of the Company owned, beneficially or of record, by Stockholder.

 



 

(c) There is no Action of any nature pending or, to the knowledge of such
Stockholder, threatened against Stockholder, whether by or before a
Governmental Entity or by or before any other party, arising out of or
relating to (i) Stockholders beneficial ownership of Company Stock, or (ii)
Stockholders capacity as a holder of Company Stock. There is no Action of any
nature pending or, to the knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against
Stockholder, whether by or before a Governmental Entity or by or before any
other party, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
or impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform such Stockholders
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(d) The execution and delivery by Stockholder of this Agreement and the
performance by Stockholder of Stockholders covenants and obligations
hereunder and thereunder will not, conflict with (i) any provision of the
charter documents of Stockholder if Stockholder is an entity, (ii) any
contract to which Stockholder or any of Stockholders properties or assets is
subject or (iii) any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Stockholder or Stockholders properties or assets.

 



 

(e) Stockholder has received a copy of the Merger Agreement and has carefully
read and understands the scope and effect of the provisions of this Agreement
and the Merger Agreement and has discussed the foregoing with Stockholders
professional advisors to the extent Stockholder has deemed necessary.

 



 

4. **_Miscellaneous_**.

 



 

(a) **_Notices_**. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be made and given in

 ** _INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDERING CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

( _Please read carefully the instructions below_ )

 



 

1. **_Method of Delivery_** : Unless you have delivered this Letter of Transmittal to the Company prior to the closing of the Mergers for delivery to the Exchange Agent, your certificate(s) for shares of Company Stock and the Letter of Transmittal must be sent or delivered to Compushare Inc. (the "Exchange Agent"). Do not otherwise send your certificates to Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The method of delivery of certificates to be surrendered to the Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the front of this Letter of Transmittal is at the option and risk of the surrendering stockholder. Delivery will be deemed effective, and risk of loss and title to the certificate(s) shall pass, only when received by the Exchange Agent. If you submit this Letter of Transmittal by facsimile, you must also send or deliver your certificate(s) in order to receive the Merger Consideration. **If the certificate(s) are sent by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested and proper insurance is suggested.**

 



 

2. **_Payment_** ** _in the Same Name_** : If the check/wire and stock certificates for Celldex Common Stock are issued in the same name as the surrendered certificate is registered, the Letter of Transmittal should be completed and signed exactly as the surrendered certificate is registered. __Do not sign the stock certificate(s_ )_. _Signature guarantees are not required_ if the certificate(s) surrendered herewith are submitted by the registered owner of such shares who has not completed the section entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or are for the account of an Eligible Institution. If any of the shares surrendered hereby are owned by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal exactly as written on the face of the certificate(s). If any shares are registered in different names on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations. Letters of Transmittal executed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations, or others acting in a fiduciary capacity who are not identified as such in the registration must be accompanied by proper evidence of the signers authority to act.

 



 

3. **_Payment in Different Name_** _:_ If the section entitled "Special Payment Instructions" is completed, then signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is an Eligible Institution. If the surrendered certificates are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made to a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or if the payment is to be made to a person other than the registered owner(s), then the surrendered certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered owners appear on such certificate(s) or stock power(s), with the signatures on the certificate(s) or stock power(s) guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided herein.

 



 

4. **_Special Payment and Delivery Instructions_** : Indicate the name in which and address to which the check and stock certificates for Celldex Common Stock are to be sent if different from the name and/or address of the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal. If Special Payment Instructions have been completed, a Form W-9 (or appropriate Form W-8) must also be completed for the person named therein, and that person will be considered the record owner.

 



 

5. **_Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Certificate(s); Lost Certificate(s_** _)_ : You will not receive your check for Milestone Consideration, if any and stock certificate unless and until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, to the Exchange Agent, together with the certificate(s) evidencing your shares of Company Stock and any required accompanying evidences of authority. ** If your certificate(s) has been lost, stolen, misplaced or destroyed, please complete and submit a Certificate of Loss and Indemnity, the form of which is attached hereto as Annex I, to the Exchange Agent at **[*] **or** [*] **. **Any Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stockholder who has lost certificates must submit a Certificate of Loss and Indemnity.

 



 

6. **_Tax Forms_** : Under the federal income tax law, a non-exempt stockholder is required to provide the Exchange Agent with such stockholders correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on the enclosed Form W-9 if such non-exempt stockholder is a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person. If the certificate(s) are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the General Instructions to Form W-9 for additional guidance on which number to report. _Failure to provide the information on the form (including a TIN) may subject the surrendering stockholder to 28% backup withholding on any payment whether in cash or shares._ The surrendering stockholder must write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN if a TIN has not been issued but the stockholder has applied for a number. If a TIN has been applied for and the Exchange Agent is not provided with a TIN before payment is made, the Exchange Agent may be required to withhold 28% on all payments to such surrendering stockholders of any consideration due for their former shares. Non-U.S. persons should provide a properly completed appropriate Form W-8 (rather than a Form W-9) to the Exchange Agent in order to establish their exemption from backup withholder. Forms W-8 are available from the Internal Revenue Service website, www.irs.gov.

 



 

7. **_Stock Transfer Taxes_** _:_ If payment is to be made to any person other than the registered holder, or if surrendered certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing the Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or such person) payable as a result of the transfer to such person will be deducted from the payment for such securities if satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted. Except as provided in this Instruction 7, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificates listed in the Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

8. **_Milestone Consideration_** : Please be advised that any Milestone Consideration payable in cash will be delivered via check to the address of record on file with the Exchange Agent. If you would like to request that any Milestone Consideration be delivered via a different payment method (e.g. wire), you must provide the Stockholders Representative revised payment instructions (including any updates or corrections to the information previously provided in your completed Letter of Transmittal) not less than five Business Days following receipt of a Milestone Notice (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) from the Stockholders Representative.

      
 

 



 

All questions as to the validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
certificates will be determined by the Exchange Agent and Kolltan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and such determination shall be final and binding.
Exchange Agent and the Company reserve the right to waive any irregularities
or defects in the surrender of any certificates. A surrender will not be
deemed to have been made until all irregularities have been cured or waived.

 



 

 **The Form W-9 BELOW must be completed and signed if you are a U.S. person
(including a U.S. resident alien)**. PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER OR OTHER TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ("TIN") AND CERTIFY THAT YOU
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING.

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
stockholder who tenders Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stock certificates that
are accepted for exchange may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a
28% rate). If the stockholder is a U.S. person, in order to avoid such backup
withholding, the stockholder must provide the Exchange Agent with such
stockholders correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") and provide
certain certifications, including a certification as to the correctness of the
TIN and that such stockholder is not subject to such backup withholding, by
completing the Form W-9 provided herewith. In general, if a stockholder is an
individual, the TIN is the Social Security number or individual taxpayer
identification number of such individual, and, in the case of an entity, is
the stockholders Employer Identification Number. If the stockholder does not
have a TIN, such stockholder should obtain Form SS-4 or W-7, as applicable,
apply for a TIN on such applicable Form, and receive a TIN prior to submitting
the Form W-9. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct taxpayer
identification number, the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed
by the Internal Revenue Service, in addition to backup withholding. For
further information concerning backup withholding and instructions for
completing the Form W-9 (including how to obtain a taxpayer identification
number if you do not have one and how to complete the W-9 if the Kolltan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stock certificates are held in more than one name),
consult the General Instructions to the Form W-9 and/or your tax advisor.

 



 

Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations) are not
subject to these backup withholding and reporting requirements. To prevent
possible erroneous backup withholding, an exempt stockholder should provide
its exempt payee code on the Form W-9. A stockholder that is not a U.S. person
must submit an appropriate and properly completed Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,
W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY (and all required attachments), as the case may be,
signed under penalties of perjury attesting to such non-U.S. status. Such
forms and instructions may be obtained from the IRS at: www.irs.gov.

 



 

Failure to complete the Form W-9 or appropriate Form W-8 will not, by itself,
cause the Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stock certificates to be deemed
invalidly tendered, but may require the Exchange Agent to withhold a portion
of the amount of any payments made pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding
is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal income tax
liability of a person subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a
refund may be obtained provided that the required information is furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.

 



 

 **Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
applicability and refund of backup withholding tax and to determine which form
should be used to avoid backup withholding.**

 



 

NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE FORM W-9 (OR APPROPRIATE FORM W-8)
MAY RESULT IN BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF A PORTION OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU
PURSUANT TO THE MERGER.

 **Form of Lock-Up Agreement**

 



 

 **LOCK-UP AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Lock-Up Agreement, dated , 2016 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and

_Merger Sub 1_ "), Connemara Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Celldex, Kolltan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, as the Stockholders Representative (the "
_Stockholders  Representative_"), pursuant to which Celldex is acquiring the
Company by means of a merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the Company with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and then a subsequent
merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 continuing
as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Celldex, pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in the Merger
Agreement (collectively, the " _Mergers_ ," and the date the Mergers are
consummated, the " _Closing Date_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Holder is a stockholder of the Company immediately prior to the
consummation of the Mergers and, as such, will benefit from the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Holder is a
condition to the Holders receipt of the Holders applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged and intending to be legally bound,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Lock-Up_.

 



 

(a) The Holder shall not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, assign, grant
any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, make any short sale, enter

part, any of the economic consequences of ownership, or otherwise dispose of,
directly or indirectly, the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Celldex (" _Celldex Common Stock_ ") set forth on _Schedule A_ (the

continuing through the close of trading on the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date with respect to all of the Locked-Up Shares
(the " _Lock-Up Period_ ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1(a_), during the Lock-Up

and substance reasonably satisfactory to Celldex, to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that any such transfer
shall not involve a disposition for value, (iii) to the Holders affiliates
(including, if applicable, commonly controlled or managed investment funds)

offer publicly recommended by Celldexs board of directors, (v) pursuant to a

document or by intestacy. For purposes hereof, " _immediate family_ " shall
mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than
first cousin, and " _affiliate_ " shall mean, as applied to any entity, any
other entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under
direct or indirect common control with, such entity (for purposes hereof, "
_control_ " (including, with correlative meanings, the terms " _controlling_
," " _controlled by_ " and " _under common control with_ "), as applied to any
entity, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise).

 



 

(c) The Holder consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with
Celldexs transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the Locked-Up
Shares except in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this Section 1.

 



 

(d) Each Holder acknowledges that the Locked-Up Shares bear the following
legend evidencing the lock-up restrictions set forth in this _Section 1_
(which legend shall be removed at the end of the applicable Lock-Up Period):

 



 

"THESE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE HOLDER AND THE ISSUER. THESE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED, GIFTED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENT, AND ANY ATTEMPT TO DO SO SHALL BE VOID."

 



 

2. _Representations and Warranties_. The Holder hereby represents and warrants to Celldex as follows:

We thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter. Once
you have completed the Questionnaire, please transmit a copy electronically to
eric.agovino@kolltan.com and mail the original to Kolltan Pharmaceuticals,

 **Investor Questionnaire**

 



 

This Questionnaire is being distributed to you (the " **Investor** ") by
KOLLTAN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company** "),
to determine whether you are qualified to invest in the common stock (the "
**Securities** ") of a publicly traded biotechnology company (" **PubCo** ")
with which the Company is proposing to engage in a merger transaction.

 



 

To be qualified to invest in the Securities, the Investor must either (i) be
an "accredited investor" (as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation
D promulgated under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " **Securities Act** ")), or (ii) have (and if applicable, its officers,
employees, directors or equity owners have) either alone or with his, her or
its purchaser representative or representatives, if any, such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that he, she or it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities.

 



 

The Company will rely upon the accuracy and completeness of the information
provided in this Questionnaire in establishing that the issuance of the
Securities is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

 



 

 **ACCORDINGLY, THE INVESTOR IS OBLIGATED TO READ THIS QUESTIONNAIRE CAREFULLY

such parties as the Company deems appropriate if called upon to establish that
the issuance of the Securities (i) is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act or (ii) meets the requirements of
applicable state securities laws; provided however that the Company need not
give prior notice to the Investor of its presentation of this Questionnaire to
the Companys regularly employed legal, accounting and financial advisors.

 



 

The Investor understands that this Questionnaire is merely a request for
information and is not an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or
a sale of the Securities. The Investor also understands that the Investor may
be required to furnish additional information.
