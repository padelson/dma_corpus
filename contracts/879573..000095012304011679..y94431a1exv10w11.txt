Ordinary Course  of Business) (the "Closing Statement").   (iii) The Seller
may, by notice given to the Buyer within 30  days after delivery of the

Buyer\'s Subscriber Adjustment (the  "Closing Statement Dispute Notice").
Such Closing Statement Dispute  Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
the Seller\'s objections to  the Buyer\'s Working Capital Amount and the
Buyer\'s Subscriber  Adjustment and the Seller\'s reasons therefor and the

Dispute Notice to the Buyer within 30 days after delivery of the  Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement, and the Buyer\'s Working  Capital Amount
and the Buyer\'s Subscriber Adjustment as set forth  therein, shall be final
and binding on the Buyer and the Seller. If the  Seller delivers such a
Closing Statement Dispute Notice, from the date  of delivery of such Closing
Statement Dispute Notice until the 30th day  after the date of delivery of
the Closing Statement, the Buyer and the  Seller shall use their respective
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to  attempt in good faith to resolve the

the date of delivery  of the Closing Statement Dispute Notice, the Buyer and
Buyer\'s  Accountants shall use their respective Commercially Reasonable
Efforts  to cooperate with the Seller and Seller\'s Accountants and provide 
reasonable access to work papers of Buyer\'s Accountants to the extent 
reasonably necessary to the Closing Statement. The Buyer shall provide  to
the Seller and its representatives, including, without limitation,  the
Seller\'s Accountants, access at all reasonable times to the Buyer,  the
Systems and their books and records to the extent reasonably  necessary for
the purposes of preparing the Closing Statement   Dispute Notice and
resolving any disputes relating to the Closing  Statement and the Closing
Statement Dispute Notice.   (iv) If the Seller has timely delivered a
Closing Statement  Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2(f)(iii), and the
Buyer and the  Seller do not reach written agreement as to the Working
Capital or the  Subscriber Adjustment, if any, as applicable, prior to the
30th day  after the date of delivery of the Closing Statement Dispute
Notice,  then either the Seller or the Buyer may by notice to the other
(the  "Resolution Notice") submit to Ernst and Young LLP (the "Unaffiliated 
Firm") for determination, in accordance with this Section 2(f), the  amount
of the Working Capital or the Subscriber Adjustment, as  applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate difference  between the
proposed amounts of Working Capital and the proposed  amounts of Subscriber
Adjustment is less than $100,000, the Working  Capital and the Subscriber
Adjustment shall be the average of the  proposed amounts of the Working
Capital and the Subscriber Adjustment,  respectively, and the Parties will
not instruct the Unaffiliated Firm  to render any decision. The following
shall apply with respect to the  use of the Unaffiliated Firm:   (A) Within
15 days after the delivery of the  Resolution Notice, the Buyer and the
Seller shall each propose an  amount of Working Capital or Subscriber
Adjustment, as  applicable, to the Unaffiliated Firm, together with the
reasons  therefor, in writing. The Working Capital or the Subscriber 
Adjustment, as applicable, proposed by the Buyer shall not differ  from the
Buyer\'s Working Capital Amount or the Buyer\'s Subscriber  Adjustment, as
applicable, other than for changes agreed to in  writing by the Seller, and
the Working Capital or the Subscriber  Adjustment, as applicable, proposed by
the Seller shall not  differ from the Seller\'s proposed amount of Working
Capital or  Subscriber Adjustment, as applicable, set forth in the Closing 
Statement Dispute Notice, other than for those changes agreed to  in writing
by the Buyer. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall  furnish to the
Unaffiliated Firm such workpapers and other  documents and information under
its control or available to it  and its Affiliates as the Unaffiliated Firm
may request for the  purposes of determining the Working Capital or
Subscriber  Adjustment, as applicable.   (B) The amount determined by the
Unaffiliated Firm  (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) shall not
be  higher than the higher of the proposed amount of Working Capital  or
Subscriber Adjustment, as applicable, or lower than the lower  of the
proposed amounts of Working Capital or Subscriber  Adjustment, as applicable,
and shall thereupon be the Working  Capital or Subscriber Adjustment, as
applicable. The Parties will  instruct the Unaffiliated Firm to render its
decision no later  than 30 days after the submission to the Unaffiliated Firm
under  Section 2(f)(iv)(A).   (C) At any time after the determination of
the  Working Capital or Subscriber Adjustment, as applicable, has been 
submitted to the Unaffiliated Firm, the Buyer and the Seller may  agree on
the Working Capital or Subscriber Adjustment, as  applicable, and direct the
Unaffiliated Firm to not render any  decision.  Any determination of the
Working Capital or Subscriber Adjustment, as applicable, in accordance with
Section 2(f)(iv), whether by agreement between the Buyer and the Seller, by
operation of the second sentence of Section 2(f)(iv), or by the Unaffiliated
Firm, shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties. The Working Capital
determined as set forth in the preceding sentence is hereinafter referred to
as the "Final Working Capital Amount," and the Subscriber Adjustment
determined as set forth in the preceding sentence is hereafter referred to as
the "Final Subscriber Adjustment."   (v) Subject to Section 8(g)(v),
promptly, but in any event not  more than five Business Days, after the later
of the determination of  the Final Working Capital Amount and the Final
Subscriber Adjustment,  if any, (A) if the Final Working Capital Amount is
less than the  Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Seller shall pay the
absolute  value of the difference between such amounts to the Buyer, (B) if
the  Final Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Working 
Capital Amount, the Buyer shall pay the difference between such amounts  to
the Seller, (C) if the Final Subscriber Adjustment is less than the 
Estimated Subscriber Adjustment, Buyer shall pay the absolute value of  the
difference between such amounts to the Seller, and (D) if the Final 
Subscriber Adjustment is greater than the Estimated Subscriber  Adjustment,
the Seller shall pay the difference between such amounts to  the Buyer, in
all cases together with simple interest at the rate of 6%  per annum, for the
period from the Closing Date to and through the date  of payment. All
payments made under this Section 2(f)(v) shall be made  by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the  Party entitled to payment
notified to the Party making such payment.   (vi) The fees and expenses of
the Unaffiliated Firm for its  services and expenses under this Section 2(f)
shall be shared and paid  one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the
Seller.   (vii) Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize or permit 
the Unaffiliated Firm to arbitrate or determine any question or matter 
whatever under or in connection with this Agreement except the specific 
items in dispute between the Parties with respect to the amount of the 
Working Capital and the Subscriber Adjustment to be determined in  accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement or require the  Unaffiliated Firm to
follow the rules of the American Arbitration  Association or any other body
in making such determination.   (g) Capital Expenditures. Set forth on
Schedule 2(g) is a true and  correct copy of the amounts the Company has
budgeted for capital  expenditures or capital additions or betterments
("Capital Expenditures")  for its fiscal year June 1, 2004 through May 31,
2005 (such budgeted  Capital Expenditures for such fiscal year, the "Budgeted
Capital  Expenditures") set forth on a fiscal quarterly basis, including a 
breakdown of the amounts thereof by category or purpose of such Capital 
Expenditures. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the  anticipated
Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a  statement setting
forth the Capital Expenditures made by the Company  during the period from
June 1, 2004 through the anticipated Closing Date,  together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation for such  expenditures. For purposes of
calculating the Capital   Expenditure Deficit, if any, the aggregate amount
set forth in Schedule  2(g) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be  the number of days from June 1, 2004 to the Closing Date,
and the  denominator of which shall be 365 (the resulting amount, the "Pro-
Rata  Amount"). If the aggregate amount expended by the Company during the 
period from June 1, 2004 through the anticipated Closing Date, as set  forth
on Seller\'s statement, is less than the Pro-Rata Amount, such  difference
shall be the "Capital Expenditure Deficit." If, in the good  faith judgment
of the Seller, after consultation with the Buyer, the  Seller determines to
change or modify the purpose or category of any  Capital Expenditure from the
proposed category or purpose set forth on  Schedule 2(g), the Seller may so
change or modify the category or purpose  of such Capital Expenditure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained herein, a Capital
Expenditure Deficit shall be reduced by the  amount of liabilities, if any,
for Capital Expenditures included in the  calculation of Working Capital.  
(h) Settlement of Intercompany Amounts. From and after the date of  this
Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller agrees to cause all  intercompany
receivables and intercompany payables of the Company, in each  case as

manner:   (A) During the period prior to the Closing, the Company  shall be
permitted to net intercompany receivables and payables against  each other;
provided that such receivables and payables constitute  Current Assets and
Current Liabilities, respectively.   (B) At Closing, Seller may, at its
option, cause the  Company to cancel all intercompany receivables of the
Company from its  Affiliates without payment of any cash to the Company. With
respect to  intercompany payables of the Company outstanding at the Closing,
Seller  shall settle such amounts at Closing in cash.  3. Representations

complaint or proceeding or, to the Seller\'s Knowledge, investigation 
pending before the FCC or, to the Knowledge of the Seller or the 
Company,   threatened, concerning the operation of the Systems or relating

its operations pursuant to any pole  attachment Contract have been improperly
conducted or maintained.   (xiv) To the Seller\'s Knowledge, no fact or
circumstance  exists relating to the qualifications of the Company that (A)

property in connection with the  operation of the Systems. To the Knowledge
of the Seller, no Person is  infringing, violating, misusing or
misappropriating any material  intellectual property of the Company, and no

permit the Company to enter into any transaction or to enter into,  modify or
renew any Contract which by reason of its   size, nature or otherwise is not

restrains, restricts, limits or impedes the ability of the Company to 
compete with or conduct any business or line of business in any geographic 
area; (xviii) voluntarily terminate, amend, restate, supplement or waive  any
rights under any Material Contract, License or Franchise, other than  in the

economic change to such Material Contract, License or  Franchise; (xix) with
respect to any oral Contract, enter into a written  Contract to replace such

(xx) agree to do anything prohibited by  this Section 5(c) or anything which
would make any of the representations  and warranties of the Seller in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents  untrue or incorrect in any material
respect.   (d) Full Access. The Seller will permit, and the Seller will 
cause the Company to permit, the Buyer and its representatives to  have full
access, at all reasonable times and upon reasonable  notice, and in a manner
so as not to interfere with the normal  business operations of the Seller and
the Company, to all premises,  properties, personnel, books, records
(including tax records),  Contracts, and documents of, or pertaining to, the
Company;  provided, that all such access shall be, at the option of the 
Seller, with a representative of the Seller present. The Buyer will  treat
and hold as such any Confidential Information it receives from  the Seller or
the Company in the course of the reviews contemplated  by this Section 5(d)
or otherwise, will not use any of the  Confidential Information except in
connection with the consummation  of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will comply in  all respects with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement entered  into prior to the date hereof between the Buyer or one of
its  Affiliates and Centennial in connection with the transactions 
contemplated hereby (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and, if this 
Agreement is terminated for any reason, will return to the Seller or  the
Company, as applicable, or destroy all tangible embodiments (and  all copies)
of the Confidential Information which are in its  possession and otherwise
continue to comply with the terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement. No
investigation by Buyer prior to or  after the date of this Agreement shall
diminish or obviate any of  the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the  Seller contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Documents to  which Seller is a party.   (e) Notice of Developments. Each
Party will, as soon as practicable,  advise the other of any fact or
occurrence or any pending or threatened  occurrence of which any such Party
obtains Knowledge and which if existing  and known at the date of this
Agreement would have been required to be set  forth or disclosed in or
pursuant to this Agreement, which (if existing and  known at any time prior
to or at the Closing) would make the performance by  any Party of a covenant
contained in this Agreement impossible, or which (if  existing and known at
the time of the Closing) would cause a condition to  any Party\'s obligations
under this Agreement not to be fully satisfied. The  Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable  if the Buyer obtains
Knowledge of any facts which would make the  representation and warranty of
the Buyer contained in Section 4(f)  inaccurate.   (f) Exclusivity. The
Seller shall (and shall cause the Company and its  directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents to) immediately  cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations  with any Persons (other
than Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective  agents and
representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any  Acquisition
Transaction. The Seller will not, and will not permit the  Company or any of
its directors, officers, employees, representatives or  agents, to directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, facilitate, or  knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public  information) any
inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any  Acquisition
Transaction or negotiate or otherwise facilitate, encourage,  solicit,
initiate or engage in discussions, negotiations or submissions of  proposals
or offers with any Person with respect to any Acquisition  Transaction, enter
into any written agreement, arrangement, or understanding  requiring it to
abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise cooperate in any way with or  assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by  any other
Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. The Seller shall  immediately
advise the Buyer in writing of the receipt of any written  inquiries or
proposals or requests for non-public information related to an  Acquisition
Transaction and shall disclose to the Buyer the material terms  of any such
proposal or offer.   (g) Liens; Intercompany Debt. The Seller shall take all
necessary  actions, to cause the termination and release on or prior to the
Closing  Date of the Security Interests referred to in Sections 3(i)(i) and
3(i)(iv)  of the Disclosure Schedule as to be so released. At or prior to
Closing, the  Seller shall take all such actions reasonably necessary such
that the  Company shall have no obligation with respect to any accounts
payable of the  Company to the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller or
guarantees or  sureties made by the Company in favor of the Seller or any
Affiliate of the  Seller, nor any rights with respect to any accounts
receivable of the  Company from the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller.
Except as set forth  on Schedule 5(g), all agreements and arrangements
between and among any of  the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other  than the Company), on the other hand, shall be
terminated in their entirety  effective as of the Closing by the parties and
shall be deemed voided,  cancelled and discharged in their entirety and
Seller shall provide the  Buyer copies of an agreement pursuant to which such
agreements and  arrangements shall have been terminated effective as of or
prior to the  Closing evidence of such terminations to Buyer at Closing.  
(h) Excluded Assets, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained
herein, the Buyer agrees that the Company may assign each of the  Excluded
Assets to the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, any of their  respective
designees or any other Person prior to the Closing; provided that  such
assignments, either individually or in the aggregate, do not result in  any
adverse Tax consequences to the Company unless Buyer has consented in 
writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the 
Company shall assign each of the actions, suits, proceedings and litigation 
identified on Schedule 5(h) and all of the Company\'s rights, obligations
and  liabilities relating thereto to the Seller or an Affiliate of the
Seller  prior to the Closing (and the Seller shall, or shall cause such
Affiliate  to, assume such obligations and liabilities) and, after the
Closing, the  Company shall cooperate with the Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective  insurers in all commercially reasonable respects with
respect to the  prosecution, defense and settlement of such actions, suits,
proceedings and  litigation, including, without limitation, by making files,
records,  documents and personnel of the Company available to the Seller,
such  Affiliates and such insurers and their respective counsel.   (i)
Financing. Buyer shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to  obtain and
effectuate the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment  and Equity
Commitment on substantially the terms set forth therein,  including, without
limitation, with respect to the Financing Commitment,  accepting changes to
the pricing, fees, expenses, interest rate or other  terms thereof solely on
the terms provided therein and, in all cases,  subject to the limitations
thereon set forth therein, and to keep the  Financing Commitment and the
Equity Commitment effective in accordance with  their respective terms. Buyer
shall not amend, or agree to amend, the  Financing Commitment in any material
respect that would adversely affect the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without the  consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed. Buyer agrees to notify Seller
promptly if, at any time prior to the  Closing Date the Financing Commitment
or the Equity Commitment shall expire  or be terminated for any reason. Buyer
shall notify Seller as promptly as  practicable of material developments
relating to the Financing and the  Equity Contribution and shall provide
Buyer with copies of the initial  drafts of the definitive documentation for
the Financing, and, upon request  by Seller, Buyer shall provide Seller with
information as to the status of  the Financing and the Equity Contribution.
Buyer will use its Commercially  Reasonable Efforts to provide any other
drafts or executed copies of  definitive documentation to the extent
reasonably requested by Seller;  provided that, in Buyer\'s reasonable
opinion, the provision of such drafts  does not interfere with Buyer\'s
negotiation and timely implementation of the  Financing. If the Financing
Commitment is terminated for any reason prior to  the Closing Date, Buyer
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain,  and, if so obtained,
will provide Seller with a copy of, a new financing  commitment that provides
for at least the same amount of bank financing as  the Financing Commitment
as originally issued, funding conditions not less  favorable to Buyer than
those included in the Financing Commitment as  originally issued and other
terms and conditions the aggregate effect of  which is not materially less
favorable to Buyer in comparison to those  contained in the Financing
Commitment as originally issued, and the  representations contained in the
last two sentences of Section 4(d) and the  provisions of this Section 5(i)
shall apply with respect thereto.   (j) Environmental Access. The Seller
shall cause the Company to permit  the Buyer and Buyer\'s environmental
consultant, to conduct such  investigations (including investigations known
as "Phase I" and "Phase II"  environmental Site Assessments, except that a
Phase II environmental site  assessment shall not be conducted without the
Seller\'s consent which shall  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of
the environmental conditions of  any real property owned, operated or leased
by or for the Company and the  operations conducted thereat (subject to any
limitations contained in any  agreements governing the Company\'s occupancy
and use of any Real Property  which is not Owned Real Property) as Buyer, in
its sole discretion, shall  deem necessary or prudent, such investigations to
be conducted during normal  business hours and not to unreasonably interfere
with the Company\'s business  ("Buyer\'s Environmental Assessments").
Buyer\'s Environmental Assessment  shall be conducted by a qualified
environmental consulting firm, possessing  reasonable levels of insurance
(evidence of which shall be provided to  Seller upon request), in compliance
with applicable Laws, at the expense of  Buyer, and Buyer shall provide
Seller with a copy of all preliminary and  final Buyer\'s Environmental
Assessments.   (k) Financial Information. Within 15 days following the end
of each  calendar month following the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller  shall deliver to the Buyer (i) a true and correct copy of the
unaudited  balance sheet and statement of income of the Company as of, and
for the  calendar month then ended, prepared consistently with the
Accounting  Principles (provided that such balance sheet and statement of
income shall  be subject to normal year-end adjustments and shall not contain
footnotes  and the line item "System Cash Flow" included therein, if any,
shall not  have been prepared in accordance with GAAP); and (ii) a schedule
of the  amount and purpose of the cash capital expenditures made by the
Company  during such calendar month, as well as subscriber counts and such
other  monthly reports of operating statistics regarding the Systems as the
Company  prepares for management in the Ordinary Course of Business.   6.
Post-Closing Covenants.   Following the Closing:   (a) General. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  each Party will take such
further action (including the execution and  delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as the other Party  reasonably may request to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, all at  the sole cost and expense
of the requesting Party (unless the requesting  Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 8).   (b) Access to Books and
Records. For a period of seven years after the  Closing Date, each Party
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, permit the  other Party and its
Affiliates, during reasonable business hours and upon  reasonable notice, to
review any books, records, or other documents of the  Company for any
reasonable and necessary purpose reasonably related to the  interest of such
requesting Party and its Affiliates in the Company, and  shall permit the
requesting Party and its Affiliates, at their cost and  expense, to make
copies of specific portions of any such books, records, or  other materials
relevant to the purpose for which such review is conducted;  provided, that
all such access shall be, at   the option of the providing Party, with
representatives of the providing  Party present. If either Party or the
Company chooses to dispose of any such  books, records, or other materials
during such seven year period, the  disposing Party shall notify the other
Party sufficiently in advance so that  the other Party may review and copy
any such records to be disposed of.   (c) Employees and Employee
Benefits.   (i) Effective as of and following the Closing for the lesser of
(A)  a period of 12 months and (B) the Company\'s next scheduled salary
review  in the Ordinary Course of Business following the Closing Date, each 
Company Employee shall continue, for so long as such Company Employee may  be
employed by the Company in the sole and absolute discretion of the  Company
following the Closing, to receive a base salary or hourly wage no  less than
that in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and after  such period,
questions of salary and hourly wage shall be determined by  Buyer in its sole
discretion. During the 12 month period following the  Closing Date, such
Company Employee shall receive benefits under employee  benefit plans
(excluding equity plans and other incentive compensation)  that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided  under the
Company Plans set forth on Section 3(s) of the Disclosure  Schedule to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. The  Buyer agrees that if
the Company terminates any of the Company Employees,  at any time after
Closing, it will be liable for severance benefits for  such employee in
accordance with its severance policy at such time and  applicable Law,
including, without limitation, liability for any severance  payments under
Law 80 applicable to Company Employees. In providing  benefits to the Company
Employees, for purposes of vesting, eligibility  for participation and
seniority, but not for purposes of benefit accrual  under any defined benefit
retirement plan or retiree medical plan, the  Buyer shall cause each Company
Employee to receive past service credit for  such employee\'s service with
(i) the Seller, (ii) any Affiliate of the  Seller, and (iii) any predecessor
employer, to the extent that service  with the predecessor is credited under
any comparable Company Plan as of  the Closing Date. The Company shall pay,
immediately prior to the Closing,  and be responsible for, the retention,
transaction or similar bonuses  arising on or prior to the Closing Date for
Company Employees as well as  those identified on Schedule 6(c)(i) attached
hereto. The bonuses  described in the preceding sentence shall not be
included in the  determination of Current Liabilities for purposes of the
calculation of  Working Capital to the extent they are paid by the Company on
or prior to  the Closing Date. The Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any
payments  becoming due or liabilities arising under any Company Plan with
respect to  the employment or termination of employment of any Company
Employee prior  to the Closing Date and for any liability arising under Title
IV of ERISA  by reason of the Company\'s membership in a controlled group
under Section  414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.   (ii) Health Plan
Coverage. On and after the Closing Date, the Buyer  shall offer group health
plan coverage to each Company Employee (and to  the spouse and dependents of
each such employee) on terms and conditions  substantially comparable to
those generally applicable prior to the  Closing Date. For purposes of
providing such coverage, the Buyer shall  waive all preexisting condition
waiting periods and limitations for each  Company Employee (and for the
spouse and dependents of each such Company  Employee) covered by a Company
Plan that is a group health care plan  immediately prior to the Closing Date
(to the extent that such waiting  periods and limitations   did not apply
to such Company Employee, spouse or dependent immediately  prior to the
Closing Date) and shall provide such health care coverage  effective as of
the Closing Date without the application of any  eligibility period for
coverage except to the extent an eligibility period  applied immediately
prior to the Closing Date. In addition, the Buyer  shall credit all payments
made by a Company Employee (and the spouse and  dependents of such Company
Employee) toward deductible, out-of-pocket and  co-payment obligation limits
under the applicable Company Plan for the  plan year which includes the
Closing Date, as if such payments had been  made for similar purposes under
the health care plans offered to the  Company Employees (and their spouses
and dependents) on and after the  Closing Date during the plan year which
includes the Closing Date. .   (iii) Savings Plan Transfer. As of the
Closing Date, the Seller  shall, or shall cause any of its Affiliates to,
fully vest all current  Company Employees in the Centennial PR Operations
Corporation Retirement  Investment Plan ("Seller\'s Savings Plan"). As soon
as practicable (but in  no event later than 120 days after the Closing Date),
the Buyer shall  establish, or shall cause the Company to establish, a
defined contribution  pension plan ("Buyer\'s Savings Plan") intended to be
qualified under  Section 401(a) of the Code, if applicable, and Sections
1165(a) and  1165(e) of the PRIRC for the benefit of Company Employees (and 
beneficiaries thereof) who have an account balance under the Seller\'s 
Savings Plan at the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the 
Closing Date, but in no event later than 120 days thereafter, the Seller 
shall cause, or cause its Affiliates to cause, a transfer of the account 
balances, valued as of the date of transfer, of Company Employees from 
Seller\'s Saving Plan and related trust to Buyer\'s Savings Plan and related 
trust, and the Buyer shall cause Buyer\'s Savings Plan and related trust to 
accept such transfer of assets and assume liability for the amount 
transferred. As a precondition to this transfer of account balances,  Seller
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, request in writing  of the
Puerto Rico Department of Treasury ("PRDT") that PRDT either (i)  amend the
favorable determination letter it issued with respect to the  Seller\'s
Savings Plan dated August 24, 2004 to specifically reference the  Company as
a participating employer under such Seller\'s Savings the Plan,  (ii)
specifically acknowledge in a separate writing that the Company is an 
Employer covered by the terms of said letter, or (iii) specifically 
acknowledge in a separate writing that the letter is broad enough to cover 
the Company\'s participation in the Seller\'s Savings Plan without any such 
specific reference. Such transfer of assets shall be in cash and loan  notes
unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. Unless the Seller and  Buyer
agree otherwise in writing, the transfer shall occur as of the last  Business
Day of a month.   Prior to the date of such transfer, and as a precondition
thereto, the Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence that the Buyer\'s Savings
Plan (i) has been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, if applicable,
and the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury for a determination that
Buyer\'s Savings Plan is qualified under the Code, if applicable, and under
the PRIRC, respectively and (ii) contains the terms and provisions necessary
to preserve Code Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits, if applicable, and any
counterpart provisions of ERISA or the PRIRC, if applicable. Subsequent to
the transfer of assets to Buyer\'s Savings Plan, neither  Seller or
Seller\'s Savings Plan shall retain any obligation or liability with respect
to the account balance transferred hereunder, and neither the Buyer
nor Buyer\'s Savings Plan shall have any obligation or liability with respect
to any accounts under Seller\'s Savings Plan other than those liabilities
with respect to the account balances transferred hereunder.   Effective as
of the date of the transfer, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller and Seller\'s Savings Plan from and against any liability or expense,
including, but not limited to, the payment of attorneys\' fees, which the
Seller or Seller\'s Savings Plan may incur in connection with any actions or
claim brought against Seller, Seller\'s Savings Plan and their officers,
fiduciaries or agents with respect to the payment of any
benefits attributable to the account balances transferred to the Buyer\'s
Savings Plan hereunder, but only to the extent that such liability or expense
arises after the date of the transfer of the account balances to the Buyer\'s
Savings Plan and is the result of any action or omission of the Buyer or a
fiduciary of Buyer\'s Savings Plan.   This Section 6(c) shall operate
exclusively for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and not for the
benefit of any other Person, including, without limitation, any current,
former or retired Company Employee or spouse or dependents of such
Persons.   (d) Tax Matters.   (i) The Seller shall be responsible for, and
shall defend,  reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties  against and in respect of, all Adverse Consequences that may be
incurred  by or imposed on any Buyer Indemnified Party that result from,
relate to,  or arise out of: (A) all Taxes of the Company for any taxable
period  ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and (B) with respect to any 
Straddle Period, all Taxes of the Company allocable to the portion of such 
period ending on the Closing Date, (C) all Taxes imposed on any member of  an
Affiliated Group of which the Company is or was a member on or prior to  the
Closing Date by reason of the liability of the Company pursuant to  Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor  thereof or
any analogous or similar provision under state, local or  foreign Law), (D)
any income Taxes resulting from, arising out of or based  on the Section
338(h)(10) Election, and (E) the Seller\'s failure to  perform any covenant
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document  with respect to Taxes,
other than, in the case of each of subsections (A)  through (E) above, the
amount of Tax actually taken into account as, and  increasing, current
liabilities in calculating the Working Capital  adjustment (excluding any
provisions for deferred Taxes established to  reflect differences between the
treatment of items for accounting and  income tax purposes) and any Taxes
resulting from any action taken after  the Closing on the Closing Date
without the Seller\'s consent, not  contemplated herein and not in the
Ordinary Course of Business.   (ii) The Buyer shall be responsible for, and
shall defend,  reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties  against and in respect of, all Adverse Consequences that may be
incurred  by or imposed on any Seller Indemnified Party that result from,
relate to,  or arise out of: (A) all Taxes of the Company for any taxable
period  beginning after the Closing Date, (B) with respect to any Straddle
Period,  all Taxes of the Company allocable to the post-Closing Date portion
of  such period   pursuant to Section 6(d)(iii), (C) all Taxes taken into
account as current  liabilities in calculating the Working Capital adjustment
(excluding any  provision for deferred Taxes established to reflect
differences between  the treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes),
(D) any Taxes  resulting from any action taken after the Closing on the
Closing Date  without the Seller\'s consent, not contemplated herein and not
in the  Ordinary Course of Business, and (E) the Buyer\'s failure to perform
any  covenant contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document with 
respect to Taxes.   (iii) The Seller and the Buyer shall, unless prohibited
by  applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Company as of the close
of  business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the 
Company to close its taxable year on the Closing Date or in the case of 
Taxes payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the amount of such  Taxes
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the  Closing Date
shall (A) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to  income or gross
receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be  payable if the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and (B)  in the case of
any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income  or gross
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire  Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the  number of days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing  Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire  Straddle Period.
Any allocation of income or deductions required to  determine any Taxes
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into  account as though the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date  and by means of a closing
of the books and records of the Company as of  the close of the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or  deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including, but not  limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated  between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the  Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period. All  determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall  be made in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company.   (iv) The Seller shall be responsible for the
preparation and timely  filing of: (A) all Tax Returns of the Company that
are required to be  filed (with regard to extensions) on or prior to the
Closing Date, and (B)  all Tax Returns of the Company that are filed on a
consolidated, combined  or unitary basis with the Seller or any Affiliate of
the Seller for any  taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
including the  federal income Tax Return for the taxable period of the
Company ending on  the Closing Date and included in the consolidated federal
income Tax  Return of the Centennial Affiliated Group.   (v) The Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and timely  filing of all Tax
Returns of the Company not referred to in Section  6(d)(iv)(B) above that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date;  provided, however, that in
preparing any Tax Returns of the Company for  any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date (including Tax  Returns for any Straddle Period to
the extent they relate to Taxes for  which the Seller is responsible
hereunder), the Buyer shall provide the  Seller with drafts of such Tax
Returns (together with any relevant back-up  information) for review by the
Seller and consultation between Buyer and  Seller at least 20 days prior to
filing. All Tax Returns   for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning on or prior to the  Closing Date shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with the  past practice of the Company except as may be
necessary to make and  reflect the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Seller
and the Buyer shall  attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Tax  Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event
that the Seller and  the Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect
to such Tax  Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing,
such  dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 6(d)(xi), which
resolution  shall be binding on the parties.   (vi) The Seller shall have
the right to control any audit,  litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes (a "Tax Proceeding")  involving the Company to the extent it relates
exclusively to Taxes for  which the Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Buyer  shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding
involving the Company  to the extent it relates exclusively to Taxes for
which the Buyer is  responsible pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither  party shall settle, compromise or abandon such
proceeding without the  consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably  withheld, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment
would adversely  affect such other party. Any other Tax Proceeding involving
the Company  shall be controlled by the Buyer; provided, however, that the
Buyer shall  not settle, compromise or abandon such proceeding without the
consent of  the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if
such  settlement, compromise or abandonment would require the Seller to make
any  payments or otherwise adversely affect the Seller, and the Seller
shall  have the right to participate in such proceeding at its own expense.
Each  of the Seller and the Buyer shall deliver to the other party, as the
case  may be, any notice received from any Governmental Entity relating to
Taxes  with respect to which such other party is or may be liable pursuant
to  this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure of any party to
give  the other party notice as provided herein shall not relieve such
other  party of its obligations under this Section 6(d) except to the extent
that  such other party is materially adversely affected or damaged
thereby.   (vii) The Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
any  Taxes for which it is responsible (other than, in the case of any Tax 
described in any of subsections (A) through (E) of Section 6(d)(i), the 
amount of Tax refunds or credits actually taken into account as, and 
increasing, current assets in calculating the Working Capital adjustment) 
pursuant to Section 6(d)(i) (including any interest in respect thereof),  and
the Buyer shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of any other  Taxes of
the Company (including any interest in respect thereof). The  Buyer or the
Seller, as the case may be, shall cause the amount of any  refunds or credits
of Taxes (including interest) to which the Seller or  the Buyer, as the case
may be, is entitled under this Section 6(d)(vii),  but which are received by
or credited to the Company or the Seller, as the  case may be, after the
Closing Date, to be paid to the Seller or the  Buyer, as the case may be,
within five (5) Business Days following such  receipt or crediting.  
(viii) The Buyer agrees that it shall not amend any Tax Return of  the
Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date  without the
prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not  be unreasonably
withheld. In addition,   each party at the request of the other party,
shall, or shall cause the  Company to, cooperate with such other party in
seeking any Tax refunds or  credits described in Section 6(d)(vii).   (ix)
The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the  extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the  filing of
any Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6(d) and any Tax  Proceeding
involving the Company. Such cooperation shall include the  retention and
(upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records  and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or  Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient  basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material  provided hereunder.
Such cooperation shall also include the provision by  the Seller or the
Buyer, as the case may be, to the other party any  reasonably requested power
of attorney with respect to Tax Returns or Tax  Proceedings involving the
Company in order to carry out the agreements set  forth in this Section 6(d).
The Seller and the Buyer further agree (A) to  retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the  Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date  until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent  notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the  respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention  agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, and
(B) to give the  other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or  discarding any such books and records, and, if the other party
so  requests, the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall allow the 
other party within reasonable time to take possession of such books and 
records to the extent they would otherwise be destroyed or discarded.   (x)
The Seller and Centennial and the Buyer shall, or shall cause  their
respective Affiliates to, join together to make a timely and  irrevocable
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (the "Section  338(h)(10)
Election"), with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock  of the
Company hereunder. In connection with the making of such Section  338(h)(10)
Election: (A) the Seller and Centennial and the Buyer shall  report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistent with  such election
and shall take no position contrary thereto, and (B) the  Seller and the
Buyer shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to,  cooperate in
promptly preparing, executing, and timely filing all forms,  returns, reports
and other documents required to be filed, including IRS  Form 8023 (or any
successor form). As soon as practicable following the  Closing, the Seller
and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to reach  agreement regarding the
allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted,  among the assets of the
Company in accordance with the requirements of  Section 338 of the Code and
the applicable Treasury Regulations  promulgated thereunder; provided,
however, that if the Seller and the  Buyer have not reached agreement on such
allocation by the 90th day after  the Closing Date, then such allocation
shall be made in accordance with  the appraisal of a recognized appraisal
firm chosen and retained by mutual  agreement of the Seller and the Buyer,
the fees and expenses of which  shall be paid one-half by the Seller and one-
half by the Buyer. The Seller  and the Buyer shall reflect such allocation in
all applicable income Tax  Returns filed by any of them, and neither the
Seller nor the Buyer shall,  or shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
take a position before any  Governmental Entity or otherwise (including in
any Tax Return)  inconsistent with such allocation. The Buyer   shall not
take, and after the Closing shall not cause or permit the  Company to take,
any action which would adversely affect the ability of  the parties to make
the Section 338(h)(10) Election.   (xi) Except as otherwise provided, any
dispute as to any Tax matter  covered by this Section 6(d) shall be resolved
by the Unaffiliated Firm.  The fees and expenses of the Unaffiliated Firm
shall be borne equally by  the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other. If any dispute  with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to
the due date of such  Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner which the party  responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems
correct; provided,  however, that upon the final resolution of such dispute,
the Seller and  the Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly reimburse the
other as  needed to conform to the resolution of such dispute by the
Unaffiliated  Firm.   (xii) Any Tax allocation, indemnity, or similar
agreement or  arrangement between the Seller and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and  the Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated on or prior to
the  Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable year 
(whether the current year, a future year or past year).   (xiii) The Seller
and the Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment  made pursuant to this
Section 6(d) or Section 8 as an adjustment to the  Purchase Price for
federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.   (xiv) The
provisions set forth in this Section 6(d): (A) shall  survive the Closing
hereunder until sixty days after the expiration of the  applicable statute of
limitations (including any valid extensions thereof,  whether automatic or
permissive), (B) shall not be subject to any of the  limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 8(g) of this Agreement  and (C) the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6(d) shall be the  sole remedy
for any claim in respect of any Taxes described in clauses (A)  through (E)
of Section 6(d)(i) and in clauses (A) through (E) of Section  6(d)(ii), and
in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this  Section 6(d), on
the one hand, and the provisions of Section 8 hereof, on  the other, the
provisions of this Section 6(d) shall control. For the  avoidance of doubt,
any claim arising out of or relating to a breach of a  representation or
warranty contained in Section 3(h) that is not otherwise  covered in this
Section 6(d) shall be governed exclusively by the  provisions of Section 8,
and not by this Section 6(d). Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in  this Agreement shall
prohibit the Buyer or the Seller from otherwise  seeking injunctive relief
(including specific performance) in connection  with a breach of Buyer\'s or
Seller\'s respective obligations to make the  Section 338(h)(10)
Election.   (e) Notice of Disqualification. The Buyer shall promptly notify
the  Seller in writing if the Buyer becomes aware of any facts which would,
under  present law and present rules, regulations and policies of the
applicable  Governmental Entities, disqualify the Buyer with respect to the
consummation  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without  limitation, the change of control affecting the Licenses and the
Material  Contracts in connection with the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement or that would prevent the Telecommunications 
Regulatory   Board\'s consenting to the change of control affecting the
Franchises in  connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.   (f) Use of Name and Logos.   (i) The
Buyer shall remove, following the Closing, all of the  trademarks, trade
names, service marks, service names, logos and similar  proprietary rights of
the Seller, including, without limitation, any of  the foregoing that include
the name "CENTENNIAL" or any variant thereof  (collectively, the "Centennial
Marks") from the Company\'s assets to the  extent incorporated therein or
thereon including the Company\'s vehicles,  marketing and promotional
materials, retail outlets and advertising  (collectively, the "Centennial
Marketing Materials"); provided, that  Seller hereby grants the Company a
non-exclusive, revocable license to use  such Centennial Marks without charge
for transitional purposes for a  period of six (6) months following the
Closing, subject to the terms and  conditions set forth herein (the "Original
Use Right"). Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Seller shall grant the Company a
non-exclusive, revocable  license to continue to use the Centennial Marks for
an additional three  (3) months following the expiration of the six (6) month
anniversary of  the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein  (the "Further Use Right") if (A) after using its Commercially
Reasonable  Efforts, the Company has not removed the Centennial Marks from
all the  Centennial Marketing Materials and the Company still needs to use
the  Centennial Marks for transitional purposes and the Company is otherwise
in  compliance with the provisions of this Section 6(f), and (B) Buyer 
provides a written request to Seller at least twenty (20) days prior to  the
expiration of the Original Use Right detailing the reasons why Buyer  needs
to continue to use the Centennial Marks after the six (6) month  anniversary
of the Closing.   (ii) Seller may revoke the Original Use Right and the
Further Use  Right upon a breach by the Company of any of the provisions of
this  Section 6(f), in the event that Company fails to cure such breach
within  ten (10) days of receiving notice of such alleged breach from Seller.
In  connection with the Company`s use of the Centennial Marks pursuant to
the  Original Use Right and the Further Use Right, Buyer agrees with Seller
as  follows: (v) the Centennial Marks indicate to the public that the
services  bearing the Centennial Marks are of commercially consistent, high
quality  standards, and Buyer shall maintain such a consistent level of
quality,  which level of quality shall not be inferior to the level of
quality  established by the services provided by Seller and its Affiliates as
of  the Closing Date, so as to enhance the value and goodwill of the
business  associated with and symbolized by the Centennial Marks; (w) Seller
shall  not, and shall cause the Company not to, falsely imply or suggest
any  connection between the business and operations of the Company and the 
business and operations of Seller and its Affiliates; (x) upon request by 
Seller, Buyer shall provide Seller with specimens of the Company\'s use of 
the Centennial Marks for Seller\'s inspection; (y) the Company shall use 
appropriate notification of the trademark rights or registration on all 
visual displays of the Centennial Marks, including use of the encircled  "R"
symbol, and/or the letters TM or SM, as appropriate; and (z) Buyer  shall
cause the Company not to use any of the Centennial Marks in a way  which
reflects negatively on Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of  their
remaining businesses or the Centennial Marks. Without limiting the  
foregoing, the Buyer agrees to change the name of the Company to a name 
which does not include any of the Centennial Marks, within six (6) months 
after the Closing. In no event shall the Company have any right to use the 
Centennial Marks after the nine (9) month anniversary of the Closing Date.  
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  Agreement,
Buyer acknowledges that the Centennial Marks are of unique and  special value
to Seller and its Affiliates and any damage to the  Centennial brand will
cause Seller and its Affiliates irreparable harm.  Buyer and Seller agree
that the covenants and undertakings contained in  this Section 6(f) relate to
matters which are of special, unique and  extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this  Section 6(f) will cause irreparable
injury to Seller and its Affiliates,  the amount of which will be impossible
to estimate or determine and which  cannot be adequately compensated.
Therefore, Seller shall be entitled to  an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court  of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this Section 6(f)  by Buyer. The rights and remedies
provided by this Section 6(f) are  cumulative and in addition to any other
rights and remedies which Buyer  may have hereunder or at law or in
equity.   (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement if the Company ceases all use of the Centennial Marks on or  before
the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and terminates  the
Original Use Right and the Further Use Right by such six month  anniversary,
then Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later than fifteen (15)  days after
receipt by Seller of notice from Buyer that the Company has  ceased such use
and terminated the Original Use Right and the Further Use  Right, an amount
equal to$438,000. Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this
Agreement if the Company ceases all use of the  Centennial Marks after the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,  but on or before the nine (9)
month anniversary of the Closing Date and  terminates the Original Use Right
and the Further Use Right after such six  month anniversary but on or before
such nine month anniversary, then  Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later than
fifteen (15) days after receipt  by Seller of notice from Buyer that the
Company has ceased such use and  terminated the Original Use Right and the
Further Use Right, an amount  equal to the difference between (I) $438,000,
and (II) the product of  $4,866.67, multiplied by the number of days between
the six (6) month  anniversary of the Closing Date and the date on which the
Company ceases  all use of the Centennial Marks and terminates the Original
Use Right and  the Further Use Right. All payments to be made by Seller to
Buyer pursuant  to this Section 6(f)(iv) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately  available funds to the account of Buyer notified by Buyer to
Seller.   (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the  Original Use Right and the Further Use Right shall terminate upon a
Change  of Control of the Company after the Closing, and the Original Use
Right  and the Further Use Right may not be transferred or assigned by the 
Company to any other Person.   (g) Non-Solicit and Confidentiality.   (i)
For a period of eighteen (18) calendar months from and after the  Closing
Date, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,  directly
or indirectly cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees  of the
Company who are or become employees of Buyer or its Affiliates and  are
employees of Buyer or its Affiliates at the time of such causation, 
solicitation, inducement or encouragement, to leave such employment or  hire,
employ or otherwise engage any such individual who is an employee of  Buyer
or its Affiliates at the time of such hiring, employment or other 
engagement; provided, however, that this Section 6(g)(i) shall not  prohibit
any advertisement or general solicitation (or hiring as a result  thereof)
that is not specifically targeted at such persons.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Seller, and the  Seller shall cause its
Affiliates not to, for a period of nine months (or  such shorter period as
set forth on Schedule 6(g)) from the Closing Date,  employ any of the
individuals listed on Schedule 6(g), except that such  limitation shall not
apply with respect to a particular individual to the  extent (x) such
individual is not employed by the Company at Closing as a  result of the
Buyer and such individual failing to come to mutually  agreeable terms
regarding such individual\'s employment with the Company;  provided, that
Seller and its Affiliates did not otherwise violate the  provisions of this
Section 6(g)(i) with respect to such individual; (y)  such individual is
involuntarily terminated by the Company on or after the  Closing Date; or (z)
Buyer otherwise consents to the Seller or any of its  Affiliates hiring such
individual.   (ii) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing
Date,  the Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly
or  indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person
other  than Buyer and its Affiliates and Buyer\'s and its Affiliates\'
authorized  officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, financial
advisors  and representatives of Buyer or, subject to the proviso set forth
herein,  use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of
any  Person other than Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective officers, 
directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and other 
representatives, any Confidential Information (as defined below). The  Seller
shall not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause the  Company or
its officers, directors or Affiliates to keep confidential) any  Confidential
Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is  specifically required
by Law; provided, however, that in the event  disclosure is required by
applicable Law, the Seller shall, to the extent  reasonably possible, provide
Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement  prior to making any disclosure
so that Buyer may seek an appropriate  protective order. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Confidential  Information" shall be limited to (x) the subscriber
lists of the Company  and all other confidential and proprietary information
about the Company\'s  current and former subscribers, (y) any confidential
and proprietary  information with respect to the Company\'s overall network
configuration  and infrastructure, including, without limitation, the
locations of homes  capable of receiving high speed data service from the
Company, the  Company\'s current and planned product offerings and the
Company\'s plans to  expand its network to reach additional homes, and (z)
the names of the  Company\'s employees and information with respect to the
Company\'s salary  structure and the Company\'s benefit plans for employees.
"Confidential  Information" does not include, and there shall be no
obligation   hereunder with respect to, information that (A) is generally
available to  the public on the date of this Agreement, (B) becomes generally
available  to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not
otherwise  permissible thereunder, (C) is or becomes available to the Seller
or its  Affiliates from a source that is not known to be bound by a 
confidentiality agreement or (D) is independently developed by Seller or  its
Affiliates without the use of Confidential Information. The Buyer 
acknowledges that the Seller and its Affiliates are in businesses that  may,
now or in the future, be in competition with the Company, and the  Buyer
agrees that this Agreement in no way limits or restricts the  Seller\'s and
its Affiliates\' right or ability to conduct any business.   (iii) The
covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6(g)  relate to matters
which are of a special, unique and extraordinary  character and a violation
of any of the terms of this Section 6(g) will  cause irreparable injury to
the parties, the amount of which will be  impossible to estimate or determine
and which cannot be adequately  compensated. Therefore, Buyer will be
entitled to an injunction,  restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent  jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this
Section 6(g). The rights  and remedies provided by this Section 6(g) are
cumulative and in addition  to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may
have hereunder or at law  or in equity.   7. Conditions to Obligation to

transactions contemplated by  this Agreement and not for any other purpose,
including, without  limitation, modifying or limiting Buyer\'s rights to
indemnification under  Sections 6(d) and 8(a)(i), so long as the failure of

or taken together,  would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect;  provided, further, that the representations and warranties
of the Seller  set forth in Section 3(b) shall be true and correct in all
respects  without regard to the foregoing Material Adverse Effect
qualification. For  purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the Parties acknowledge

in effect any order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling, writ,  assessment
or arbitration award of a Governmental Entity of competent  jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the  consummation of the

not be entitled to rely on the failure of this  condition to be satisfied if
such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand,  order, injunction, judgment,
decree, ruling, writ, assessment or  arbitration award was instituted by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer.   (vi) all applicable waiting periods (and

and able to lend to the Buyer the funds contemplated by the  Financing

satisfied solely as a result of a failure of HMTF Fund V  Cayman, L. P. or
its Affiliates to make the Equity Contribution after all  conditions to its
obligations to make such Equity Contribution are  satisfied (excluding solely
the availability of funds under the Financing  Commitment if not available
due to the unavailability of the Equity  Contribution) or if Buyer shall have

the Closing, any Person entitled to  indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnified Party") asserts a  claim for indemnification for or receives
notice of the assertion or  commencement of any Third Party Claim as to which
such Indemnified Party  intends to seek indemnification under this Agreement,
such Indemnified  Party shall give reasonably prompt written notice of such
claim to the  Party from whom indemnification is to be sought (an
"Indemnifying Party"),  together with a statement of any available
information regarding such  claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to  the Indemnified Party (the "Defense Notice")
within 15 days after receipt  from the Indemnified Party of notice of such
claim, by which notice the  Indemnifying Party shall specify the counsel it
will appoint to defend  such claim ("Defense Counsel"), to conduct at its
expense the defense  against such Third Party Claim in its own name, or if
necessary in the  name of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
Indemnified  Party shall have the right to approve the Defense Counsel, which
approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The parties hereto
agree to  cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, 
negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying 
Party delivers a Defense Notice   to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party will cooperate with and  make available to the Indemnifying Party such
assistance and materials as  may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party, all at the expense  of the Indemnifying Party.   (ii) If the
Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense Notice,  it shall be deemed
to have elected not to conduct the defense of the  subject Third Party Claim,
and in such event the Indemnified Party shall  have the right to conduct such
defense in good faith. If the Indemnified  Party defends any Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall  reimburse the Indemnified Party for
the costs and expenses of defending  such Third Party Claim upon submission
of periodic bills. If the  Indemnifying Party elects to conduct the defense
of the subject Third  Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at
his or its own  expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that  such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such  defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
if  (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in
the  reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or 
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the  Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation advisable;  and provided,
further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required  to pay for more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection  with any Third
Party Claim.   (iii) Regardless of which Party defends a Third Party Claim
(other  than a Third Party Claim relating to Taxes the procedures for which
shall  be solely and exclusively governed by Section 6(d)), the other Party
shall  have the right at its expense to participate in the defense of such
Third  Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own choosing. The
Indemnified  Party shall not compromise, settle, default on, or admit
liability with  respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the  Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or  delayed, and, if the Indemnified Party settles, compromises,
defaults on,  or admits liability with respect to a Third Party Claim except
in  compliance with the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will be liable for 
all costs, expenses, settlement amounts, or other Adverse Consequences  paid
or incurred in connection therewith and the Indemnifying Party shall  have no
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect  thereto. The
Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle a Third  Party Claim (other
than a Third Party Claim relating to Taxes the  procedures for which shall be
solely and exclusively governed by Section  6(d)) without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall  not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless such compromise or  settlement includes as a term thereof an
unconditional release of the  Indemnified Party and such compromise or
release does not impose any  material non-monetary obligations on the
Indemnified Party (and all  monetary obligations are subject to the
indemnification provisions of this  Agreement) in which case the consent of
the Indemnified Party shall not be  required.   (iv) After any final
decision, judgment or award shall have been  rendered by a Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction and the  expiration of the time in which to
appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall  have been consummated, or the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party  shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third  Party Claim hereunder,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the  Indemnifying Party notice of any
sums due and owing by the Indemnifying  Party   pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to such matter and the  Indemnifying Party shall be required to
pay all of the sums so due and  owing to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer of immediately available  funds within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of such notice.   (d) Direct Claims. It is the intent of the
Parties that all direct  claims by an Indemnified Party against a Party not
arising out of Third  Party Claims shall be subject to and benefit from the
terms of this Section  8. Any claim under this Section 8 by an Indemnified
Party for  indemnification other than indemnification against a Third Party
Claim (a  "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably  prompt written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will
have a period  of 20 days within which to satisfy such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying  Party does not so respond within such 20 day period, the
Indemnifying Party  will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which
event the Indemnified  Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the  Indemnified Party under this Section 8.   (e) Failure to
Give Timely Notice. A failure by an Indemnified Party  to give timely,
complete, or accurate notice as provided in Section 8(c) or  8(d) shall not
affect the rights or obligations of either Party hereunder  except to the
extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party entitled  to receive such
notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment  under its applicable
insurance coverage or was otherwise materially  adversely affected or damaged
as a result of such failure to give timely,  complete, and accurate
notice.   (f) Reduction of Adverse Consequences. The Parties shall use
their  Commercially Reasonable Efforts to collect the proceeds of any
insurance  that would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences
(in which  case such proceeds shall reduce such Adverse Consequences). To the
extent  any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified Party are reduced by
receipt of  payment under insurance policies or from third parties not
affiliated with  the Indemnified Party, such payments (net of the expenses of
the recovery  thereof) shall be credited against such Adverse Consequences
and, if  indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the
collection of  such proceeds, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the
Indemnifying Party  the amount of such proceeds (net of the cost of
collection thereof) to the  extent of indemnification payments received in
respect of such Adverse  Consequences.   (g) Limitations on
Indemnities.   (i) The Seller shall not have any liability pursuant to
Section  8(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Adverse
Consequences  subject to this Section 8(g)(i) exceeds the Threshold Amount,
and then the  Seller shall have liability only for the amount of such
Adverse  Consequences in excess of the Threshold Amount; provided, that
this  Section 8(g)(i) shall not apply to a breach of any representation or 
warranty contained in Section 3(a) (Organization), Section 3(b) 
(Capitalization), Section 3(c)(i) (Authorization of Transaction), Section 
3(d) (Brokers\' Fees), or Section 3(e) (Subsidiaries).   (ii) The Buyer
shall not have any liability pursuant to Section  8(b)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences subject to  this Section
8(g)(ii) exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then the Buyer  shall have
liability only for the amount of such Adverse Consequences in  excess of the
Threshold Amount; provided, that this Section 8(g)(ii) shall  not apply to a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in  Section 4(a)
(Organization), Section 4(b)(i) (Authorization of  Transaction), Section 4(c)
(Brokers\' Fees) or Section 4(g) (Investment  Purpose).   (iii) The
Seller\'s aggregate liability under Section 8(a)(i) shall  be limited in the
aggregate to 10% of the Purchase Price; provided, that  this Section
8(g)(iii) shall not apply to a breach of any representation  or warranty
contained in Section 3(a) (Organization), Section 3(b)  (Capitalization),
Section 3(c)(i) (Authorization of Transaction), Section  3(d) (Brokers\'
Fees) or Section 3(e) (Subsidiaries). Without limiting the  other limitations
on the indemnification responsibilities of Seller set  forth herein, in no
event shall the aggregate liability of the Seller for  indemnity under this
Section 8 exceed the amount of the Purchase Price.   (iv) For purposes of
calculating Adverse Consequences hereunder (but  not for purposes of
determining whether any particular representation,  warranty or covenant
contained herein has been breached), any materiality  or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications in the representations,  warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be ignored.   (v) To the extent that a Party has a payment
obligation to the other  Party for indemnification pursuant to this Section
8, such obligated Party  shall have the right to offset such payment
obligations against amounts  owed, if any, by such other Party to the
obligated Party under Section  2(f)(v).   (vi) Subject to Section 8(i), in
no event shall any Party be liable  under this Section 8 for punitive,
treble, exemplary or other damages that  are not actual damages in accordance
with Law; provided, however, that,  subject to any limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Agreement,  to the extent a Third Party
Claim includes such punitive, treble,  exemplary or other damages that are
not actual damages in accordance with  Law and are otherwise indemnifiable
under this Section 8, such punitive,  treble, exemplary or other damages
shall be included in determining such  Party\'s Adverse Consequences relating
to such third party claim.   (h) Survival. All representations, warranties,
covenants, and  agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the
execution and  delivery of this Agreement and the Closing hereunder;
provided, that, except  as provided in the next sentence, the representations
and warranties shall  expire on, and any claim for indemnification with
respect thereto must be  brought before, the date which is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing  Date; provided, further, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, each covenant  or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed after the Closing  shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statutes of   limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims
for indemnification with  respect to a breach of a Surviving Representation
may be brought at any time  until 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statutes of  limitations, except for the Surviving Representations
set forth in Section  3(q) (Environmental Matters), which shall expire five
years after the  Closing Date, and the Surviving Representations set forth in
Sections 3(b)  (Capitalization) and 3(c)(i) (Authorization of Transaction),
which shall  survive indefinitely.   (i) Exclusivity. After the Closing,
the indemnification provided by  this Section 8 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for the Buyer for any  claim (whether such claim is framed
in tort, contract or otherwise) arising  out of a breach of any
representations, warranty, covenant or other  agreement herein (other than
the covenants of Seller relating to Taxes  provided for in Section 6(d), the
indemnification for which shall be solely  and exclusively governed by
Section 6(d)) or otherwise arising out of or in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than  the Transition
Services Agreement) or the operations of the Company;  provided, that this
Section 8(i) shall not prohibit (i) injunctive relief  (including specific
performance) if available under applicable Law or (ii)  any other remedy
available at law or in equity for any fraud committed or  made by the Seller
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.   (j)
Interest. Seller shall pay the Buyer Indemnified Parties interest  at the
rate of three percent (3%) per annum on any amounts due to third  parties in
respect of the indemnification provided by Section 8(a)(iv) from  the Closing
Date through the date of any such payment.   9. Termination.   (a)
Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may, by written  notice given prior
to or at the Closing, be terminated as follows:   (i) By (A) the Seller (if
the Seller is not in breach or default of  its representations, warranties or
covenants hereunder in a manner which  would cause the conditions to Closing
set forth in Section 7(a)(i) or  Section 7(a)(ii) not to be satisfied) if the
Buyer breaches in any  material respect any of its covenants contained herein
and such breach  remains uncured 30 days after the date of written notice
from the Seller  to the Buyer of such breach, or (B) the Buyer (if the Buyer
is not in  breach or default of its representations, warranties or
covenants  hereunder in a manner which would cause the conditions to Closing
set  forth in Section 7(b)(i) or Section 7(b)(ii) not to be satisfied) if
the  Seller breaches in any material respect any of its covenants contained 
herein and such breach remains uncured 30 days after the date of written 
notice from the Buyer to the Seller of such breach;   (ii) by mutual consent
of the Buyer and the Seller; or   (iii) by either the Buyer or the Seller,
if the Closing has not  taken place by the date which is eight (8) months
from the date of this  Agreement (the "Upset Date"); provided that a Party
may not terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 9(a)(iii) if the
failure of the Closing  to have taken place on or before such date is
attributable to the failure  of the Party seeking to terminate to comply in
any material respect with  its obligations hereunder.   (iv) by the Seller
or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final  nonappealable order,
injunction, judgment, decree, ruling, writ,  assessment or arbitration award
of a Governmental Body of competent  jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; it being agreed that  the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination which  is not nonappealable (and use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to pursue  such appeal with reasonable diligence);   (b)
Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement  pursuant to
Section 9(a), this Agreement shall terminate and the  transactions
contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action  by any of the
Parties hereto; provided that the provisions of this Section  9, the second
sentence of Section 5(d) and Section 10 and the  Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive such termination. If this Agreement  is terminated as provided
herein, none of the Parties hereto shall have any  further obligation or
liability to the other Parties hereto, except as set  forth in the preceding
sentence and the following sentence. Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained herein, neither Seller nor Buyer shall  have any liability
for any breach of this Agreement prior to the effective  date of a
termination, other than for an intentional breach.   10. Miscellaneous.  
(a) Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any  press
release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter  of
this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of 
the other Party which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed; provided, however, that (i) immediately following the execution 
hereof, the Parties will jointly issue a press release announcing their 
entry into of this Agreement, (ii) any Party may make any public disclosure 
it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any listing or 
trading agreement or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or 
automated securities quotation system concerning its publicly-traded 
securities (in which case the disclosing Party will, to the extent permitted 
by applicable Law, any such listing or trading agreement, rules or 
regulations, use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to advise the other 
Party prior to making the disclosure) and (iii) the Seller may disclose 
information about this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in 
the ordinary course in connection with its investor relations practices.  
(b) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 8,  this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other  than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   (c)
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits  hereto and the
Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents and all  documents and
certificates to be delivered pursuant hereto collectively  constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the  subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede any prior negotiations,  understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties,  written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter  hereof.   (d)
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon  and inure to
the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective  successors and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement  or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior  written
approval of the other Party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Buyer
may, without the approval of any other Party to this Agreement,  but with
prior notice to Seller, assign this Agreement and any or all rights  or
obligations hereunder (including, without limitation, Buyer\'s rights to 
purchase the Company Shares and Buyer\'s rights to seek indemnification 
hereunder) to any Affiliate of Buyer and may make a collateral assignment of 
this Agreement to any Person from which it has borrowed money, in each case, 
as long as the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the representations 
and warranties of the Buyer contained in this Agreement are true and correct 
with respect to such assignee as of the date of such assignment, (ii) the 
assignee is otherwise able to comply with the covenants and agreements of 
Buyer set forth in this Agreement and satisfy the conditions to Seller\'s 
obligation to close set forth in Sections 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii), 7(b)(iii), 
7(b)(viii) and 7(b)(ix); and (iii) such assignment does not hinder or delay 
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon 
any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Buyer 
shall refer to such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.   (e)
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered  (including by
facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, each of  which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together will constitute  one and the
same instrument.   (f) Headings. The section headings contained in this
Agreement are  inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or  interpretation of this Agreement.   (g) Notices. All
notices, requests, demands, claims, and other  communications hereunder will

Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction.   (i) This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance  with the domestic laws of the State of New
York without giving effect to  any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of  New York or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of  the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of New York.   (ii) ANY LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY RELATED
TO THIS  AGREEMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS 
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN), ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE BUYER OR THE  SELLER
WILL BE BROUGHT AND   MAINTAINED IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
LOCATED IN NEW YORK  COUNTY OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT COURT  FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY
SUCH  LITIGATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY

CONSENTS  TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL,
POSTAGE  PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.  EACH OF THE BUYER AND THE SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES,  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY
HAVE OR  HEREAFTER MAY HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION
BROUGHT  IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH
LITIGATION  HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
BUYER OR  THE SELLER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM
JURISDICTION OF  ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE
OR NOTICE,  ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR
OTHERWISE)  WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THEN EACH OF THE BUYER
AND THE  SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF THIS 
AGREEMENT.   (i) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of
this  Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed
by  the Buyer and the Seller. No waiver by any Party of any default, 
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether 
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent 
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or 
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or 
subsequent occurrence.   (j) Severability. If any provision of this
Agreement or the  application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be
invalid or  unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and
the  application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be  affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent
permitted by  law so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions  contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any  Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid  or unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify  this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely  as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions  contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.   (k) Expenses. Each of the Buyer and the Seller will bear its own

provided, however, that the Buyer  will pay any fees and charges of any
Governmental Entities in connection  with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any
fees to be paid to the FCC and the  Telecommunications Regulatory Board. All
use, sales, transfer and other  similar transaction Taxes imposed in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (other than
any Taxes on income or gains that  the Seller may realize (which shall be
paid by the Seller) or that the Buyer  may realize (which shall be paid by
the Buyer)) shall be paid one-half by  the Buyer and one-half by the Seller.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no  event shall the Company, pay or be

as to projections, budgets, or estimates of future results,  or as to
information in documents made available to the Buyer or its 
representatives.   (m) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly
in the  negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or
question of  intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if  drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall  arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any  of the provisions of this Agreement.   (n) Non-Recourse.
Except with respect to the guaranty attached hereto  as Exhibit D, no past,
present or future director, officer, employee,  incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or  representative of either
party hereto or any Affiliate thereof shall have  any liability for any
