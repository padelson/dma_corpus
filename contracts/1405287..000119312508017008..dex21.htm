form of _Exhibit 2.7(c)_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") the Escrow Cash
and the Escrow Units (collectively, together with interest and other income

(ii) the number of Parent Units in the Escrow Fund at such time; provided that

Closing Date and ending on the later of (i) the date that the Parents
Independent auditor issues its opinion on the Parents financial statements
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008; or (ii) the date which is
twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, but in any event not later than
eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be

a Person relative to the number of Fully Diluted Shares.

Parent an executed counterpart of the Registration Rights/Lockup Agreement a
Unit Certificate representing the portion of the Unit Consideration (other

receive hereunder. In the event that a holder of Shares or Optionholder does
not deliver to the Parent prior to the Closing Date such executed counterpart
to the Registration Rights/Lockup Agreement or any consents or releases
contemplated by _Section 2.6_ hereof, the Parent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to deliver to such holder of Shares or Optionholder cash
in lieu of any Parent Units, or portion thereof, such Person would otherwise
be entitled to hereunder. The Parent shall have the right to increase the
number of Parent Units and decrease the amount of cash delivered to H.I.G.

Shares on a Pro Rata Basis the amount of the Working Capital Holdback not paid

Stockholders Representative to the Parent. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall
receive no compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or

Company and each of the stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings.

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholders Representative while acting in good faith
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The stockholders and Optionholders of
Holdings shall severally indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold
it, its officers, directors, employees and  



 

14  agents harmless against any Losses, Liability, or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder.

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative shall constitute a decision of all the stockholders and
Optionholders of Holdings for whom Escrow Units and Escrow Cash is otherwise
issuable or payable to them are deposited in escrow and shall be final,
binding, and conclusive upon each such stockholder and Optionholders, and the
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent, or instruction of the

Closing Date, the chief financial officer of the Company shall prepare and
deliver to the Parent an estimated balance sheet and an estimated calculation
of the Closing Date Working Capital for the Company as of the Closing Date,
prepared in accordance with GAAP utilizing the same GAAP methodology and
assumptions as was used in preparing the Financial Statements (the "
_Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). If the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet shows a Working Capital Shortfall, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the aggregate amount of such Working Capital Shortfall. If the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shows a Working Capital Surplus, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the aggregate amount of such Working
Capital Surplus.

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustments_. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to prepare and deliver to
the Stockholders Representative an unaudited balance sheet for the Company
(the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a calculation of the Closing Date
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date, which shall
be prepared by the Surviving Company in accordance with GAAP utilizing the
same GAAP methodology and assumptions as was used in preparing the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet (to the extent consistent with those used in
preparing the Financial Statements). The Parent shall, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Companys
accountants to, provide the Stockholders Representative with reasonable
access to all books, records, work papers and other documents and data as was
used to prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to dispute the Closing Date Balance Sheet
(and any items therein) and the Closing Date Working Capital calculations and
make any proposed adjustments thereto as provided in _Section 2.10(c)_
hereof.

(i) If it is determined (A) there is a Working Capital Surplus based on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet less than the estimated Working Capital Surplus
calculated under _Section 2.10(a)_ (the " _Surplus Shortfall_ "), or (B)
there is a Working Capital Shortfall based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
either (I) in excess of the estimated Working Capital Shortfall calculated
under _Section 2.10(a)_ or (II) if there was an estimated Working Capital
Surplus calculated under _Section 2.10(a)_, the Stockholders Representative
shall pay to the Surviving Company on the Settlement Date from the Working
Capital Holdback either (1) the Surplus Shortfall, (2) in the case of _Section
2.10(b)(i)(B)(I)_, the excess Working Capital Shortfall, or (3) in the case
of Section 2.10(b)(i)(B)(II), the Working Capital Shortfall _plus_ any
estimated Working Capital Surplus added to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.10(a)_ hereof.



 

15 (ii) If it is determined (A) there is a Working Capital Shortfall based on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet less than the estimated Working Capital
Shortfall calculated under _Section 2.10(a)_ (the " _Shortfall Underage_ "),
or (B) there is a Working Capital Surplus based on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet either (I) in excess of the estimated Working Capital Surplus
calculated under _Section 2.10(a)_ or (II) if there was an estimated Working
Capital Shortfall calculated under _Section 2.10(a)_, the Parent shall pay
to the Stockholders Representative (to be distributed to Holdings
stockholders and the Optionholders immediately prior to the Effective Time on
a Pro Rata Basis) either (1) the Shortfall Underage, (2) in the case
of Section _2.10(b)(ii)(B)(I)_ , the excess Working Capital Surplus, or (3)
in the case of Section 2.10(b)(ii)(B)(II), the Working Capital Surplus _plus_
any estimated Working Capital Shortfall deducted from the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_ hereof.

(iii) In the event any amount due to a party under this  _Section 2.10_ is
not paid on the Settlement Date, the payor shall pay interest on such amounts
at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, which shall accrue from the Closing
Date to the date of actual payment.

All amounts paid by the Stockholders Representative to the stockholders and
Optionholders of Holdings pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be paid
on a Pro Rata Basis.

(c) _Dispute Resolution Procedures_. The Stockholders Representative
shall have until thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Closing Date
Working Capital calculation, to review such calculation and propose any
adjustments thereto. All adjustments proposed by the Stockholders
Representative shall be set out in detail in a written statement delivered to
the Parent (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") and shall be incorporated into the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, unless the Parent shall object in writing to such
proposed adjustments (the proposed adjustment or adjustments to which the
Parent objects are referred to herein as the " _Contested Adjustments_ " and
the Parents objection notice is referred to herein as the " _Contested
Adjustment Notice_ ") within ten (10) days of delivery by the Stockholders
Representative to the Parent of the Adjustment Statement. If the Parent
delivers a Contested Adjustment Notice to the Stockholders Representative,
the Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall attempt in good faith
to resolve their dispute regarding the Contested Adjustments, but if a final
resolution thereof is not obtained within ten (10) business days after the
Parent delivers to the Stockholders Representative such Contested Adjustment
Notice, either the Parent or the Stockholders Representative may retain for
the benefit of all the parties hereto Deloitte and Touche LLP, or if unable or
unwilling to serve, another nationally recognized Independent accounting firm
acceptable to both the Stockholders Representative and the Parent (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes concerning the
Contested Adjustments. If the Independent Accountant is retained, then the
Stockholders Representative and the Parent shall each submit to the
Independent Accountant in writing not later than fifteen (15) days after the
Independent Accountant is retained their respective positions with respect to
the Contested Adjustments, together with such supporting documentation as they
deem necessary or as the Independent Accountant requests. The Independent
Accountant shall not review or take into account any information that is not
submitted within the fifteen (15) day deadline and shall only make a
determination as to the Contested Adjustments and not other items on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Independent Accountants determination of the
Contested Adjustments shall not be higher than the highest amounts or lower
than the lowest amounts proposed by the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative. The Independent Accountant shall, within thirty (30) days
after receiving the positions of both the Stockholders Representative and
the Parent and all supplementary supporting documentation requested by the
Independent Accountant, but no later than sixty (60) days after being
retained, render its decision as to the Contested Adjustments, which decision
shall be final and binding on, and nonappealable by, the Stockholders
Representative and the Parent. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid by the party whose estimate of the Contested
Adjustments is furthest from the Independent Accountants calculation of the
Contested Adjustments. The decision of the Independent Accountant shall also
include a certificate of the Independent Accountant setting forth the
final Closing Date Working Capital calculation (the " _Settlement Amount
Certificate_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be deemed to include all
proposed adjustments not disputed by the Parent and those adjustments accepted
or made by the decision of the Independent Accountant in resolving the
Contested Adjustments.



 

16 (d) _Settlement_. There shall be a " _Settlement Date_ " after
the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital which shall mean the
following, as applicable:

(i) If the Stockholders Representative accepts the Closing Date Working
Capital calculation, three (3) Business Days after the Stockholders
Representative notifies the Parent.

(ii) If the Stockholders Representative has not timely delivered an
Adjustment Statement to the Parent, thirty five (35) days after the date the
Stockholders Representative receives the Closing Date Working Capital
calculation;

(iii) If the Stockholders Representative has timely delivered an Adjustment
Statement and the Parent has not timely delivered a Contested Adjustment
Notice, fifteen (15) days after the date the Parent receives the Adjustment
Statement;

(iv) If the Stockholders Representative and the Parent have any disputes
regarding Contested Adjustments and they resolve those disputes in writing,
three (3) Business Days after such resolution;

(v) Three (3) Business Days after the Independent Accountant delivers the
Settlement Amount Certificate, if applicable; or

(vi) Such other date as shall be agreed between the Stockholders
Representative and the Parent.

If the Surviving Company is owed any amount pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(i)
and such amount exceeds the amount paid by the Stockholders Representative to
the Surviving Company from the Working Capital Holdback, the Parent shall have
the right to collect such amount from the Escrow Fund. 

2.11 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
_Article X_ , and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article III_ , the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 A.M. at the offices of Wilmer Cutler

at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions,

2.12 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Holdings or the Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
Holdings or the Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger.

2.13 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Parent, the Surviving Company or any other party hereto
shall be liable for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger consideration,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares or any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such Merger consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.14 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Units or Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
Parent Units or  



 

17  shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange therefor until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate or a
lost Certificate affidavit and indemnity in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or a
lost Certificate affidavit and indemnity, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the Parent Units or certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon
the exchange of any Holdings Common Stock or Vested Options.

2.15 _Withholding Rights; Deductions from Consideration_ _._ Each of the
Surviving Company and the Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any
Taxes it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision
of state, local, or foreign Tax Law from (i) any payment to any employee of
the Company under this Agreement or any other related agreement or with
respect to the exercise or settlement of any Options, or (ii) payment to any
other Person with respect to the Merger. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted by the Surviving Company or the Parent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts (to the extent paid over to the proper
taxing authority) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made by the Surviving Company or the Parent, as the case may
be.

good and valid title, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens,
to all of the personal, tangible and intangible personal property and assets
used in its business, including, without limitation, the assets shown in
the Parent SEC Reports. None of the Permitted Liens materially interfere with
the ordinary conduct of the Parents business or materially detract from the
use, occupancy, value or marketability of title of the assets subject thereto.
None of the assets belonging to the Parent will be subject to a Contract of
sale or lease by the Parent on the Closing Date.

6.8 _Contracts and Commitments_.

(a) Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement and  _Schedule 6.8_ hereto, there are no Contracts, Liens,
license, permit, franchise, purchase orders, sales orders or other
understandings, commitments or obligations (including without limitation
outstanding offers or proposals) of any kind, whether written or oral, to
which the Parent is a party or by or to which any of the properties or assets
of the Parent may be bound, subject or affected, which either (i) creates or
imposes a Liability greater than $250,000, or (ii) may not be cancelled by
the Parent on less than thirty (30) days or less prior notice (" _Parent
Contracts_ "). All Parent Contracts are set forth on _Schedule 6.8_ hereto,
other than those that are exhibits to the Parent SEC Reports.

(b) Other than as set forth on _Schedule 6.8_ hereto, each Parent Contract was
entered into at arms length and in the ordinary course, is in full force and
effect and is valid and binding upon and enforceable against each of the
parties thereto except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights. Correct and complete copies
of all Parent material Contracts (or written summaries in the case of oral
Parent Contracts) and of all outstanding offers or proposals of the Parent for
Contracts that would be Parent material Contracts have been heretofore
delivered to the Company.

(c) Neither the Parent nor, to the Parents Knowledge, any other party thereto
is in material breach or default of, and no event has occurred which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a material breach or default
under, any Parent Contract, and no party to any Parent Contract has given any
written notice of any claim of any such breach, default or event, which,
individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Parent. Each Contract to which the Parent is a party or
by which it is bound that has not expired by its terms is in full force and
effect, except where such failure to be in full force and effect is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.

6.9 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, no employee, executive officer,
director or stockholder of the Parent or a member of his or her immediate
family has any Liability to the Parent nor does the Parent have any Liability
(or is committed to make loans or extend or guarantee credit) to any of them,
other than reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of the
Parent. To the Parents Knowledge, none of such individuals has any direct or
indirect ownership  



 

39  interest in any Person with whom the Parent is affiliated or with whom the
Parent has a material contractual relationship, or any Person that competes
with the Parent, except that each employee, stockholder, officer or director
of the Parent and members of their respective immediate families may own less
than 5% of the outstanding stock in publicly traded companies that may compete
with the Parent. To the Parents Knowledge, no officer, director or
stockholder or any member of their immediate families is, directly or
indirectly, interested in any material contract with the Parent (other than
such contracts as relate to any such individual ownership of capital stock or
other securities of the Parent).

6.10 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
the Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
to be filed with the SEC by the Parent in connection with the Merger, or any
of the amendments or supplements thereto (as defined below) will, at the
time such documents are filed with the SEC, or at any time they are amended
or supplemented, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. Such documents will each comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

6.11 _Proceedings_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports, or as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect, there are no Proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent or the Merger
Subsidiary, or any of their assets and to the Parents Knowledge, there is no
basis for any Proceeding against the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary or any
of its assets. The Parent or the Merger Subsidiary is not subject to any
Order of any Governmental Agency.

6.12 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.12_ hereto,

respects, with all applicable Laws and Orders. No written notice has been
received by the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary alleging a violation of, or
Liability or potential responsibility under, any such Law or Order. To the
Parents Knowledge, since its incorporation, there has been no change in any
applicable Laws that would have a Material Adverse Effect and there is no
impending change in any applicable Laws that would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

6.13 _Environmental Matters_. The Parent has complied in all material
respects with all applicable Environmental Laws. The Parent has not received
any written notice, demand, letter, claim or request for information alleging

arrangements with any Governmental Agency or subject to any indemnity or other
agreement with any third party relating to Liability under any Environmental
Law.

any right, title or interest in any material Proprietary Rights.

6.15 _Brokerage_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.15_, there are

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any
Contract made by or on behalf of the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary.

6.16 _American Stock Exchange Quotation_. The Parent Units are quoted on the
AMEX. There is no action or Proceeding pending or, to the Parents Knowledge,
threatened against the Parent by AMEX or NASD with respect to any intention by
such entities to prohibit or terminate the quotation of the Parent Units on
the AMEX. The Parent has not received notice from the AMEX to the effect that
the Parent is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements
of the AMEX. The Parent is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in
the foreseeable future continue to be, in compliance with all such listing
and maintenance requirements.

6.17 _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Parent Units are registered
pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the Parent has taken no
action designed to, or which is likely to have the effect of, terminating the
registration of the Parent Units under the Exchange Act nor has the Parent
received any notification that the SEC is contemplating terminating such
registration.

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and demands,
contemporaneous with such vote, that Parent convert such stockholders IPO
Shares into a Conversion Payment pursuant to the Parent Charter.

than February 12, 2008, the Parent shall, with the cooperation of the Company,
prepare and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and with all other
applicable regulatory bodies, a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
in preliminary form provided that if the Parent is otherwise ready, willing
and able to file the Proxy Statement but is delayed in doing so solely by the
Companys failure (whether or not in the Companys control) to provide the
Companys financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2007, the
filing date shall be extended (x) one (1) Business Day for each day that the
Company is the sole cause of such delay _plus_ (y) three (3) Business Days.
The Proxy Statement shall:

(i) Request approval from the Parents stockholders of the Merger and this
Agreement upon the terms set forth herein and the issuance of the Parent
Units;

(ii) Include the Parents Board of Directors recommendation to vote for the
Merger, subject to Section 8.1(e); and



 

42 (iii) Request such other approvals as the parties may determine are necessary
or desirable. The Parent shall also take any action required to be taken
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
the Unit Consideration.

The Proxy Statement shall be filed in preliminary form in accordance with the
Exchange Act, and each of Company and the Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (1) prepare and file with the SEC the definitive Proxy
Statement, (2) cause the definitive Proxy Statement, including any amendment
or supplement thereto to be approved by the SEC, and (3) to cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Parents stockholders as

proxy on file with the SEC); provided, that if the Company has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the 2007 Financial Statements, the
Companys failure to meet either such deadline shall only result in the
deferral of the dates set forth in the definition of "Purchase Price" and
_Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 10.1(d)_. The Stockholders
Representative shall make itself available to the Parent and its counsel in

timely manner to comments from the SEC. Prior to the filing of the Proxy
Statement with the SEC and each amendment thereto, at the Parents request,

SEC, take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a special meeting of its stockholders in accordance with all applicable Law
and the Parent Charter and by-laws (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") as
soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The
Parent shall consult with the Company on the date for the Parent Stockholders
Meeting. The Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Parents stockholders as soon as
practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared but in any event, the Parent
shall mail the Proxy Statement within three (3) business days after the SEC
clears the Proxy Statement. The Parent shall, through its board of directors,
recommend to its stockholders that they approve the Merger, this Agreement,
and the transactions contemplated herein, unless the Parents board of

counsel, that the fiduciary duties of the board of directors under applicable
law prohibit it from doing so, in which event the Company shall have the
rights set forth in _Section 10.1_ hereof.

(f) The Parent shall comply with all applicable federal and state securities
laws in all material respects with respect to the filing of the Proxy
Statement and the issuance of the Unit Consideration.

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the Parent Units issued to the
stockholders of Holdings and Optionholders pursuant to this Agreement are
intended to be issued pursuant to the "private placement" exemption from
registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act and agree to fully cooperate with Parent
in its efforts to ensure that the Parent Units may be issued pursuant to such
private placement exemption. Such Parent Units shall be subject to a
Registration Rights/Lockup Agreement; provided that in the event that Parent,
based on written advice of its counsel, has determined that the Parent
Units to be issued pursuant to this Agreement cannot be issued under the
"private placement" exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, then
the Parent shall take all legally permissible action necessary to prepare and
file, on a timely basis, a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC
which registers the issuance of the shares issued as Unit Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Form S-4 Alternative_"). Parent shall
use, and shall cause its officers, employees, agents, advisors or other
representatives to use, their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
effectuate the foregoing (and fully cooperate with the other parties),
including, without limitation, preparing and filing all applications,
documents and forms necessary to register the Parent Units on an effective
registration statement on Form S-4. In the event that Parent Units are issued
pursuant to the Form S-4 Alternative, no Parent Units (or certificates
therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificates to any person who,
prior to the Effective Time, may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in
Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company until such person has
delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed affiliate agreement in the
form provided by Parent.

8.2 _Access to Information: Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each party shall afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of the other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to such of its properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees as the other party may
reasonably require to obtain SEC approval of the Proxy Statement; provided
that prior to the Closing, neither the Parent nor any of its officers,
directors, Affiliates, or agents shall contact the Companys customers or
employees (other than Toni Portmann and Tom Andrus) without the prior written
consent of the Company.

 

(b) Any confidentiality agreement previously executed by the parties shall be
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement. Each party
agrees to maintain in confidence any non-public information received from the
other party, and to use such non-public information only for purposes of  



 

44  consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
confidentiality obligations will not apply to: (i) information which was known
to the one party or its agents prior to receipt from the other party; (ii)
information which is or becomes generally known to the public without the
breach of any duty or obligation to the party asserting the confidential
nature of such information; (iii) information acquired by a party or its
agents from a third party who was not bound to an obligation of
confidentiality; and (iv) disclosure required by Law or AMEX; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that while any such disclosure will not be a breach of this
Agreement, the disclosed information shall continue to be confidential
information for purposes of this Agreement unless one of the other exceptions
noted above is applicable. The Company and the Parent may disclose such non-
public information to advisors retained by either the Company or the Parent,
provided that any party to whom such information is disclosed shall be bound
by confidentiality obligations as least as restrictive as those set forth
herein, which obligations shall be directly enforceable by the Company or the
Parent, as appropriate, either as a party to such arrangements or as a third
party beneficiary thereunder, and shall be specifically advised that the
federal securities laws in the United States prohibit trading in securities
of an issuer when in possession of material non-public information relating to
such issuer. In the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in _Article
X_ hereof, each party (A) will return or cause to be returned to the other
all documents and other material obtained from the other in connection with
the Merger contemplated hereby, and (B) will use its reasonable best efforts
to delete from its computer systems all documents and other material obtained
from the other in connection with the Merger contemplated hereby. In the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, the Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates, employees, representatives and agents not to, use
any information obtained by it or its representatives, agents, lenders and
investors about the Company to, and the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary
otherwise shall not (A) contact, solicit or employ any current employees of
the Company identified to them by the Company (whether or not previously known
by the Parent) for a period of eighteen (18) months following the termination
of this Agreement, provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
contact, solicitation or employment of such employees pursuant to any general
public solicitation not directed specifically to such employees, (B) attempt
to induce the Companys clients or customers identified to them by the Company
to reduce their business or services obtained from, or provided to, the
Company, in any case, for the longer of six (6) months following the
termination of this Agreement or twelve (12) months from the date hereof, or
(c) disparage the Company, its senior management or its Affiliates, for a
period of twelve (12) months from the date this Agreement is terminated.

8.3  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare and file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Agency in order to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each party
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to
satisfy the conditions to the Closing set forth herein and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

8.4 _HSR Act_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
but no later than ten (10) days after the date hereof, the Parent and the
Company shall each prepare and file the notification required of it under the
HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall promptly and in good faith respond to all information requested of it
by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice in connection with
such notification and otherwise cooperate in good faith with each other and
such Governmental Agencies. The Parent and the Company shall (a)
promptly inform the other of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Agency
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) give the other
prompt notice of the commencement of any Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Agency with respect to such transactions and (c) keep the other
reasonably informed as to the status of any such Proceeding. Filing fees with
respect to the notifications required under the HSR Act shall be paid by the
Parent; provided that if the Closing occurs, the Company Transaction Fees
shall be increased by one-half of such filing fees.

notice to the Parent, and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, to the extent that either

8.6 _Public Announcements and Investor Presentations_. The Parent and the
Company shall jointly develop and approve all press releases and other public
statements and communications (including investor presentations and call
transcripts and any other communications that would require a filing under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act) with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon the form and
content of any such press release, public statement or communication by the
Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or the Company, with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent
required by applicable Law or AMEX neither the Parent nor the Company shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure

materials related to this Agreement to Persons directly involved in public
equity investing (including research analysts). The Parent shall also be
permitted to issue a press release mutually agreeable to the Parent and the
Company regarding the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement through a public distribution outlet, such as PR News Wire.
All other distributions and distribution lists shall require the Companys
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Each of the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary and the
Company shall pay any sales, use, ad valorem, property, transfer (including

the notice attached as Exhibit A to the Trust Agreement.

8.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Parent agrees to provide any required notice under WARN and any other
applicable Law and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or any similar
triggering event under any other applicable Law occurring on or after the
Closing or arising as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, except as provided in the definition of Company Transaction Fees,
the Parent further agrees to be solely responsible for all terminations and
severance benefits, costs, charges and liabilities of any nature incurred with

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Holdings shall submit to a stockholder vote the
right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment received by such "disqualified individual" would be an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code), in a manner that satisfies
the stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to the payment or other compensation. In
addition, before the vote is submitted to stockholders, Holdings shall provide
adequate disclosure to the stockholders of Holdings of all material facts
concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "excess
parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the
Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Parent shall have the right to review
and comment on all documents to be delivered to Holdings stockholders in

comments if in the opinion of its outside counsel such disclosure is not
reasonably necessary to comply with the disclosure requirements of this
_Section 8.10(b)_.

8.11 _Assumption of Company Indebtedness_. The Parent acknowledges that at the
Closing Date, the Company will have outstanding the Closing Indebtedness set
forth on _Schedule 8.11(a)_ hereto. The Parent agrees that the Surviving
Company may assume such Closing Indebtedness on its existing terms and
conditions, except that the guaranty of H.I.G. Capital Partners III L.P shall
terminate. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall not seek or incur any
Indebtedness other than the Closing Indebtedness, provided that to the extent
that the Surviving Company does not assume such Closing Indebtedness, the
Parent may seek post-closing financing of not more than $100,000,000 from the
Persons set forth on _Schedule 8.11(b)_ hereto. In the event that the Parent
elects not to procure financing from the Persons set forth on _Schedule
8.11(b)_ , the Parent shall have the right to seek other financing not to
exceed $100,000,000 in principal amount if it first obtains the written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Prior to the Closing, without the Companys consent, the Parent agrees not to
seek to amend or modify the terms or conditions of any such Closing
Indebtedness without the Companys designee being present at any meeting at
which such amendment or modification is discussed. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to be present at any meeting at which the
Parent is seeking to discuss the Closing Indebtedness with the lenders of
such Indebtedness. The Parent agrees to cause the guaranty of H.I.G. Capital
Partners III L.P. to terminate on the Closing Date.



 

47 8.12 _Schedules Bring Down_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement and all information delivered in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relating to the Companys representations and warranties, or any schedule
hereto or in the certificates delivered by the Company to the Parent and/or
the Merger Subsidiary pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof shall be true
and correct on the Closing Date as though then made and as though the Closing
Date was substituted for the date to which such representations and warranties
relate throughout such representations and warranties; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company Disclosure Schedules relating to the Companys
representations and warranties delivered to the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary as of the date hereof (other than as to Sections 5.1 through 5.3
and 5.17(c)) shall be permitted to be revised and amended as of the Closing
Date to reflect events and circumstances occurring after the date that is 90
days after the date hereof pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section
8.12(c)_ below.

(b) The representations and warranties of the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary
contained in this Agreement and all information delivered in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule relating to the Parents and the Merger Subsidiarys
representations and warranties, or any schedule hereto or in the certificates
delivered by Parent to the Company pursuant to _Section 3.3_ hereof shall be
true and correct on the Closing Date as though then made and as though the
Closing Date was substituted for the date of this Agreement throughout such
representations and warranties; _provided, however,_ that the
Parent Disclosure Schedule relating to the Parents and the Merger
Subsidiarys representations and warranties delivered to the Company as of the
date hereof (other than as to Sections 6.1 through 6.3) shall be permitted to
be revised and amended as of the Closing Date to reflect events and
circumstances occurring after the date that is 90 days after the date hereof
pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 8.12(c)_ below.

(c) The Parent and the Company agree to provide each other with any revised
and amended Company Disclosure Schedules relating to the Companys
representations and warranties or Parent Disclosure Schedules relating to the
Parents and the Merger Subsidiarys representations and warranties, as the
case may be, pursuant to this _Section 8.12(c)_ no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date or as mutually agreed upon by the
Parent and the Company. If the revision or amendment to the Company Disclosure
Schedules relating to the Companys representations and warranties reflects
events or circumstances that occurred (i) prior to or within ninety (90) days
from the date hereof, or (ii) after ninety (90) days from the date hereof and
outside the ordinary course of business of the Company, the Parent shall be
entitled to indemnification for such events or circumstances notwithstanding
the disclosure thereof, but the corresponding representation and warranty
shall be deemed to be correct for purposes of _Section 3.3 (a)(i)_. If the
revision or amendment to such Company Disclosure Schedules reflects events or
circumstances that occurred after ninety (90) days from the date hereof in the
ordinary course of business of the Company, the representation and warranty
shall be modified thereby for purposes of indemnification and for purposes of
_Section 3.3 (a)(i)_. If the revision or amendment to the Parent Disclosure
Schedules relating to the Parents or the Merger Subsidiarys representations
and warranties reflects events or circumstances that occurred (i) prior to or
within ninety (90) days from the date hereof, or (ii) after ninety (90) days
from the date hereof and outside the ordinary course of business of
the Parent, the Company shall be entitled to indemnification for such events
or circumstances notwithstanding the disclosure thereof, but the corresponding
representation and warranty shall be deemed to be correct for purposes of
_Section 3.2 (a)(i)_. If the revision or amendment to such Parent Disclosure
Schedules reflects events or circumstances that occurred after ninety (90)
days from the date hereof in the ordinary course of business of the Parent,
the representation and warranty shall be modified thereby for purposes of
indemnification and for purposes of _Section 3.2 (a)(i)_. In the event that a
party revises or amends the Company Disclosure Schedules or Parent Disclosure
Schedules, as the case may be, pursuant to this _Section 8.12(c)_, the other
party shall have the right until the earlier of (A) twenty (20) Business Days
from the date that the disclosing party provides in writing the information
reasonably available to it pertaining to the events and circumstances set
forth on the amended or revised Company Disclosure Schedules or Parent
Disclosure Schedules, as the case may be, or (B) the Closing Date, to
terminate this Agreement on the basis that the amended or revised Company
Disclosure Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules, as the case may be,
disclose events or circumstances that constitute a Material  



 

48  Adverse Effect. For purposes of this _Section 8.12(c)_, in determining
whether an amended Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule discloses a breach of a representation or warranty that would have a
Material Adverse Effect the parties shall calculate the effect on the Company
or the Parent from the first dollar of Losses incurred in connection
therewith. If the party to which such amended or revised Company Disclosure
Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules have been delivered does not
terminate this Agreement within such time period, the events and circumstances
set forth on the revised schedules shall, in and of themselves, be deemed not
to constitute a Material Adverse Effect for purposes of _Sections 3.2(a_ ),
_3.3(a)_ and _10.4_ and such party shall not later have the right to terminate
this Agreement or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder
solely on the basis thereof. If the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.12(c)_ and the Parents obligation to pay a break-up fee
pursuant to _Section 10.4_ hereof would otherwise have previously existed,
then Parent shall pay such break-up fee. If the Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.12(c_) and the Parent is not otherwise
then obligated to pay the break up fee, then no break up fee shall be due and
payable hereunder. For purposes of this _Section 8.12(c)_ and _Article XI_ ,
" _ordinary course of business_ " means any event or circumstance that occurs
in the ordinary course of the Companys or Parents, as the case may be,
business, consistent with past practices and which occurs with a similar
frequency and in a similar amount as other reasonably similar occurrences or
circumstances.

8.13 _Exclusivity_.

(a) Prior to July 31, 2008, the Company shall not, and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its officers, directors,
Affiliates, employees, representatives and agents not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate or solicit any inquiry, proposal, offer or
discussion with any Person (other than the Parent) concerning any merger,

liquidation, dissolution, share exchange, sale of stock, sale of material
assets or similar business transaction involving the Company or any division
of the Company (an " _Alternative Transaction_ "), (ii) furnish any non-public
information concerning the Business, properties or assets of the Company or
any division of the Company to any Person (other than to the Parent or in the
ordinary course of business), or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations
with any party (other than the Parent) concerning any such transaction. The
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, prior to the termination of this
Agreement, (A) enter into any binding agreement relating to any Alternative
Transaction, or (B) furnish any non-public information concerning the
Business, properties or assets of the Company or any division of the Company

negotiations of the nature described in _Section 8.13(a)_ hereof above were
pending prior to the date hereof that the Company is terminating such

requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article XI_
). The Company acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing,
subject to Section 4.5, the Parent will be entitled to possession of all
documents, books, records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial
data of any sort relating to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
Closing, the Parent shall provide to the Stockholders Representative

(including Tax records), agreements, and financial data where the
Stockholders Representative has a legitimate purpose, including without
limitation, in the event of an Internal Revenue Service audit and subject
to the execution of a customary confidentiality agreement.

rights, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to, or make any claim of
any kind against, monies held in the Trust Fund, regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to,
the business relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and the
Parent, on the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other
matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort,
equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to in this _Section 10.3_ as the " _Trust Claims_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
hereby irrevocably waives any Trust Claim it may have, now or in the future
(in each case, however, prior to the consummation of a business combination),
and will not seek recourse against, the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever
in respect thereof. In the event that the Company or any of its Affiliates
commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to
or arising out of any matter relating to the Parent, which proceeding seeks,
in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Fund or the public stockholders
of Parent for money damages, the Parent shall be entitled to recover from the
Company the associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such
action, in the event Parent prevails in such action or proceeding.

10.4 _Fees and Expenses_. Each party shall bear its own expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if the Closing occurs, the Parent shall fund
the Company SEC Fees and the Company Transaction Fees shall be reduced
accordingly, and (b) if, and only if, either (A) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10.1(c)(iii) (c)(v)_ , _(c)(vi)_ or _(d)_
hereof and the Company has not been previously notified in writing that it is
in material breach of this Agreement or has not suffered a Material Adverse
Effect, or (B) the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Sections
10.1(f)_ or _10.1(e)(iii)_ hereof, the Parent shall pay the Company an
aggregate break-up fee of $3,500,000 consisting of (i) $1,000,000 within five
(5) days of such termination (except as set forth in _Section 10.1(f)_
hereof), and (ii) $2,500,000 upon the occurrence of a Parent Alternative
Transaction, if any.



 

51 ARTICLE XI

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF AGREEMENT

11.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Other than the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.13_ and _6.13_
(Environmental) and _5.14_ (Taxes) hereof, which shall survive for their
respective statutory period, and _Sections 6.1_ and  _7.1_ (Organization),
_6.2_ and _7.2_ (Authorization), and _6.3_ (Capitalization) hereof which shall
survive indefinitely, all of the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue
in full force and effect until the later of (i) the date that the Parents
independent auditor issues its opinion on the Parents financial statements
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008; or (ii) the date which is
twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, but in any event not later than
eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement (" _Survival Period_ ").
In order for a notice to be properly given within the Survival Period, the
notice must state in reasonable detail the indemnification claim, the
representation, warranty or covenant breached thereby, the actual Losses
resulting, or reasonably expected to result, therefrom and such
other information as reasonably necessary for a Person to qualify and
quantify the alleged indemnifiable Loss, in each case to the extent reasonably
available to the Person delivering such notice.

11.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Parent_. In the event that
the Merger closes and the Company misrepresents or breaches any of its
representations, warranties (as of the Closing Date) or covenants contained in
this Agreement or in the certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_
hereof or the Parent incurs any Losses as a result of or in connection with
the Retained Litigation, the India Earnout Payments or the Severance Payments,
and the Parent makes a written claim for indemnification against the Company
within the applicable Survival Period or, with respect to the Retained
Litigation, the India Earnout Payments or the Severance Payments, within 60
days of the final settlement thereof, then the Parent shall be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Fund all actual Losses (for
the avoidance of doubt, Losses shall not include Taxes incurred in a taxable
period ending after the Closing Date due to a reduction in losses (generated
during a Pre-Closing Period)) that the Parent or its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Surviving Company) may suffer
through and after the date of the claim for indemnification resulting from,
arising out of, or relating to, such misrepresentation or breach or the
Retained Litigation, India Earnout Payments or Severance Payments; provided
that the Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification until such time as
such aggregate Losses exceed $500,000 (other than for breaches of _Section
5.17(c)_ hereof or with respect to the Retained Litigation, the India Earnout
Payments or the Severance Payments), at which point the Parent shall be
indemnified for all Losses. In addition, the Parent shall be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Fund all Company Transaction
Fees not paid at the Closing with a corresponding reduction in the Purchase
Price. Except in the event of fraud by the Company, after the Closing the
Parents, the Merger Subsidiarys and the Surviving Companys sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach by the Company of its representations,
warranties and covenants shall be indemnification out of the Escrow Fund
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary agree that its Losses shall be net of the reserves on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet that are in the same or similar Closing Date Balance Sheet
category as such Losses (provided that Losses as a result of or in connection
with the Retained Litigation, the Severance Payments and the India Earnout
Payments shall only be net of the reserves on the Closing Date Balance Sheet
for such Retained Litigation, Severance Payments, or India Earnout Payments,
as applicable, and then only if there is a Working Capital Shortfall or
Working Capital Surplus), and in addition, with respect to Taxes, Losses shall
not include any Taxes that result from transactions or actions taken by the
Parent or the Company outside of the ordinary course of business after the
Closing (including but not limited to a reduction in losses (generated during
a Pre-Closing Period) caused by any action of the Parent, the Company or
their Affiliates after Closing). In addition, Losses that are the subject of
an adjustment to the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not be indemnifiable
hereunder to the extent the event or circumstance that would otherwise
constitute a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant has been
previously settled by the Independent Accountant or the parties. The parties
hereto agree that (i) the Escrow Fund is a negotiated limitation on the
Parents and the Merger Subsidiarys remedies for any and all damages
(including liabilities under  



 

52   _Section 12.6_ hereof) other than actual fraud, (ii) absent fraud of such
stockholder or Optionholder, the stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings
shall have no liability to Parent or Merger Subsidiary for any Losses of any
kind or nature (including liabilities under _Section 12.6_ hereof) in excess
of the Escrow Fund, and (iii) this limitation is a material inducement to the
stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings to approve this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Losses relating to an indemnification claim to the extent feasible.

(b) _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Stockholders_. In the event
that the Merger closes and the Parent or Merger Subsidiary misrepresents or
breaches any of its representations, warranties (as of the Closing Date) or
covenants contained in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ hereof and the Stockholder Representative makes
a written claim for indemnification against the Parent within the applicable
Survival Period, then the stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") shall
be entitled to recover from the Parent all actual Losses that the Company
Indemnitees may suffer through and after the date of the claim of
indemnification resulting from, arising out of, or relating to
such misrepresentation or breach; provided that the Company Indemnitees shall
not be entitled to indemnification until such time as their aggregate Losses
exceed $500,000, at which point the Company Indemnitees shall be indemnified
for all Losses up to the extent of the value of the Escrow Fund. The parties
hereto agree that (i) the foregoing is a negotiated limitation on the
stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings remedies for any and all damages
other than actual fraud, (ii) absent fraud of the Parent or the Merger
Subsidiary, the Parent shall have no liability to the stockholders and
Optionholders of Holdings for any Losses of any kind or nature in excess of
the value of the Escrow Fund, and (iii) this limitation is a material
inducement to the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary to enter into this
Agreement.

(c)  _Calculation of Losses_. No recovery for indemnification shall include
recovery for special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages unless
required by a Governmental Agency to be paid to a third party or paid to a
third party as part of a settlement approved by an Indemnitor. All claims for
indemnification shall be subject to reduction or offset for (i) any tax
benefits actually realized by the Surviving Company or the Parent on or before
the one-year anniversary from the date of the claim as a result of the
events, the incurrence of liability, or payment, giving rise to such claim
(and, to the extent the Parents recovery for such claim from the Escrow Fund
was not reduced by any tax benefit and such tax benefit is actually realized
within such one-year period but after such recovery, the Parent shall pay the
amount of such tax benefit to the Escrow Agent or the Stockholders
Representative if the Escrow Agreement has terminated), and (ii)
any insurance proceeds applicable to such claim that are actually received by
the Surviving Company or the Parent (net of the reasonable legal fees and
expenses incurred to recover the proceeds of such claim). The Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any insurance
policy applicable to an indemnification claim. This _Section 11.2(b)_ shall
apply to liabilities under _Section 12.6_.

11.3 _Third Party Claims_.

(a) _Notice_. The following procedures shall be applicable with respect to
indemnification for third party claims (other than claims for Taxes, which is
covered by _Section 12.2_ hereof). Promptly after receipt by the party
seeking indemnification or a right of recovery hereunder (hereinafter referred
to as the " _Indemnitee_ ") of notice of the commencement of any action or the
assertion of any claim, Liability or obligation by a third party (whether by
Proceeding or otherwise), against which claim, Liability or obligation the
other party to this Agreement or the Stockholders Representative, in the case
of the Company, (hereinafter the " _Indemnitor_ ") is, or may be, required
under this Agreement to indemnify such Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall, if a
claim thereon is to be, or may be, made against the Indemnitor, notify the
Indemnitor in writing of the commencement or assertion thereof and give the
Indemnitor a copy of such claim, process and all legal pleadings, provided
that no delay in notifying the Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor
thereby is prejudiced. The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in
the defense of such action with counsel with a national reputation and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee and assume the defense of such action;
provided that, (i) the Indemnitor may not assume the defense of a third-party
claim involving criminal liability or in which only equitable relief is sought
against the Indemnitee and (ii) if the Indemnitor does not agree in writing
that the  



 

53  Losses resulting from such action are indemnifiable pursuant to this Article
XI, the Indemnitee shall have the right to jointly defend such action and
the Indemnitor shall pay the Indemnitees reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses regardless of whether the Losses resulting from such action are
indemnifiable. In connection with the engagement of counsel or other experts
for the Retained Litigation, the Stockholders Representative shall obtain
the express written acknowledgement of such counsel and other experts that
they will be paid solely from disbursements that the Parent receives from the
Escrow Fund in respect of Claims therefore, and that they will not seek to
collect any of their fees or expenses from the Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

(b) _Defense_. The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in the
defense of any third party claims. In the event that the Indemnitor assumes or
participates in the defense of such third party claim as provided herein,
the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor all relevant records
and take such other action and sign such documents as are reasonably necessary
to defend such third party claim in a timely manner. If the Indemnitee shall
be required by judgment or a settlement agreement to pay any amount in
respect of any obligation or Liability against which the Indemnitor has agreed
to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement, the Indemnitor, or the
Escrow Fund (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment plus all reasonable expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with such obligation or Liability subject to this _Article XI_. No
Indemnitor, in the defense of any such claim, shall, except with the consent
of the Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all
Liability with respect to such claim. In the event that the Indemnitor does
not accept the defense of any matter for which it is entitled to assume as
provided above, the Indemnitee shall have the full right to defend such
claim.

(c) _Consent_. Prior to paying or settling any claim against which an
Indemnitor is, or may be, obligated under this Agreement to indemnify an
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee must first supply the Indemnitor with a copy of a
final court judgment or decree holding the Indemnitee liable on such claim
or failing such judgment or decree, must first receive the written approval
of the terms and conditions of such settlement from the Indemnitor, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) _Separate Counsel_. An Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own
counsel in any case and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have
been authorized in writing by the Indemnitor in connection with the defense of
such claim; (ii) the Indemnitor shall not have employed counsel in the
defense of such claim after fifteen (15) days written notice; or (iii) in the
written opinion of such Indemnitees counsel there is a legal conflict in one
counsel representing both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee; in any of the
foregoing events such reasonable fees and expenses shall be borne by the
Indemnitor.

ARTICLE XII

TAX MATTERS

12.1 _Preparation and Filing of Returns_.

After the Closing, for any taxable period of the Company that begins on or
before the Closing Date, the Parent shall timely prepare and file with the
appropriate taxing authority, all Returns required to be filed by the Company,
which returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice. As
long as there is a positive balance in the Escrow Fund, not less than forty-
five (45) days prior to the due date of such Returns, the Parent will provide
the Stockholders Representative with a draft form of the Return (the " _Draft
Return_ "). The Stockholders Representative will have the right to review
the Draft Return and any working papers relating to its preparation and to
suggest changes to such Draft Return no later than twenty-five (25) days prior
to the due date of such Return. The Parent shall incorporate any changes
suggested by the Stockholders Representative except for changes for which
Parent provides written notification to Stockholders Representative, no later
than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Returns, that it
disagrees with the changes suggested by the Stockholders Representative ("
_Disagreed_  



 

54   _Changes_ "). Parent and Stockholders Representative shall attempt to
resolve the Disagreed Changes in good faith, but to the extent they
are unable to reach a resolution, such matter shall be resolved by a mutually
agreed upon independent third-party accountant. Such third-party accountant
shall base it determination, to the extent possible, on the past practices of
the Company. The costs of such accountant shall be split equally by the
parties.

12.2 _Controversies_.

(a) As long as there is a positive balance in the Escrow Fund, the
Stockholders Representative shall, at its own expense, have the exclusive
authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority,
initiate any claim for refund, amend any Return, and contest, resolve and
defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability of the Company
for any Taxes for which the stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings are
liable under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholders
Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue
that materially affects or may materially affect the Tax liability of the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable year or other taxable period
ending after the Closing Date or the portion of the Overlap Period beginning
after the Closing Date.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 12.2(a)_, the Parent shall have the
exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing
authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Return, and contest,
resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax
deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability of
the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that neither the
Parent nor its duly appointed representative(s) shall, without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, enter into any settlement
of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects or may affect
the Tax liability for which the Stockholders Representative is liable under
this Agreement.

12.3 _Notification_.

The Parent, the Company and their Affiliates shall promptly forward to the
Stockholders Representative all written notifications and other
communications from any taxing authority received by the Company relating to
any Tax audit or other proceeding relating to the Tax liability of the
Company for which the stockholders and Optionholders of Holdings are liable
under this Agreement. The failure of the Parent to give the Stockholders
Representative such written notice shall not excuse the Stockholder
Representative of its obligations under _Section 12.6_ hereof with respect to
any increased Tax liability directly or indirectly attributable to any such
written notification or other communication unless (and only then solely to
the extent) the Stockholders Representative is prejudiced thereby.

12.4 _Amended Returns._

As long as there is a positive balance in the Escrow Fund, the Stockholders
Representative may, at its own expense cause the Company to, amend any Return
filed or required to be filed for any taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholders
Representative shall not amend any such Return that materially and adversely
affects or may materially and adversely affect the Tax liability of the
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the foregoing for any period ending
after the Closing Date, including the portion of the Overlap Period ending
after the Closing Date, without the prior consent of the Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In addition, if the
Parent disagrees with the position being taken on such amended Return, Parent
and Stockholders Representative shall attempt to resolve such disagreement
in good faith, but to the extent they are unable to reach a resolution, such
matter shall be resolved by a mutually agreed upon independent third-party
accountant. Such third-party accountant shall base it determination
on whether the position being taken on the amended Return has at least a
more-likely-than-not chance of success. The costs of such accountant shall be
split equally by the parties.

12.5 _Apportionment of Taxes_.

All Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the income, property or
operations of the Company that relate to the Overlap Period shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Period and the period after the Closing as
 



 

55  follows: (i) in the case of Taxes other than income, sales and use and
withholding Taxes, on a per diem basis, and (ii) in the case of income, sales
and use and withholding Taxes, as determined from the books and records of the
Company as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of
business on the Closing Date (provided, however, that any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall
be allocated pro rata per day between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period beginning the day after the Closing Date). The Parent and the
Stockholders Representative agree to the extent permitted by applicable Law
to elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Company.

12.6 _Indemnification for Taxes_.

The Parent shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund for all Taxes of
the Company for any Pre-Closing Period, except to the extent that (i) the
aggregate amount of such Taxes does not exceed the accruals and reserves for
Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, or (ii) such Taxes result from transactions or
actions taken by the Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries outside of the
ordinary course of business after the Closing (including but not limited to a
reduction in losses (generated during a Pre-Closing Period) caused by any
action of the Parent, the Company or their Affiliates after the Closing).

12.7 _Refunds._

Any Tax refund (other than as a result of a carryback described in Section
12.8) or settlement (including any interest in respect thereof) received by
the Parent or the Company, and any amounts of overpayments of Tax credited
against Tax that the Parent or the Company otherwise would be or would have
been required to pay that relate to any Pre-Closing Period, in each case only
if not set forth as an asset in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall be for
the account of the Stockholders Representative, and the Parent shall pay
over to the Stockholders Representative any such refund or settlement or the
amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto.

12.8 _Carrybacks_.

Any refund arising from the carryback of any net operating loss or other item
or attribute arising in a taxable year after the Closing Date to a taxable
year ending on or before the Closing Date of the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall be for the account of the Parent.

12.9 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_.

The Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to provide the Stockholders
Representative with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by
the Stockholders Representative in connection with the preparation of any
Return, any audit, or any judicial or administrative proceeding or
determination relating to liability for Taxes of the Company, including but
not limited to, access to the books and records of the Company and the
Affiliates of the Surviving Company. The Parent shall cause the Company to,
retain all Returns, schedules, work papers and all material records or other
documents relating to Taxes of the Company for the first taxable year or
other taxable period ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable
years or other taxable periods until the later of (a) seven (7) years after
the later of filing or the due date of the Return or (b) the expiration of
all applicable statutes of limitation, and provide the Stockholders
Representative with any record or information (including making employees
available to such other party for reasonable periods of time) that may
be relevant to such Return, audit, proceeding or determination.

12.10 _Section 338 Election_.

If the Parent makes an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to
the purchase of the shares of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, the Parent shall indemnify and hold the stockholders of
Holdings and Optionholders harmless for any increase in Holdings stockholder
or Optionholders liability for Taxes that result. Any Taxes resulting from
any such election shall not be treated as Taxes incurred in a Pre-Closing
Period for purposes of this Agreement.



 

56 12.11 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_.

The Parent and the Stockholders Representative agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to _Article XI_ hereof or  _Section 12.6_ hereof as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income
Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
