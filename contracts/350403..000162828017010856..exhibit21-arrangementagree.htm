The Canadian Purchaser shall promptly notify the Corporation and the
International Purchaser of any material breach by it, or to its knowledge, by
any of the Canadian Purchaser's Bank Lender or the Canadian Purchaser's
Subordinated Lender or termination of any, of the Financing Commitments. In
the event the Canadian Purchaser believes in good faith that any portion of

Canadian Purchaser shall promptly notify the Corporation and the International
Purchaser thereof and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to arrange
to obtain additional and/or alternative debt or equity financing from
additional and/or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate

other reasonably required information regarding the Corporation, any of its
Subsidiaries or any combination thereof, and (ii) using its commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral in connection with
the Financing (subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time); provided,
however, that (i) such requested cooperation or Financing does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) such requested cooperation or Financing is not, in the
opinion of the Corporation or the Corporation's counsel, acting reasonably,
prejudicial to the Corporation Shareholders, the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) such requested cooperation or Financing shall not impede,
delay or prevent the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
Article 6, (iv) such requested cooperation or Financing shall not impede,
delay or prevent the consummation of the Arrangement, (v) such requested

approval of the Corporation Shareholders, (vi) such requested cooperation or
Financing complies with all Laws and the Corporation's Constating Documents

direct or indirect costs and liabilities, fees, damages, penalties and Taxes
that may be incurred as a consequence of such requested cooperation or
Financing, including reasonable out-of-pocket costs and reasonable expenses
for external counsel and auditors which may be incurred, (viii) such requested
cooperation or Financing does not require the directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries to take any action in any
capacity other than as a director, officer, employee or agent, and (ix) no
such requested cooperation or Financing shall be considered to constitute a
breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Corporation
hereunder.

The obligation of the Canadian Purchaser to reimburse the Corporation for fees
and expenses and be responsible for costs as set out in this Section 4.6 will
be in addition to any other payment the Canadian Purchaser may be obligated to
make hereunder and will survive the termination of this Agreement. If the
Canadian Purchaser does not complete the Arrangement for any reason, and
without prejudice to any other remedy of the Corporation, the Canadian
Purchaser shall indemnify the Corporation for all losses and reasonable costs
and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any requested cooperation or Financing.

co-operate with the Purchasers and their advisors in order to determine the
manner in which any such Additional Reorganizations might most effectively be
undertaken; and (iv) co-operate with the Purchasers and their advisors to seek

Additional Reorganization: (A) is not, in the opinion of the Corporation or
the Corporation's counsel, acting reasonably, prejudicial to the Affected
Securityholders; (B) does not require the Corporation to obtain the approval
of any Governmental or Arbitral Entity or of the Corporation Shareholders and
does not require the International Purchaser to obtain the approval of its
shareholders; (C) does not impede, delay or prevent the receipt of any
Regulatory Approvals or the satisfaction of any other conditions set forth in
Article 6; (D) does not impair, impede or delay the consummation of the
Arrangement; (E) does not require any of the directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries to take any action in any
capacity other than as a director, officer, employee or agent; and (F) shall

Recommendation, Entry into Superior Proposal or Material Breach of
Non‑Solicit], Section 7.2(1)(e)(i) [Breach of Representation, Warranty or

the Corporation or Section 7.2(1)(f)(i) [Breach of Representation, Warranty or
Covenant in Favour of International Purchaser] due to a wilful breach or fraud
by the Corporation), the Purchasers shall, promptly upon request by the
Corporation: (i) reimburse the Corporation for all reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal and accountants' fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with Part B of the Pre-Closing Reorganization or any
proposed Additional Reorganization; and (ii) indemnify the Corporation, its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives for any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest Awards and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with or as a result of Part B of the Pre-Closing Reorganization or
any Additional Reorganization or as a result of any reversal, modification or
unwinding of Part B of the Pre-Closing Reorganization or any Additional
Reorganization.

notice as to the value in financial terms that the Board has, in consultation
with its financial advisors, determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under the Superior Proposal (the "Superior Proposal
Notice"); 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

the Corporation or its Representatives have provided to each Purchaser a copy
of any proposed definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

at least five (5) Business Days (the "Matching Period") have elapsed from the
date that is the later of the date on which each Purchaser shall have received
the Superior Proposal Notice and the date on which each Purchaser shall have
received a copy of the definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal; 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

after the Matching Period, the Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors, that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (and, if
applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement as proposed to be amended
by the Purchaser under Section 5.4(2)) and (ii) it is necessary for the Board
to approve, recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal in order to properly discharge its fiduciary duties;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

prior to or concurrently with making a Change in Recommendation or entering
into such definitive agreement the Corporation terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii) and pays the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.2(2). 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

During the Matching Period, or such longer period as the Corporation may
approve in writing for such purpose: (23) the Board shall review any offer
made by either Purchaser or both Purchasers to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal and financial advisors, in order to determine whether such proposal
would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously
constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal; and (23)
the Corporation shall negotiate in good faith with the Purchaser(s) to make
such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would
enable the Purchaser(s) to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on such amended terms. If as a consequence of the foregoing the
Board determines that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal, the Corporation shall promptly so advise the Purchaser(s) and the
Corporation and the Purchaser(s) shall amend this Agreement to reflect such
offer made by the Purchaser(s), and shall take and cause to be taken all such
actions as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the Corporation Shareholders or other
material terms or conditions thereof shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.4 and the Purchasers shall be
afforded a new five (5) Business Day Matching Period from the date that is the
later of the date on which each Purchaser shall have received the new Superior
Proposal Notice and the date on which each Purchaser shall have received a
copy of the proposed definitive agreement for the new Superior Proposal. 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

The Board shall promptly reaffirm the Board Recommendation by press release
after any Acquisition Proposal which is not determined to be a Superior
Proposal is publicly announced or if the Board determines that a proposed
amendment to the terms of this Agreement as contemplated under Section 5.4(2)
would result in an Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal,
as the case may be. The Corporation shall provide the Purchasers and their
respective outside legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the
form and content of any such press release and shall give reasonable
consideration to any comments thereon. 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board from responding through a
directors' circular or otherwise as required by applicable Securities Laws to
an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a Superior Proposal.
Further, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board from making any
disclosure to the Shareholders if the Board, acting in good faith and upon the
advice of its outside legal and financial advisors, shall have determined that
the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board or such disclosure is otherwise required under Law;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the Board shall be permitted to make
such disclosure, the Board shall not be permitted to make a Change in
Recommendation, other than as permitted by Section 5.4(1). 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

If the Corporation provides a Superior Proposal Notice to the Purchasers after
a date that is less than five (5) Business Days before the Corporation
Meeting, the Corporation shall be entitled to, and shall upon request from
either Purchaser, postpone the Corporation Meeting to a date that is not more
than fifteen (15) Business Days after the scheduled date of the Corporation
Meeting (and, in any event, prior to the Outside Date). 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

The Corporation will ensure that its Representatives and its Subsidiaries are
aware of the provisions of this Article 5\. The Corporation is responsible for
any breach of this Article 5 by its Representatives or its Subsidiaries.

and expenses, including the payment of brokerage fees, if a Termination Fee

International Purchaser, or as the International Purchaser may direct, in
accordance with Section 8.2(2). For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Termination Fee Event" means the termination of this Agreement: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

by either Purchaser, pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d) [Change of Recommendation,
Entry into Superior Proposal or Material Breach of Non‑Solicit]; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

Favour of Canadian Purchaser] due to a wilful breach or fraud by the

7.2(1)(f)(i) [Breach of Representation, Warranty or Covenant in Favour of
International Purchaser] due to a wilful breach or fraud by the Corporation,
if: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

following the date hereof and prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal is made or publicly announced or otherwise publicly disclosed by any
Person (other than the Purchasers or any of their affiliates, or any Person
acting jointly or in concert with any of the foregoing) or any Person (other
than the Purchaser or any of its affiliates, or any Person acting jointly or
in concert with any of the foregoing) shall have publicly announced an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

within 12 months following the date of such termination, (23) an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (i) above) is consummated by the Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (23) the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, in one or more transactions, enters into a Contract
(other than a confidentiality or standstill agreement) in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i) above) and such Acquisition
Proposal is later consummated (whether or not within 12 months after such
termination). 

For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except that references to "20%
or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more".

occurrence of such Termination Fee Event. If a Termination Fee Event occurs in

Acquisition Proposal referred to therein. Any Termination Fee shall be paid
(less any applicable withholding Tax) by the Corporation to the International
Purchaser (or as the International Purchaser may direct by notice in writing)
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by
the International Purchaser. For greater certainty, in no event shall the
Corporation be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

Expenses and Expense Reimbursement 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

expenses of the Parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including legal fees, accounting fees, financial advisory

(plus applicable Taxes, if any) of its legal, accounting and financial
advisors which are incurred by the Corporation in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If the Canadian Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(1)(e)(i) [Breach of Representation, Warranty or Covenant in Favour of
Canadian Purchaser] due to a breach by the Corporation or the International
Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(f)(i) [Breach

equal to, in the case of the Canadian Purchaser, the total of all out-of-

the Arrangement and the Financing up to a maximum of $1,000,000 and, in the
case of the International Purchaser, the total of all out-of-pocket fees and

pay under Section 8.2(1) and this Section 8.3(2), (i) in aggregate, an amount
to the International Purchaser in excess of the Termination Fee or (ii) an
Expense Reimbursement Payment to either Purchaser on more than one occasion.

Acknowledgment 

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2
and Section 8.3(2) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements none of the Parties would
enter into this Agreement, and that the amounts set out in Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3(2) represent liquidated damages which are a genuine pre‑estimate
of the damages, including opportunity costs, which any Party will suffer or
incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant
termination of this Agreement, and is not a penalty. The Corporation
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. In the event the Termination Fee
is paid to the International Purchaser (or as it directs) and an Expense
Reimbursement Payment is paid to the Canadian Purchaser (or as it directs), no
other amounts will be due and payable as damages or otherwise by the
Corporation to any other Party hereto, and the Parties hereby accept that such
payment is the maximum aggregate amount that the Corporation shall be required
to pay in lieu of any damages or any other payments or remedy which the other
Parties may be entitled to in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that this
limitation shall not apply in the event of a wilful breach by the Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (which breach and liability therefore
shall not be affected by termination of this Agreement or any payment of the
amounts set out in Section 8.2) or fraud. In the event the amounts set out in
Section 8.3(2) are paid to the Purchasers (or as they direct), no other
amounts will be due and payable as damages or otherwise by the Corporation to
the Purchasers other than pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(c), if applicable (but
for clarity, subject to the limitation set forth in the last sentence of
Section 8.3(2)), and the Purchasers accept that such payments are the maximum
aggregate amount that the Party making such payments shall be required to pay
in lieu of any damages or any other payments or remedy which the Purchasers
may be entitled to in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall
not apply in the event of a wilful breach by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (which breach and liability therefore shall not be
affected by termination of this Agreement or any payment of the amounts set
out Section 8.3(2)) or fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, while the Purchasers may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 8.7 and the payment of the Termination
Fee under Section 8.2, under no circumstances shall the Purchasers be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
Corporation's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and the Termination Fee.

8.7

|

Injunctive Relief 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Corporation and the Purchasers agree that irreparable harm would occur for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Corporation and the Purchasers shall be entitled to injunctive and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement,
and to enforce compliance with the terms of this Agreement, without any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the Corporation and the Purchasers may
be entitled at Law or in equity. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and
agreed that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Corporation and the International Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of the Canadian Purchaser's obligations to complete the
Arrangement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to seek specific
performance as a third party beneficiary of the Canadian Purchaser's rights
against the Canadian Purchaser's Bank Lender under the Bank Commitment Letter
and the Canadian Purchaser's Subordinated Commitment Lender under the
Subordinated Commitment Letter, in each case subject to the terms thereof, and
to cause the Canadian Purchaser to enforce the obligations of the Canadian
Purchaser's Bank Lender and the Canadian Purchaser's Subordinated Lender to
fund the Bank Financing under the Bank Commitment Letter and the Subordinated
Financing under the Subordinated Commitment Letter, respectively, but only in
the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Effective Time and which shall be satisfied at the Effective Time); (ii) the
Canadian Purchaser fails to deposit the Canadian Consideration in escrow with
the Depositary as required by Section 2.8(b); (iii) all of the conditions to
the consummation of the Bank Financing provided by the Bank Commitment Letter

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time and
which shall be so satisfied at the Effective Time); (iv) the International
Purchaser has deposited funds in escrow to the Depositary in accordance with
Section 2.8(a) (or specific performance of the International Purchaser's
obligations under Section 2.8(a) is also being sought); and (v) the
Corporation and (unless specific performance of the International Purchaser's
obligations under Section 2.8(b) is also being sought) the International
Purchaser have each irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Canadian Purchaser
that if specific performance is granted, and the Canadian Purchaser otherwise
complies with its obligations hereunder, it will perform its obligations in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Corporation and the Canadian Purchaser shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the International Purchaser's obligations to complete the
Arrangement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Effective Time and which shall be satisfied at the Effective Time); (ii) the
International Purchaser fails to deposit funds in escrow with the Depositary
as required by Section 2.8(a); (iii) the Canadian Purchaser has deposited
funds in escrow with the Depositary in accordance with Section 2.8(b) (or
specific performance of the Canadian Purchaser's obligations under Section
2.8(b) is also being sought); and (iv) the Corporation and (unless specific
performance of the Canadian Purchaser's obligations under Section 2.8(b) is
also being sought) the Canadian Purchaser have each irrevocably confirmed in
writing to the International Purchaser that if specific performance is
granted, and the International Purchaser otherwise complies with its
obligations hereunder, it will perform its obligations in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (a) either Party has an adequate remedy at Law or (b) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or equity. 

| 
---|--- 

8.8

|

Third Party Beneficiaries 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Except as provided in Section 2.4(e) and Section 4.11 which, without limiting
their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of the third Persons
mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred to in this Section
8.8 as the "Third Party Beneficiaries") and except for the rights of the
Affected Securityholders to receive the applicable consideration following the
Effective Time pursuant to the Arrangement (for which purpose the Corporation
hereby confirms that it is acting as agent on behalf of the Affected
Securityholders), the Parties intend that this Agreement will not benefit or
create any right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the
Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to rely
on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing
or other forum. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the Third Party
Beneficiaries their direct rights against the applicable Party under Section
2.4(e) and Section 4.11, which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Third Party Beneficiary, his or her heirs and his or her
legal representatives, and for such purpose, the Corporation confirms that it
is acting as agent on their behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on
their behalf. 

| 
---|--- 

8.9

|

Waiver 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

| 
---|--- 

8.10

|

Entire Agreement 

This Agreement, together with the Corporation Disclosure Letter, the PHI Loan
Commitment Letter and the Cooperation Agreements, constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. There
are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements,
express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement. The Parties have not relied and are not relying
on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and
completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

| 
---|---

Agreement are assignable or transferable by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that either Purchaser may
assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement to, and its
obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, any of its affiliates,
provided that it shall continue to be solidarily liable with such affiliate
for all of its obligations hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

8.12

|

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties, as applicable,
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
