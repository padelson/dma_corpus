ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in connection therewith are
reasonable individually and in the aggregate; (ii) no

       |   |   | such Plan has incurred an accumulated funding
deficiency, whether or not waived; and (iii) except as disclosed on _Schedule

six-year period preceding the Closing, have been provided through a voluntary
employees beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code).

or does provide, funding for benefits under any Plan, to the Knowledge of
Sellers (i) no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership,
conservatorship, liquidation or any similar Proceeding and no such
Proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent and (ii) except as set
forth on _Schedule_   _4.18(j)_ , there is no material Liability of the
Company or any Acquired Company in the nature of a retroactive rate
adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent material
Liability, nor would there be any such material Liability if such insurance
policy was terminated.  
      
    | k.  |   | The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents by the Sellers will not (i)
constitute a stated triggering event under any arrangement, agreement or
program, other than the Conwood Executive Retention Plan and the Conwood
Employee Severance Plan (assuming all other plan triggers are met), that will
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from the Company or any Acquired Company to any current or former officer,
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Acquired Company with
respect to the Business (or dependents of such Persons) or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation due to
any current or former officer, employee, director or consultant of the

Company nor any Acquired Company has agreed or committed to institute any

the Company or any Acquired Company with respect to the Business on or after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other

current or former employee of the Company or any Acquired Company with
respect to the Business or the dependents or other beneficiaries of any such
current or former employee.  
      
    | o.  |   | No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the
Company or any Acquired Company with respect to the Business who is a "
_disqualified individual_ " (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination
agreement, other compensation arrangement or Plan currently in effect, would
be characterized as an " _excess parachute payment_ " (as such term

All policies described or required to be described on _Schedule 4.19_ are in full force and effect, and none of the Sellers, the Company or any Acquired Company is in default, whether as to payment of premium or otherwise, in any material respect under the terms of any such policy. Sellers make no representation or warranty that such insurance will be continued or is continuable after the Closing.

 Section 4.21 _Inventory_. The values at which inventories related to the Business are shown on the Latest Balance Sheet have been determined in accordance with GAAP. The inventories related to the Business (and items of inventory related to the Business acquired or manufactured subsequent to the date of the Latest Balance Sheet) consist only of items of quality, grade, blend and quantity, to the extent applicable, commercially usable and salable in the Ordinary Course of Business, except for any items of obsolete material or material below standard quality, all of which have been written down to realizable market value, or for which adequate reserves have been provided, and the quantities, grade, blend and quality, to the extent applicable, of all inventories are reasonably sufficient to conduct the Business as presently contemplated, including, taking into account any current planned expansion or projected growth of the Business as set forth in the Budget.

is bound. Since January 1, 2002, neither the Company nor any Acquired Company
has encountered any labor union organizing activity or had any actual or, to

as otherwise provided herein, use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill

cause to be made any payment to any third party to secure any Consents.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate with, and do all
things reasonably requested to assist, one another: (i) in the prompt
preparation and filing (which filing shall occur no later than ten (10) days

The foregoing shall not require Sellers, the Company or any Acquired Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in their reasonable judgment is reasonably likely to (i) result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, the disclosure of any trade secrets or the violation of any Applicable Law or (ii) violate any of their obligations owed to any third party with respect to confidentiality if Sellers, the Company or any Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure.

that nothing herein shall require Sellers, the Company or the Acquired
Companies in connection with such Debt Financing to (i) execute any documents
that would be effective prior to the Closing or (ii) deliver or cause their
attorneys to deliver any legal opinions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, failure by Sellers to comply with their

deemed to be a breach by Sellers of a covenant hereof or constitute a failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 3.1_. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Confidentiality Matters._  

  

       | a.  |   | Sellers, the Company and the Acquired Companies
will and will cause each of their Affiliates, subsidiaries, trustees,

employee will be entitled under Parents vacation and other paid time off
policy or policies.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. Parent agrees that, for
a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at the end of the plan year

7.1(b)_.  
      
    | c.  |   | _Defined Contribution Pension Plans_. Parent agrees
that, for the Benefit Protection Period, it shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Company Employees benefits under a tax-qualified defined
contribution pension plan that provides (i) employer contributions and (ii)
the opportunity for employee   
  

  ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | contributions that both are no less favorable to
the Company Employees than those provided under the defined contribution
pension plan maintained for such Company Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | d.  |   | _Health and Welfare Benefit Plans_. Parent agrees that,
for the Benefit Protection Period, it shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to the Company Employees benefits under one or more employee
welfare benefit plans (as defined in ERISA Section 3(1)) that are
substantially similar to the benefits provided by the Plans set forth on
_Schedule 7.1(d)_, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent
Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or modifying any such benefits
to the extent required by Applicable Law or as required by any
insurer providing the funding medium for such benefits. Following the Benefit
Protection Period, Parent shall not reduce the benefits provided to Company
Employees in a manner disproportionate with reductions in coverage made under
welfare benefit plans provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.  
      
    | e.  |   | _Severance_. Parent shall maintain, or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to maintain, sponsorship of the Conwood Executive Retention

shall cause to be provided, severance benefits to Company Employees in
accordance with the terms of such Severance Plans as of the Closing Date so
long as the Company Employees are employed by Parent or one of its Affiliates
(but not beyond the time period required by the Severance Plans as of the
Closing Date). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend
or terminate either of the Severance Plans except as provided under the terms
of such Severance Plans as of the Closing Date. Any severance costs which
arise in connection with the transactions contemplated herein shall be the
sole responsibility of Parent.  
      
    | f.  |   | _Management Incentive Plan_. Parent shall:  
   

  

       | i.  |   | maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, the
Management Incentive Plan (as described on  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | _Schedule 7.1(f)(i)_) as in effect on the Closing
Date through the end of the fiscal year which contains the Closing Date.
Parent shall establish, or shall cause to be established, a bonus pool in an
amount equal to 5% of the combined pre-tax profit for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2006 of the Acquired Companies (as presently constituted), as
determined prior to any reduction due to the formation of this bonus pool and
otherwise determined in accordance with GAAP and the practices customarily
followed by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date. The entire
bonus pool established under the Management Incentive Plan shall be
distributed to Company Employees in accordance with the terms of such plan.
Except to the extent required to satisfy the requirements of Code Section
409A or any other Applicable Law, no amendment made to the Management
Incentive Plan prior to the end of the fiscal year which contains the Closing
Date will adversely affect participants of such plan. Any costs which arise
in connection with payments made under the Management Incentive Plan after
the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of Parent; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | ii.  |   | maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, the
Sales Incentive Plan (as described on _Schedule 7.1(f)(ii)_) in place as
of the Closing Date through the end of the fiscal year which contains
the Closing Date. Parent shall establish, or shall cause to be established,
a bonus pool in an amount equal to 1% of the adjusted net income of
the Acquired Companies (as presently constituted), as determined prior to
any reduction due to the formation of this bonus pool and otherwise
determined in accordance with GAAP and the practices customarily followed by
the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date. The entire bonus
pool established under the Sales Incentive Plan shall be distributed to
Company Employees in accordance with the terms of such plan. No amendment
made to the Sales Incentive Plan prior to the end of the fiscal year which
contains the Closing Date will adversely affect participants of such plan.
Any costs which arise  
   

  ##### 

  

   

in connection with payments made under the Sales Incentive Plan after the
Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of Parent. 

  

       | g.  |   | _Key Employee Bonus Policy_. Parent shall
maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, the Key Employee Bonus Policy (as
described on _Schedule 7.1(g)_) in place as of the Closing Date through the
end of the fiscal year which contains the Closing Date. Any costs which arise
in connection with the payments made under the Key Employee Bonus Plan after
the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of Parent.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | h.  |   | _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for Retirees and
Beneficiaries_. Parent agrees that, for the Benefit Protection Period, it
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to retirees of the Business
(including Company Employees who retired during the Benefit Protection
Period) and their beneficiaries (collectively " _Retirees_ ") post-retirement
health, life and other welfare benefits that are substantially similar to the
benefits provided by the Plans set forth on _Schedule 7.1(h)_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent Parent or any of its
Affiliates from amending or modifying any such benefits to the extent
required by Applicable Law or as required by any insurer providing the
funding medium for such benefits (such benefits, as they may be so amended or
modified, the " _Seller Retiree Welfare Benefits_ "). Following the Benefit
Protection Period, Parent shall not reduce the Seller Retiree Welfare
Benefits in a manner that is disproportionate with any reductions in coverage
provided to similarly situated retirees of Parent under welfare benefit
plans.  
      
    | i.  |   | _Coordination of Coverage_. With respect to each Company
Employee who begins participation in a health plan maintained by Parent or
one of its Affiliates during the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, take into account
expenses incurred by such Company Employee (during the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs) under the health plan in which Company
Employees are participants for purposes of determining deductibles and out-
of-pocket limits under Parents or its Affiliates health plans for the
remainder of the calendar year. Parent shall waive, or shall cause its
Affiliate to waive, all limitations  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Company Employees.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | j.  |   | _Deferred Compensation Plans_. Parent shall maintain, or
shall cause to be maintained, the deferred compensation plans listed on
_Schedule 7.1(j)_ solely for the benefit of those individuals who have
amounts payable to them thereunder as of the Closing Date, through the end of
the calendar year which contains the Closing Date.  
      
    | k.  |   | _No Amendment or Termination_. Parent agrees that during
the Benefit Protection Period, it will not make, and will not permit to be
made, any amendment to a Plan or take any other action, that adversely
affects a Company Employee, unless such amendment is required by Applicable
Law or permitted by this _Section 7.1_. An amendment includes the
termination of a benefit or a Plan.  
      
    | l.  |   | _Required Contributions_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers shall make, or shall cause to be made, (i) all contributions
(including, without limitation, all employer matching or other contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions) to and payments from any Plan in
respect of any Company Employees or Retirees (except those distributions to
be made from a trust qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) that
pursuant to the Plans or in accordance with Sellers past practice and in the
ordinary course, become due or would normally be paid prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) the contributions to the Plans set forth on _Schedule 7.1(b)_
to be made for the 2005 plan year of such Plans, regardless of whether
in accordance with Sellers past practice and in the ordinary course such
contributions would be paid after the Closing Date.  
   

  

 Section 7.2 _Directors , Managers and Officers Indemnification; Release from Liability_. 

  

       | a.  |   | From and after the Closing Date for a period of
six years, the provisions of the certificates of incorporation, by-laws,
limited liability company operating agreements and other constitutive
documents of the Company or any of the Acquired Companies concerning the
elimination of liability and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

indemnification of directors, managers, and officers shall not be amended in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person
that is as of the date hereof or the Closing Date a current or former
officer, manager or director of the Company and/or any Acquired Company. From
and after the Closing Date for a period of six years, New Asworth and/or any
Acquired Company (the " _D andO Indemnitors_") shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is, or at the Closing Date will be, a current or
former officer, manager or director of the Company and/or any Acquired
Company (the " _D andO Indemnitees_") against all Losses arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) of the DandO
Indemnitees, or any of them, in their capacities as such to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, subject to the DandO Indemnitors receipt
of an undertaking by such DandO Indemnitee to repay such Losses paid in advance
if it is ultimately determined that such DandO Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
DandO Indemnitors will not be liable for any settlement effected without the
DandO Indemnitors prior written consent and will not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
DandO Indemnitees) for all DandO Indemnitees in any jurisdiction with respect to
a single Proceeding, except to the extent that two or more of such DandO
Indemnitees shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of, or differing
defenses available with respect to, such claim, action, suit, Proceeding or
investigation. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory rather
than permissive, and New Asworth and/or any Acquired Company, as applicable,
shall promptly advance expenses in connection with such indemnification to
the extent permitted under Applicable Law. Parent shall not cause New Asworth
or any of the Acquired Companies to engage in any business combination,
reorganization or other extraordinary transaction which, immediately after
the consummation thereof, has the effect, or could reasonably be expected to
have the effect, of reducing the aggregate consolidated net worth of New
Asworth and the Acquired Companies below that set forth in the Latest Capital
Balance Sheet. 

   ##### 

  

  

       | b.  |   | Effective upon the Closing, Parent and New Asworth
and/or any Acquired Company, and each of their respective representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), shall be
deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged the individuals set
forth on _Schedule 7.2(b)_ (collectively, the " _D andO Released Parties_") of
and from any and all claims which the Releasing Parties, or any of them, now
have, ever had, or at the Closing may have, or hereafter can, shall or may
have, against the DandO Released Parties, or any of them, for, upon or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Releasing Parties
shall not be deemed to release any Company Employee who is a DandO Released
Party for any claims arising out of any misconduct, including any violation
of Applicable Law, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and/or any
other willful, reckless or wanton conduct by such Company Employee.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

As of the Closing Date, Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties,
expressly acknowledges that it has had, or has had and waived, the
opportunity to be advised by independent legal counsel and hereby waives and
relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code (and any analogous law of any other state, locality or
other jurisdiction) and does so understanding and acknowledging
the significance and consequence of such specific waiver of Section 1542
which provides: 

   

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

  

       | c.  |   | Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties
(which with respect to New Asworth and the Acquired Companies relates only to
after the Closing), hereby represents, warrants and covenants to each DandO
Released Party that there has not been and will not be any assignment or
other transfer of any right or interest in any claims that any Releasing
Party ever had, has or may have against the DandO Released Parties, and hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold each DandO Released Party harmless from any claims
and Losses  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | directly or indirectly incurred by any of the DandO
Released Parties as a result of any Person asserting any right or interest
pursuant to any such purported assignment or transfer of any such right or
interest.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | d.  |   | Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties,
hereby agrees that if any Releasing Party hereafter commences (which with
respect to New Asworth and the Acquired Companies relates only to any such
actions taken from and after the Closing), joins in, or in any manner seeks
relief through any suit arising out of, based upon, or relating to any of the
claims released hereunder, or in any manner asserts again any DandO Released
Party any of the claims released hereunder, then such Releasing Parties
will pay to such DandO Released Party, in addition to any other Losses, direct
or indirect, all attorneys fees incurred in defending or otherwise
responding to such suit or claims.  
      
    | e.  |   | The provisions of this _Section 7.2_ are (i) intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each DandO Indemnitee,
DandO Released Party and each such Persons heirs, representatives, successors
or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.2_ , and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other right to indemnification or contribution that any
such DandO Indemnitee or DandO Released Party may have by contract or otherwise.
Following the Closing, neither Parent nor any of New Asworth and/or any
Acquired Company shall (A) amend the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ in a
manner that would adversely affect any such third party beneficiary without
the prior written consent of such third party beneficiary or (B) enter into,
or permit any of its Affiliates to enter into, any merger, consolidation or
similar transaction unless Parent shall have ensured that the surviving or
resulting entity is creditworthy and will assume the obligations imposed by
this _Section 7.2_. With respect to any claim by a third party beneficiary
under this _Section 7.2_, no Releasing Party may assert by way of defense,
set-off, or counterclaim, any claim against, or Losses owing by, Seller or
another third party beneficiary.  
      
    | f.  |   | Parent agrees to, at Closing and from time to time
thereafter, to cause New Asworth and/or any Acquired  
   

  ##### 

  

   

Company to execute and deliver such other documents and instruments and take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Sellers or any DandO
Released Party or DandO Indemnitee to implement the provisions of this 
_Section 7.2_ including to confirm New Asworths or any Acquired
Companys release and agreement to provide indemnification as described
herein. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Notice of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof through the Closing, each applicable Party, upon obtaining knowledge of such matter, shall give notice to the other Parties of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, after the date hereof of any event which occurrence or failure would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto to be materially untrue or inaccurate, as it relates to such Party, and (b) any failure of the Party to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule hereto. From the date hereof through the Closing, Sellers, upon obtaining knowledge of such matter, will promptly notify the Purchaser of any material Proceeding threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting the Company or any Acquired Company. From time to time prior to the Closing, Sellers shall have the right to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such supplement or amendment shall be deemed to have cured any breach of a representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such development either for purposes of determining whether any condition of Closing set forth in _Article III_ has been satisfied or whether the Purchaser is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Publicity_. The Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any securities exchange on which the securities of a Party or an Affiliate are listed, neither Party shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written approval of the other Party. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Post-Closing Access_ a. . Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.5(a)(iv), following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall (i) allow Sellers, upon reasonable prior notice 

   ##### 

  

  

and during regular business hours, through their employees and
representatives, the right to examine and make copies of the books and
records transferred to the Purchaser at the Closing for any reasonable
business purpose relating to their respective businesses, including
the preparation or examination of Tax Returns, regulatory filings and
financial statements and the conduct of any litigation or the conduct of any
regulatory, contract holder, participant or other dispute resolution whether
pending or threatened, and (ii) maintain such books and records
for examination and copying by Sellers for a period of not less than five
years following the Closing Date; _provided_ that after such five-year period
the Purchaser shall provide Sellers with at least twenty (20) Business Days
written notice prior to destroying or disposing of any such books and records
at which time and at the option and expense of Sellers, the Purchaser shall
deliver such books and records to Sellers, rather than destroying the same.
Access to such books and records shall be at Sellers expense, and may not
unreasonably interfere with the Purchasers or any successor companys
business operations. Sellers may retain (a) one copy of the
materials included in the data room organized by Sellers in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together with a copy of all
documents referred to in such materials, (b) all internal correspondence and
memoranda, valuations, investment banking presentations and bids received
from others in connection with the sale of the Shares, and (c) a copy of all
consolidating and consolidated financial information and all other accounting
records prepared or used in connection with the preparation of the Financial
Statements. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Agreement Not to Compete_. 

  

       | a.  |   | Sellers hereby acknowledge and recognize the
highly competitive nature of the Business, and accordingly, agree that,
during and for a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date,
none of Sellers shall:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | i.  |   | be engaged, directly or indirectly, either for its
own account, as an investor or otherwise (except as a passive investor
owning less than five percent (5%) of the equity or holding less than five
percent (5%) of a debt instrument in an entity) by any person, firm,
corporation or enterprise engaged in the business of manufacturing,
developing, selling, distributing, advertising and marketing smokeless
tobacco products in the contiguous United States of America (the " _Non-
Competition Area_ ");  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

  

       | ii.  |   | provide financial (except as a passive investor
owning less than five percent (5%) of the equity or holding less than five
percent (5%) of a debt instrument in an entity) assistance to any person,
firm, corporation, or enterprise engaged in the business of
manufacturing, developing, selling, distributing, advertising and marketing
smokeless tobacco products in the Non-Competition Area;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | iii.  |   | directly or indirectly contact, solicit or induce
any person, corporation or other entity who or which, as of the Closing Date,
is a customer, supplier or distributor of the Company or any Acquired
Company to become a customer, supplier or distributor of smokeless tobacco
products in the Non-Competition Area for any person or entity other than New
Asworth, an Acquired Company or the Purchaser; or  
      
    | iv.  |   | directly or indirectly solicit, induce or encourage
any employee or officer of the Company or any Acquired Company, who is
employed on the Closing Date, to leave the employ of the Company, any
Acquired Company or the Purchaser, or to seek, obtain or accept employment
with any person other than New Asworth, any Acquired Company or the
Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
the solicitation or hiring of any employee or officer of the Company or any
Acquired Company who (i) is terminated after the Closing by the Company or
any Acquired Company or (ii) responds to a general advertisement for
employment by Sellers or any Affiliate thereof.  
   

  

       | b.  |   | Sellers acknowledge and agree that money damages
would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.6_ and that in addition to any other remedies available to
the Purchaser, the Purchaser will be entitled to the remedies of injunctive
relief, specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or
actual breach of the agreements contained in this  _Section 7.6_ without any
requirement that the Purchaser post a bond. The Parties hereto agree that the
provisions of this  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

 _Section 7.6_ are reasonable. If a court determines, however, that any
provision of this _Section 7.6_ is unreasonable, either in period of time,
geographical area or otherwise, then the Parties hereto agree that the
provisions of this _Section 7.6_ should be interpreted and enforced to the
maximum extent which such court deems reasonable. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Closing Net Working Capital_. No less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement, certified by the chief financial officer of the Company, of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. Sellers covenant and agree that the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date shall be no less than $130,000,000. Following receipt of such statement, Sellers shall, and shall cause their advisors to, consult with the Purchaser and its advisors on the calculation of Net Working Capital and shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser, information reasonably requested to support the basis on which the statement was prepared. Sellers shall cooperate with the Purchaser to resolve any disputes as to such calculation prior to Closing. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Insurance Proceeds_. Sellers agree that in the event of any insurance recovery related to property, casualty, or business interruption insurance relating to the Business, they will cause such recovery to remain in or be transferred to an Acquired Company. In addition, Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims arising under such policies with respect to events occurring prior to Closing. 

  

 Section 7.9 _Performance Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due and punctual performance of all of the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION 

   

 Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

       | a.  |   | by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | by either Party by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to September 24, 2006 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _clause (b)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill  
   

  ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Outside Date;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | c.  |   | by either Party if (i) any Applicable Law of a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have been enacted,
entered or promulgated prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) as a result of a Proceeding a Party shall have
been permanently restrained, enjoined or otherwise prohibited from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Proceeding shall
have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the Party seeking
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _clause (c)_ shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to remove the effects of such Applicable
Law or Proceeding, and such Party shall have complied with its obligations
under _Section 6.3_ ;  
      
    | d.  |   | by either Party upon a material breach by the other
Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, which breach has not
been cured within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof has been
provided to such other Party; _provided_ that there shall be no right to
terminate if such breach was caused, in whole or in part, by a material
breach by the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_clause (d)_ ;  
      
    | e.  |   | by Sellers, if the condition set forth in _Section
3.2(a)_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment and is not cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof has been provided by the
Purchaser to Sellers; or  
      
    | f.  |   | by the Purchaser, if the condition set forth in _Section
3.1(a)_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment and is not cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof has been provided by Sellers to
the Purchaser.  
   

  

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted under  _Section 8.1_, such termination shall be without Liability to either Party or their respective Affiliates, and following such termination neither Party shall have any Liability under this Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_  that no 

   ##### 

  

  

such termination shall relieve any Party that has willfully breached any
provision of this Agreement from Liability for such breach, and any such
breaching Party shall remain fully liable for any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the other Party as a result of such breach. The provisions of
_Section 7.4_, _Article XI_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

ARTICLE IX  TAX MATTERS 

   

 Section 9.1 _Prohibited Tax Election_. It is agreed and understood that the Parties shall not make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code in respect of the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, none of the Purchaser, the Company, the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates shall make any other election, file any amended return or take any other action with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) which could adversely affect the Tax liability of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (affiliation being measured following Closing), including any indemnification obligation of Sellers under _Section 9.4_ or any rights of Sellers to receive amounts under  _Section 9.5(a)(iii)_, without the prior written consent of Sellers. 

  

 Section 9.2 _Tax Returns_. Sellers shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with the appropriate Governmental Authorities relating to the Company and/or the Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period included in a Straddle Period) and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and/or the Acquired Companies for all Post-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods, and shall cause the Company and/or the Acquired Companies to pay or cause to be paid the Taxes shown to be due thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid the portion of any Taxes due with respect to such returns attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, calculated in accordance with Section 9.4(c). Sellers shall furnish to the Purchaser all information and records in their possession and reasonably requested by the Purchaser for use in preparation of any Tax Returns relating to a Straddle Period. The Purchaser shall allow Sellers to review, comment upon and reasonably approve without undue delay any Straddle Period Tax Returns beginning at least forty-five (45) days before the filing of Straddle Period Tax Returns. To the 

   ##### 

  

   

extent that a Straddle Period could be eliminated for such period by the
filing of separate Tax Returns by Purchaser, Sellers, the Company, or any
Acquired Company, such separate Tax Returns shall be filed. The Purchaser
shall not be entitled to file a Tax Return for the Company or any Acquired
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) in any
jurisdiction in which the Sellers have not filed a Tax Return. 

  

 Section 9.3 _Tax Cooperation_. Sellers and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all inquiries, disputes and audits (including any Tax Claim) with respect to Taxes of the Company and the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for any Straddle Period. Such cooperation and assistance shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such inquiry, audit, dispute, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to execute Tax Returns, provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at any Proceeding. Each Party agrees, and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company and each Acquired Company, (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the other Party, any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records; _provided_ _further_  that, in the event of such notice, if a Party so requests, the other Party shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Acquired Company to, allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records. Sellers shall be entitled to retain copies of all Tax Returns filed by the Company or the Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. The Parties further agree to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). In the event of a determination for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that the S Election of the Company is invalid or that the status of the Company as an S Corporation is otherwise subject, for any reason, to 

   ##### 

  

   

termination for such Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Parties shall cooperate
in seeking approval from the IRS pursuant to Code Sections 1362(b)(5) or
1362(f) to retain the Companys S Corporation status for any such Pre-Closing
Tax Period. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

       | a.  |   | Subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article IX_, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall cause Remainco to
enter into a joinder agreement at the Closing pursuant to which Remainco
shall agree to become a party to this Agreement to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees as provided in  _Section 10.6_ from and
against all Liability for (i) Taxes of the Company or the Acquired Companies
(other than Purchaser Taxes) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including,
without limitation, (ii) any Taxes of the Company or the Acquired
Companies imposed under Sections 1374 or 1375 of the Code, (iii) Taxes
arising from or relating to the Preliminary Transactions, (iv) without
duplication, any Losses resulting from any breach of any of
the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.9(k_) and _4.17_
 (determined for purposes of this _Section 9.4_ without reference to
any qualification in such representation or warranty of materiality, Material
Adverse Effect, substantial compliance or dollar threshold) and (v) without
duplication, all Losses arising from a breach by the Sellers of any covenant
contained in this Article IX. Such Taxes shall not include Taxes or the
amount of such Taxes paid by the Company and the Acquired Companies at or
prior to the Closing or paid by Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other
than the Company or the Acquired Companies) at any time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Sellers nor Remainco
shall be liable for or pay for (i) any Taxes that are imposed on the Company
or any Acquired Company as a result of actions taken or elections made by the
Purchaser, the Company or any Acquired Company after the Closing
Date (collectively, " _Purchaser Taxes_ "), including elections under Section
338(g) of the Code or Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-3 or (ii) any Taxes
subject to indemnification by the Purchaser under this _Section 9.4_.
Liability for Taxes includes any Tax payment as a result of a settlement,  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | agreed order, closing agreement, or other similar
compromise.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article
IX_, from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against all Liability for
(i) Taxes of the Company and each Acquired Company for any Post-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) Purchaser Taxes; and (iii) all Losses arising from a breach by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates of any covenant contained in this _Article
IX_.  
      
    | c.  |   | In the case of any Straddle Period:  
   

  

       | i.  |   | With respect to taxes that are levied on a per
diem basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ "), the amount of such Taxes that will be
treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in the Straddle Period; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | ii.  |   | With respect to all Taxes other than Per Diem Taxes,
the amount of such Taxes that will be treated as attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Tax that would have
been due if the relevant Straddle Period ended as of the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and such date was the last day of a hypothetical
Tax period ending on such date.  
   

  

       | d.  |   | Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that
include a penalty for failure to participate in a Tax amnesty program, any
voluntary compliance program, or failure to report any reportable or listed
transaction required by any Governmental Authority, or any similar program or
requirement, shall be reimbursed, paid, and indemnified to the Purchaser by
Sellers.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | e.  |   | The indemnity under this _Article IX_ shall be payable
solely by Remainco as set forth in _Section 10.6_.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

 Section 9.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_. 

  

       | a.  |   | If an inquiry, an audit or a claim shall be
initiated by any Tax authority which, if successful, might result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 9.4_ , the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party within ten (10) Business Days of such claim (a
" _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced as a result of
such failure, and the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified
Party is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the
Indemnified Partys Losses would have been less had such notice of Tax Claim
been timely delivered.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | i.  |   | With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than a Pre-Closing Period that is a part of a
Straddle Period), Sellers shall have the exclusive right, subject to
Purchasers opportunity to review and comment, to control all
inquiries, audits or Proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claim, including all decisions to grant or deny any
waiver or extension of the applicable statute of limitation. Sellers
direction of these proceedings shall be at Sellers own expense; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Sellers may not settle, compromise or take any
other action with respect to a Tax Claim that results in any increased
Tax Liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of the Purchaser or the
Purchasers tax group without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | ii.  |   | The Purchaser shall control all Proceedings with
respect to any Tax Claim relating to any Straddle Period and any other Post-
Closing Tax Period (whether or not it is part of a Straddle Period). Sellers
shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Tax Claim relating
to a Straddle Period for which they have an indemnity obligation under
Articles IX or X, and shall have the right to employ professional advisors
and  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | counsel, at Sellers own expense, separate from the
professional advisors and counsel employed by the Purchaser. Both the
Purchaser and Sellers shall in good faith cooperate with one another with
respect to any such Tax Claims, and the Purchaser shall not unreasonably
reject any suggestions made by Sellers with respect to such Tax Claims. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon Sellers request) the
provision to Sellers of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claims (including copies of all protests, pleadings, briefs,
filings, correspondence and similar materials relative to such Tax Claims),
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder,
and cooperating and assisting in the investigation, defense and resolution
of such Tax Claims. The Purchasers direction of these Proceedings shall be
at the Purchasers own expense; provided however, that the Purchaser may not
settle, compromise or tax any other action with respect to a Tax Claim that
results in any increased Tax Liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of the
Sellers without the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | iii.  |   | The Persons bearing the Liability or obligation
to indemnify for any Taxes described under _Section 9.4_ shall be entitled
to any refunds or credits of such Taxes. The Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Acquired Companies to promptly pay to Sellers any refunds or
credits that are received or used in any manner by the Purchaser, the Company
and/or the Acquired Companies and are due to Sellers pursuant to the terms of
this _Section 9.5(a)(iii)_, and the Sellers shall promptly pay to the
Purchaser any refunds or credits that are received or used by Sellers and are
due the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 9.5(a)(iii)_.  
   

  

 Section 9.6 _Coordination With Article X_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the recourse of any Purchaser Indemnitee for any and all Losses relating to or 

   ##### 

  

   

arising from Tax matters, including those set forth in _Sections 4.9(k)_ and
_4.17_ or this _Article IX_ shall be controlled by this _Article IX_ rather
than _Article X_. In the event the provisions of _Sections 9.4_ or _9.5_ and
the provisions of  _Article X_ conflict or otherwise each apply by their
terms, _Sections 9.4_ or  _9.5_ , as applicable, shall exclusively govern
all matters concerning Taxes; _provided_  that the survival periods,
limitations on any indemnification obligations, procedures and other terms
set forth in _Sections 10.1,_ _10.2_ , _10.5_ , and _10.6_ shall apply in
any event. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the Preliminary Transactions will be paid by Sellers when due. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the purchase of the Shares as provided in _Section 2.1_ of this Agreement shall be shared equally by the Purchaser and Sellers. Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate in the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. 

  

ARTICLE X  INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for the applicable period set forth in this _Section 10.1_, and any and all claims and causes of action for indemnification under _Article IX_ (whether or not arising out of an inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Party) and this  _Article X_ arising out of the inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of a Party must be made prior to the termination of the applicable Survival Period. The Parties agree that all of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement and any and all claims and causes of action for indemnification under _Article IX_ and this _Article X_ shall survive as follows: 

  

       | a.  |   | the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.1_,  _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4_ and _4.5_ shall survive the
Closing indefinitely;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.9(k)_,  _4.13_ , _4.17_ and _4.18_ , and the indemnities
provided in  _Sections 9.4_ and _9.5_ , shall survive the Closing until the
date three months after  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | the later of expiration of the statute of
limitations relevant to the applicable representation or the conclusion of
any challenge by a Governmental Authority (the " _Extended Survival Period_
"); and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | c.  |   | all other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
second anniversary of the Closing unless, in the case of covenants or
agreements, a specified survival period is otherwise set forth in this
Agreement(in which case such specified date will control)(the " _General
Survival Period_ " and the Extended Survival Period, each a " _Survival
Period_ " and collectively the " _Survival Periods_ ").  
   

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) any obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless pursuant to _Sections_   _10.2(a), (b)_ and _(c)_ shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with _Section 10.3_; and (ii) this _Section 10.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which contemplates performance after the Closing. 

  

 Section 10.2 _Obligation to Indemnify_. 

  

       | a.  |   | Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article X_, if the Closing occurs, the LLC Seller agrees, and the Trust
Sellers agree to cause each Trust, jointly and severally, to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, successors, permitted assigns, agents
and representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and
against all Losses resulting from: (i) any breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ (other than the
representations and warranties in  _Sections 4.9(k)_ and _4.17_ ; _provided_
, _however_ , that in determining whether and the extent to which the
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification, all references in any
representation or warranty to materiality, Material Adverse Effect,
substantial compliance or dollar threshold shall be ignored and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that _Sections 4.9(k)_ and _4.17_  are only subject to the
indemnification provisions of _Sections 9.4_ and  _9.5_ ;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | and (ii) any breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Shareholder shall be liable for any Losses arising out of a breach of
the representation and warranty contained in _Section 4.1_ relating to the
Shares of another Shareholder. The indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders for Losses pursuant to clauses _(a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ of this
_Section 10.2_ shall be payable by the Shareholders solely out of the Escrow
Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall be the sole and
exclusive source of payment for any such indemnification obligation, except
for any Loss resulting from the breach of a representation or warranty set
forth in _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ , _4.3_ ,  _4.4_ and _4.5_ which, after the
entire Escrow Amount has been disbursed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
shall also entitle a Purchaser Indemnitee to indemnification from Remainco as
provided in _Section 10.6_ hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
X_, if the Closing occurs, Sellers shall cause Remainco to enter into a
joinder agreement at the Closing pursuant to which Remainco shall agree to
become a party to this Agreement solely to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees as provided in  _Section 10.6_ from and
against all Losses resulting from (i) any Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities (other than Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
constitute Excluded Liabilities, which Taxes are the subject of _Sections
9.4_ and  _9.5_ ) and (ii) any Indebtedness, to the extent not taken into
account in calculating the Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 7.7_.  
      
    | c.  |   | Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
X_, and except as otherwise provide in _Sections 9.4_ and _9.5_ with respect
to Taxes, if the Closing occurs, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Seller, the Trusts and their Affiliates as well as
their respective directors, officers, employees, successors, permitted
assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_
"), from and against all Losses resulting from: (i) any breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in  _Article V_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in determining whether and the extent to which  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | the Seller Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification, all references in any representation or warranty to
materiality, material adverse effect, substantial compliance or dollar
threshold shall be ignored; (ii) any breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement; and (iii) the
operations of New Asworth or the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | d.  |   | Except with respect to breaches of _Sections 4.1_,
_4.2_ ,  _4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ , _4.9(k)_ , and _4.17_ , the
aggregate amount for which the Shareholders shall be liable under _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed the Escrow Amount. Except with respect
to breaches of  _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ ,  _4.9(k)_
and _4.17_ , the Shareholders shall be required to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ only if the aggregate Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees in connection with such subsection
exceeds $15,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which event, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall be indemnified to the full extent of their Losses. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 10.2_
shall apply to the indemnification obligations of Seller set forth in 
_Section 10.2(b)(ii)_. In calculating the amount of Losses of the
Purchaser Indemnitees, all Losses which individually total less than $50,000
shall be excluded in their entirety (and such items shall not be aggregated
for purposes of calculating the Threshold), and the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not have any recourse against the Shareholders for such Losses.  
      
    | e.  |   | The aggregate amount for which the Purchaser shall be
liable under _Section 10.2(c)(i)_ hereof shall in no event exceed
$150,000,000. The Purchaser shall be required to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)(i)_ hereof only if the aggregate
Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnitees in connection with such subsection
exceeds the Threshold, in which event, the Seller Indemnitees shall be
indemnified to the full extent of their Losses. In calculating the amount
of Losses of the Seller Indemnitees, all Losses which individually total less
than $50,000 shall be excluded in their entirety (and such items shall not be
aggregated for purposes of the prior sentence), and the Seller Indemnitees
shall not  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | have any recourse against the Purchaser for such
Losses.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | f.  |   | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Person shall, in any event, be liable under _Sections 9.4_ or _9.5_ or this
_Article X_ to any other Person for any consequential, incidental, indirect,
special or punitive damages of such other Person, including loss of future
revenue, income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof.  
      
    | g.  |   | The Shareholders and Remainco shall have no Liability
under _Sections 9.4_ or _9.5_ or this _Article X_ to the Purchaser
Indemnitees in respect of any Losses to the extent that:  
   

  

       | i.  |   | provision or reserve in respect of any Liability
or other matter giving rise to the Loss (or any part thereof) was made in the
Audited Financial Statements or the Unaudited Financial Statements;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | ii.  |   | the Loss (or any part thereof) would not have arisen
but for an act, omission or transaction on the part of or carried out by
the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser (including New Asworth and
the Acquired Companies after the Closing);  
      
    | iii.  |   | the Loss in question arises, or is increased, as a
result of a change after the Closing in any accounting policy, any Tax
reporting practice or the length of any accounting period for Tax purposes of
New Asworth or the Acquired Companies; or  
      
    | iv.  |   | the Loss (or any part thereof) in question arises from
or relates to (a) any product Liability arising from the research,
development, manufacture, sale, advertising, distribution, consuming,
marketing or use of smokeless tobacco products or (b) the MSA.  
   

  

       | h.  |   | The amount of any Losses under _Sections 9.4_ or
_9.5_ or this  _Article X_ sustained by a Purchaser Indemnitee or a Seller
Indemnitee shall be reduced by any amount received by such Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee with respect thereto under any insurance  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | coverage or from any other Party alleged to
be responsible therefor, and by the amount of any Tax benefit actually
realized with respect to the Loss. The Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under such insurance coverage and from such other Party alleged to
have responsibility with respect to the Loss. If a Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee realizes a Tax benefit or receives an amount under
insurance coverage or from such other Party with respect to Losses sustained
at any time subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to  _Sections
9.4_ or _9.5_ or this _Article X_, then such Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection
with providing such indemnification up to such amount realized or received by
the Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | i.  |   | Upon making any indemnification payment under _Sections
9.4_ or  _9.5_ or this _Article X_, the Indemnifying Party will, to the
extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the payment relates;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that until the Indemnified Party recovers full
payment of its Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any
such third party on account of said payment are hereby made expressly
subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the Indemnified Partys
rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality of any other
provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination
rights.  
      
    | j.  |   | Neither Sellers or Remainco, on the one hand, nor the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall have any right to set off any Losses
under _Sections 9.4_ or  _9.5_ or this _Article X_ against any payments to
be made by such Party or Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any other
agreement among the Parties.  
      
    | k.  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers indemnification obligation under  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | _Article X_ in respect of Remedial Action
is subject to the provisions of this _Section 10.2(k)_. Sellers shall
be responsible for the cost of Remedial Action only to the extent necessary
to reasonably comply with the remediation or compliance standard consistent
with the industrial/commercial use of the property as intended to be used as
of the Closing Date, which standard will be reasonable if acceptable to the
applicable Governmental Authorities. Sellers shall not be responsible for
those costs incurred in connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such
costs arise from or are exacerbated by actions of Purchaser after the Closing
Date. Further, Sellers shall not be responsible for costs incurred in
connection with a Remedial Action unless such Remedial Action is (i) required
by a Governmental Authority acting pursuant to Environmental and
Safety Requirements; (ii) required to respond to a judgment or an order in a
third party claim or action; (iii) required to respond to a condition
discovered in connection with the normal day-to-day operation of a facility
or a facility expansion or demolition actually implemented by Purchaser where
such Remedial Action is necessary to permit such operation, expansion or
demolition; or (iv) required to respond to a condition which presents a
substantial endangerment to human health; _provided_ that Sellers shall have
no Liability or responsibility for any of the matters described in
the immediately preceding _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ to the extent
that such matter arises from product Liability due to the research,
development, manufacture, sale, advertising, distribution, consuming,
marketing or use of smokeless tobacco products.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | l.  |   | The provisions of this _Section 10.2_ are (i) intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each of the Purchaser
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, and each such Persons
heirs, representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that
such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.2_.  
   

  

 Section 10.3 _Claims Notice_. In the event that either a Purchaser Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee wishes to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder (other than indemnification for a Tax Claim under _Article IX_ which shall be governed by _Article IX_), such Party seeking indemnification (the 

   ##### 

  

    

" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver written notice (a " _Claims Notice_ ")
to the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after written notice of such claim is delivered to the
Indemnified Party, specifying in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the
facts constituting the basis for, and the amount (if known) of, the claim
asserted. Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with respect to a claim in a
timely manner as specified in the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a
waiver of the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder for
Losses in connection with such claim except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. 

  

 Section 10.4 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Parties_. __  

  

       | a.  |   | Except as provided in _Article IX_, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following
receipt of notice thereof, to investigate, contest, assume the defense of or
settle any claim or demand made, or any action, Proceeding or investigation
instituted, by any Person not a party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party
Claimant_ ") that may result in a Loss with respect to which the
Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article X_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party may, at its option and at its own expense, participate in the
investigation, contesting, defense or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim through representatives and counsel of its own choosing; and,
_provided_ _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third
Party Claim unless (i) such settlement is on exclusively monetary terms and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising
out of such settlement either concurrently or with the effectiveness thereof,
(ii)such settlement includes a complete and irrevocable general release
executed by all Persons who brought such Third Party Claim, which release
shall release the Indemnified Party from any Liability, or (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to the terms of such
settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof and for any
period during which the interests of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party may conflict, giving rise to the right of the Indemnified Party to
employ counsel of its own choosing. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
shall have assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not settle, compromise or pay any Third Party Claim for which it
seeks indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party.  
---|---|---|---

in (but not to control) the defense of any Third Party Claim which it has not
elected to assume the defense of with its own counsel and at its own
expense.  
      
    | c.  |   | The Purchaser and each Seller or Remainco, as
applicable, shall make mutually available to each other all relevant
information in their possession relating to any Third Party Claim (except to
the extent that such action would result in a loss of attorney client
privilege) and shall cooperate with each other in the defense thereof.  
   

  

 Section 10.5 _Indemnification Payments_. Any payment under _Sections 9.4_ or  _9.5_ or _Article X_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as the Indemnified Party shall designate to the Indemnifying Party in writing or as set forth in the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 Section 10.6 _Satisfaction of Remainco Indemnification Obligations_. Remainco shall, subject to the terms of _Schedule 10.6_, provide for the indemnification set forth in  _Sections 9.4_ and _10.2(b)_. 

  

 Section 10.7 _Exclusivity_. In the absence of fraud, following the Closing, the indemnities provided for in Article IX and Article X shall be the exclusive remedies of the Parties and their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, any breach, non-fulfillment or default in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and any

 Section 11.2 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. 

  

 Section 11.3 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States sitting in the County of New Castle, Delaware for the purposes of any suit, action or other Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, and waives any objection based on _forum non conveniens_. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by certified or registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.3_. 

  

 Section 11.4 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

If any Proceeding is brought by one Party against another Party, the party succeeding or prevailing in whole shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in that action or Proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

 Section 11.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including any additional agreements contemplated hereby or thereby and the Disclosure Schedules) contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in full force and effect according to its terms. 

  

 Section 11.8 _Waivers and Amendments; Non Contractual Remedies; Preservation of Remedies_. This Agreement may be amended, superseded, canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. Except as provided in _Article X_, no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party may otherwise have at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such provision to any other Persons or circumstances. Upon such determination that any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   #####

 Section 11.11 _Interpretation_. 

  

       | a.  |   | For purposes of this Agreement, the words "
_hereof_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereby_ " and other words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
singular is used herein, the same shall include the plural, and whenever the
plural is used herein, the same shall include the singular, where
appropriate. All terms defined herein in the singular shall have the same
meaning when used in the plural; all terms defined herein in the plural shall
have the same meaning when used in the singular.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | With regard to each and every term and condition of this
Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that the same have or has been
mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if at any time the
Parties desire or are required to interpret or construe any such term or
condition or any agreement or instrument subject hereto, no consideration
shall be given to the issue of which Party actually prepared, drafted
or requested any term or condition of this Agreement.  
      
    | c.  |   | All references herein to Articles, Sections,
subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses shall be deemed references
to such parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise
require.  
      
    | d.  |   | All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the
masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may
require.  
      
    | e.  |   | The words " _include_ " and " _including_ " and
variations thereof shall not be deemed terms of limitation, but rather shall
be deemed to be followed by the words " _without limitation_."  
      
    | f.  |   | All financial accounting terms not specifically defined
herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | g.  |   | For purposes of this agreement, the word "
_primarily_ " shall mean used for the specified purpose to a greater extent
than for any other purpose.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 10.2_, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties, their successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. 

  

 Section 11.13 _Trustee Exculpation_. Each trustee executing this Agreement is executing the same solely in his capacity as a trustee of one or more of the Trusts. All obligations and liabilities of any trustee executing this Agreement shall be satisfied solely out of the assets of the trust or trusts on whose behalf such trustee is executing this Agreement, and such trustee shall not be personally liable for the satisfaction of any of such obligations or liabilities as a result of his execution of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 Section 11.15 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.16 _Available Remedies_. Each Party expressly agrees that, consistent with its intention and agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to the performance or satisfaction of the conditions precedent, the remedy of specific performance shall be available to a non-breaching and non-defaulting Party to enforce performance of this Agreement by a breaching or defaulting Party, including, without limitation, to require the consummation of the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_. It is understood and agreed that injury and damages incurred by any non-breaching and non-defaulting Party due to the breach or default of the other Party would be irreparable and not adequately compensable by monetary damages. Consequently, the non-breaching and non-defaulting Party will not have an adequate remedy at law for any failure by a breaching or defaulting Party to perform its obligations hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
