This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ "), dated
November 4, 2015, is by and among Expedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), HMS 1 Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ ") and HomeAway, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Annex A_ or as otherwise
defined elsewhere in this Agreement, unless the context clearly provides
otherwise. Parent, Purchaser and the Company are each sometimes referred to
herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Purchaser shall commence an exchange offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire any (subject to the Minimum Condition) and all of the
outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ " or, such shares, " _Company Shares_ ") for the
consideration and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, the Parties wish to effect the acquisition of the
Company by Parent through (a) the merger of Purchaser with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the " _First
Merger_ ") and (b) immediately following the First Merger, the merger of the
Company, as the surviving corporation of the First Merger, with and into
Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation of such merger (the "
_Second Merger_ " and, together with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ ");

WHEREAS, the First Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and will be effected
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the Second Merger will be governed by Section 253 of the DGCL;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Offer and the Mergers, taken together,
will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code;

WHEREAS, in connection with the First Merger, each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than any
Cancelled Shares, Converted Shares, Dissenting Shares or Company Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the
Offer) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL;

 



-1- WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board
of Directors_ ") unanimously (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ "), including
the Offer, the First Merger and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
in connection therewith, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ "), (ii) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders
and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (iii) approved the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein and
the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers and the other Transactions upon
the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ");

WHEREAS, the boards of directors or sole member, as applicable, of Parent and
Purchaser have unanimously approved this Agreement and determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Mergers and the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Offer and the First Merger, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Purchaser and
their respective stockholders; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Mergers and
also prescribe various terms of and conditions to the Offer and the Mergers.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ , as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (but in no event more than twenty (20) business days thereafter),
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer. In
the Offer, each Company Share accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for the
right to receive (i) $10.15 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii)
0.2065 of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the
Cash Consideration, the " _Offer Consideration_ "), subject to the other
provisions of this Article I. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to
purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of
the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the Exchange Act and contains the
terms and conditions set forth

 



-2-  in this Agreement and in _Annex B_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there being
validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer
a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned
by Parent and Purchaser (if any) (excluding Company Shares tendered pursuant
to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received," as such
term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer
pursuant to such procedures), represents at least a majority of all then
outstanding Company Shares (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex B_.

 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole discretion, Purchaser may not (and Parent shall
not permit Purchaser to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, or any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F)(4), (F)(5) or
(F)(6) of _Annex B_ (provided that Parent shall (and shall cause the Purchaser
to) waive the condition set forth in clause (F)(4) or clause (F)(5) of _Annex
B_ upon the written request of the Company), or (ii) make any change in the
terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration
to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the consideration in the Offer or the
number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other
than in a manner required or permitted by the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)_
or  _Section 9.1(b)_, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than those
set forth in _Annex B_ , or (E) amends or modifies any other term of or
condition to the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the holders of
Company Shares.

(c) _Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of
Company Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all
Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn)
by such holder) will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to
such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ the
Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest cent.

 

(d) _Adjustments to the Offer_. The Offer Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, Company Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer.
Nothing in this _Section 1.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

 



-3- (e) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, on the
date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after
the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer
shall expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so
extended.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer or the Mergers; and

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer (including the
Minimum Condition) have not been satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) business
days each in order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer
(including the Minimum Condition);

 

 _provided, however_ , that (1) any such extension shall not be deemed to
impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article IX and
(2) Purchaser shall not be required (and Parent shall not be required to cause
Purchaser) to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_ and _Section 9.1(b)_ without the
prior written consent of the Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day)
after such termination of this Agreement.

(f) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms of and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause

 



-4-  Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that are
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
_Section 1.1(e)(ii)_) (or, at Parents election, concurrently with the
expiration of the Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
waived) (such time, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of Parent Common Stock
necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that without the prior
written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment, or
pay for, any Company Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less
than the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition.
The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each Company Share
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the holder thereof in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes payable
in respect thereof. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of
Company Shares accepted for payment effective immediately after the Acceptance
Time.

 

(g) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents; Form S-4_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is first commenced (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall:

(1) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which
Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, and other customary
ancillary documents, in each case, in respect of the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

 

(2) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the
Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;

(3) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

 

(4) subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 1.2_, cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company Shares as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act.

 



-5- (ii) Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents, Parent shall file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the
Securities Act, the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the First Merger (the " _Form S-4_ "). The Form S-4 will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule
14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(iii) The Offer Documents and the Form S-4 may include a description of the
determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of
Directors set forth in _Section 1.2(a)_ that relate to the Offer. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities
Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4, if the Form S-4 is declared effective by the
SEC, effective for so long as necessary to complete the First Merger. The
Company shall furnish in writing to Parent and Purchaser all
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required by
applicable Law to be included in the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 so as to
enable Parent and Purchaser to comply with their obligations under this
_Section 1.1(g)_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in good
faith to determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary to
include in the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 in order to satisfy applicable
Laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it or any of its respective Representatives for use in
the Offer Documents or the Form S-4 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Unless the
Company Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation to the
extent permitted by Sections 6.3(d) and _(e)_ , Parent and Purchaser shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents and the Form S-4, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of
Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws,
or by the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq. Unless the Company Board of Directors
has effected a Change of Recommendation to the extent permitted by Sections
6.3(d) and _(e)_ , Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
and the Form S-4 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any reasonable
comments made by the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the
Company and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). Unless the Company Board of Directors has effected a
Change of Recommendation to the extent permitted by Sections 6.3(d) and _(e)_
, Parent and Purchaser shall provide in writing to the Company and its
counsel any and all written comments or other material communications that
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 promptly after such receipt,
and Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which Parent and Purchaser
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any reasonable comments
made by the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the Company and
its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably
practicable)) and to participate in any

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 3.1. _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or holders of any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to
_Section 1.1(a)_ and any applicable withholding Tax, each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other
than any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer
Consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to the provisions of
this _Article III_. From and after the First Effective Time, all such Company
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the applicable portion of Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_, including the right to
receive, pursuant to Section 3.6, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "),
together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 3.2(f).

(b) _Certain Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, each Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or is owned by Parent or
Purchaser shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the " _Cancelled
Shares_ "). At the First Effective Time, each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective time that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent (other than
Purchaser) or of the Company shall be converted into such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by the
closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq on the business
day immediately prior to the date hereof and (B) the Stock Consideration (such
Company Shares, the " _Converted Shares_ ").

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the First Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the First

 



-11-  Effective Time, all certificates representing Purchaser Shares shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the First Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or
holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of Parent, (i)
each share of capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of such
capital stock of Parent and (ii) all shares of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any consideration being payable
therefor.

(e) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time.
Nothing in this _Section 3.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby. At or immediately after the First
Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Common
Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under Section 3.2(f) (such
evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
Company Shares; _provided_ that no such deposits shall be required to be made
with respect to any Dissenting Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient (other than as a result of payment of the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Agreement) to pay the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under
_Section 3.2(f)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the
shortfall that is required to make such payment. Parent

 



-12-  shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional
Share Consideration, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited
to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial
paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent on the earlier
of (A) one (1) year after the First Effective Time or (B) the full payment of
the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented outstanding
Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_") and whose Company Shares
were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to _Section 3.1_, including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.6, and any amounts that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(f) for each Company Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made
available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder)

 



-13-  promptly following the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not required
to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the First Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_ ,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with  _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_, without
interest thereon.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the First Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first anniversary of the First Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Parent or the Exchange

 



-14-  Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent, an indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_ hereof, including any amount
payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with 
_Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the First Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 3.3. _Dissenter s Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not
tendered in the Offer and has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled to payment for such shares determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL; _ provided, however_, that if, after the First
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Company
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the First
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



-15- Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, each vested Company Stock Option (including
any Company Stock Options that vest as of the First Effective Time) that
remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (a " _Vested Option_ "), shall without any action on the part of Parent,
the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall
become a right to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably
practicable after the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Net Share covered by such Vested Option, less applicable Tax
withholdings;  _provided_ that, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, any
fractional Net Share (after aggregating all shares represented by all Vested
Options held by such individual) shall be settled in cash based on the Per
Share Cash Equivalent Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings. The
applicable Taxes required to be withheld shall reduce the cash portion and the
stock portion of the Merger Consideration in proportion to the value of the
Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration in the Merger so that the holder
of a Vested Option shall receive the same proportion of Cash Consideration and
Stock Consideration per Net Share (excluding any fractional Net Share) as
holders of shares of Company Common Stock purchased in the Merger for the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, with the value of
the stock portion for purposes of such deduction determined based on the
Parent Trading Price.

 

(b) At the First Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective time and
does not vest as a result of the occurrence of the First Effective Time (an "
_Unvested Option_ "), shall without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and converted automatically into
an option to purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "
_Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole
share. Each Adjusted Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to (i) the per share exercise price for shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the corresponding Unvested Option immediately prior to
the First Effective Time divided by (ii)

 



-16-  the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each
Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Unvested Option under the Company Equity Plan
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting. It is the
intention of the parties that the assumption of Unvested Options pursuant to
this Section shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of
Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and this _Section 3.4(b)_ shall be construed consistent with this
intent.

 

(c) At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that will vest as of the
First Effective Time (a " _Vested RSU_ ") shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the
holder of such Vested RSU becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction
of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested RSU
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, less applicable Tax
withholding. The applicable Taxes required to be withheld shall reduce the
cash portion and the stock portion of the Merger Consideration in proportion
to the value of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration in the Merger
so that the holder of a Vested RSU shall receive the same proportion of Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration per share as holders of shares of
Company Common Stock purchased in the Merger for the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, with the value of the stock portion
for purposes of such deduction determined based on the Parent Trading Price.
Any holder of a Vested RSU who becomes entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by all
Company RSUs held by such individual) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price, less any
applicable Tax withholding, payable in accordance with _Section 3.4(i)_.

(d) At the First Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU (an "
_Unvested RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and does not vest as a result of the occurrence of the First
Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into a restricted
stock unit with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an
" _Adjusted RSU_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested RSU
immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. Each
Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Company RSU under the Company Equity Plan and
the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting.

 

(e) At the First Effective Time, each Company RSA that is outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that will vest as of the
First Effective Time (a " _Vested RSA_ ") shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the
holder of such Vested RSA becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction
of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration
in respect

 



-17-  of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested RSA immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, less applicable Tax withholdings. The
applicable Taxes required to be withheld shall reduce the cash portion and
the stock portion of the Merger Consideration in proportion to the value of
the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration in the Merger so that the
holder of a Vested RSA shall receive the same proportion of
Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration per share as holders of shares of
Company Common Stock purchased in the Merger for the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, with the value of the stock portion for
purposes of such deduction determined based on the Parent Trading Price. Any
holder of a Vested RSA who becomes entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by all
Company RSAs held by such individual) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price, less any
applicable Tax withholding, payable in accordance with  _Section 3.4(i)_.

(f) At the First Effective Time, each unvested Company RSA that is outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and does not vest as a result
of the occurrence of the First Effective Time (an " _Unvested RSA_ ") shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof,
be assumed and converted automatically into a restricted stock award with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
RSA_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested RSA immediately prior
to the First Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSA
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
corresponding Company RSA under the Company Equity Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting.

 

(g) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as
are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated
by this _Section 3.4_.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the application of
_Sections 3.4(a)_ through _(f)_ is subject to the Laws of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction, then to the extent that the manner in which such Company Equity
Award would otherwise be treated pursuant to this Agreement would result in a
violation of Law or a materially adverse Tax consequence to the individual
holding such Company Equity Award, the Company and Parent shall work in good
faith to adjust the treatment of such Company Equity Award to the extent
necessary to comply with such Law or as commercially reasonable to avoid such
adverse Tax consequence to the extent practicable and in such a manner as to
yield to the holder of such Company Equity Award the economic benefit intended
by _Sections 3.4(a)_ through _(f)_ , as applicable; _provided_ , that, any
such Company Equity Awards that are treated differently as a result of the
foregoing shall remain subject to all other applicable terms of this Agreement
and _provided further_ that in no event shall any such Company Equity Award
remain outstanding following the First Effective Time. Parent and the Company
shall agree at least ten (10) days prior to the First Effective Time to the
treatment of any Company Equity Award that will be treated in a manner other
than prescribed by _Sections 3.4(a)_ through _(f)_ , as applicable, as a
result of the application of this Section 3.4(h).

 



-18- (i) Any cash payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be made
through Parents payroll system no later than fourteen (14) calendar days
after the First Effective Time.

(j) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than five (5) business days
after the First Effective Time, a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent
such form is available, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to the Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or statements for so long as Adjusted Options,
Adjusted RSUs, and Adjusted RSAs remaining outstanding.

Section 3.5. _Withholding_. Parent, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

Section 3.6. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the First
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent
Trading Price, rounded to the nearest cent.

material Company Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Benefit Plans_ " means each employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each bonus, stock, stock
option or other equity-based compensation arrangement or plan, incentive,
deferred compensation, retirement or supplemental retirement, severance,
employment, change-in-control, collective bargaining, profit sharing,
pension, vacation, cafeteria, dependent care, medical care, employee
assistance program, education or tuition assistance programs, and each
insurance and other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement, in each case, for the benefit of current employees,
directors or consultants (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates or with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or may have any
obligation or liability (whether actual or

 



-26-  contingent). With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, the Company
has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of (or, to the extent
no such copy exists, a description of), in each case, to the extent
applicable, (i) all plan documents, summary plan descriptions, summaries of
material modifications, and amendments related to such plans and any related
trust agreement; (ii) the most recent Form 5500 Annual Report; (iii) the most

with applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code and in
each case the regulations thereunder. No liability under Title IV of ERISA
that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole has been incurred by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been
satisfied in full, and to the knowledge of the Company no condition exists
that is likely to cause the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their

-48- Section 6.3. _Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, and except as otherwise specifically provided for
in this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall not (and shall cause the
Company Subsidiary not to), and that it shall not authorize its
directors, officers, employees and other Representatives to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such persons not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of providing information) any inquiry, proposal or offer,
or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer
which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or
otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (v) if
an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, fail to publicly
recommend against any such Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days
of the request of Parent and reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
such ten (10) business day period upon such request, (vi) enter into any
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, reorganization agreement, letter of
intent or similar agreement or document relating to, or any other agreement or
commitment providing for, any Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and
(vii) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv) and (v))
above, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees
and other Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any parties (or provision of any nonpublic
information to any parties) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the
date hereof, the Company shall request that each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a
potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or return to the Company all
non-public information relating to such Acquisition Proposal or to the
Company or its businesses or assets heretofore furnished by the Company or any
of its Representatives to such Person or group or any of its representatives
in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement. For purposes
of this _Section 6.3_, the term " _Person_ " means any Person or "group," as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the
Company, Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives may in
any event inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company,
is considering making an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this
_Section 6.3_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_,
which the Company Board of Directors determines in

 



-49-  good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and in each case that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then in either event the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any proposals or inquiries
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected
to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and
the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature
of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including
copies of all written requests, proposals, correspondence or offers, including
proposed agreements received by the Company. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material
terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms)
of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of
any information requested of the Company with respect thereto. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent any material nonpublic information
concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company determines to
begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_. Unless this
Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Company
shall not take any action to exempt any Person other than Parent and Purchaser
from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable
Takeover Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has determined
in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, which the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company Board
of Directors has determined in 

 



-50-  good faith after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (that is not related to an actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal) that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not known by the Company Board of
Directors as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of
Recommendation and at the end of such three (3) business day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under _Section
6.3(d)(i)_ (after taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent), or
(ii) under  _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with
three (3) business days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company
Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any
proposed definitive agreement, and during such three (3) business day period,
the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers)
to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
and at the end of such three (3) business day period the Company Board of
Directors again makes the determination under _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_ (after
taking into account the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to
_Section 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any material amendments, revisions or
changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to
the amount, form or mix of consideration the Companys stockholders would
receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), the Company shall notify
Parent of each such material revision in compliance with _Section 6.3(c)_ and
the applicable three (3) business day period shall be extended until at least
two (2) business days after the time that Parent receives notification from
the Company of each such material revision and the Company Board of Directors
shall not make a Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any such period
as so extended in accordance with the terms of this  _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender or exchange offer, or (ii)
making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors
has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall
not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_.

 

(g) References in this _Section 6.3_ to the " _Company Board of Directors_ "
shall mean the Company Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a
committee thereof.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 7.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the First Effective Time or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section
9.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to afford to the other Party and to
the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, Contracts, personnel, books and records and, during such
period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish
reasonably promptly to the other Party all information (financial or
otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required by this _Section 7.1_ to provide the
other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do
so, to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access
or disclosure not in violation of such consent requirement), (B) the
disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the withholding Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of any Law or duty) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and information
shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent
to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable
Antitrust Laws. Each of the Company and Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other
Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply
with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



-52- (c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers or other Transactions, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Mergers or the other Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent
could be material to the Company or Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding
commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
controlled affiliates, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Offer, the Mergers or any other Transaction, and
(iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in Annex B or give rise to any right
to terminate under _Article IX_.

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Mergers and the other Transactions as soon
as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable
after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Mergers or
any of the other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary,

and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (x) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within ten (10) business days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a
later date is mutually agreed between the Parties), and to supply as promptly
as practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR

 



-53-  Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, and (y) make all other necessary filings as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable
and advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested under any Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 7.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by promptly providing copies
to the other Party of any such written communications, and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (iii)
permit the other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives
to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive
telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any
other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party
the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings,
substantive telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials
required to be provided pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) may be redacted (A)
to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements,
and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the provisions of _Section
7.2(a)_ and _(b)_ , if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Mergers, pursuant to the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Mergers, each of Parent, Purchaser and Parents other Subsidiaries
will offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that neither
Parent, Purchaser nor any of Parents other Subsidiaries shall be required to
offer, negotiate, commit to, effect, or accept any of the actions specified in
_Section 7.2(c)(A)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(B)_ if any such action,
individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

 



-54-  whole. In addition, Parent, Purchaser and Parents other Subsidiaries shall
use reasonable best efforts to contest, defend and appeal any legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Mergers.

 

Section 7.3. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Offer, the Mergers or this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines,
after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable
Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national
securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the Offer, the
Mergers or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity
to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement in advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be required by this  _Section 7.3_ to provide any
such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence
of an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Recommendation and matters related
thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties shall not be required by
this _Section 7.3_ to provide any such review or comment to the other Party
relating to any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their respective affiliates and
Representatives may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the
Company in compliance with this _Section 7.3_.

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in
respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior
to the First Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer, the Mergers or any of the other Transactions), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, in connection with
such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law and 

 



-55-  provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent prior to
the date hereof. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective
Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their
respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the First Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of
which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.4_,
the provisions of this  _Section 7.4_ shall continue in effect with respect
to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 

(b) For six (6) years after the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in, except to the extent such agreement
provides for an earlier termination, any other agreements of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date
of this Agreement, copies of all of which have been provided to Parent prior
to the date hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers or any of the
other Transactions).

(c) The Company shall, prior to the First Effective Time, purchase a single
premium tail coverage policy with respect to the Companys current directors
and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage
for events occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") with a one-time cost not in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for
the DandO Insurance;  _provided_ that if the Company shall not be able to
obtain such tail policy prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, for
an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the First Effective
Time, DandO Insurance that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. In addition, at the written request of Parent, to the extent
available the Company shall, prior to the First Effective Time, purchase a
single premium tail coverage policy with respect to the Companys current
errors and omissions insurance policies that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the " _Errors and Omissions
Insurance_ ") with a one-time cost not in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for
the Errors and Omissions Insurance.

 



-56- (d) In the event Parent or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section 7.4_
shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Mergers and shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Offer, the
Mergers and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the
Mergers and the other Transactions. Unless this Agreement is otherwise
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, no Change of Recommendation shall
change, or be deemed to change, the approval of the Company Board of Directors
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the
Mergers or any of the other Transactions.

Section 7.6. _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser and the First Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Mergers, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.7. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement or as subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms
of such Company Benefit Plans and this Agreement. As a result of the Mergers,
each of the current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
become employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_
") by operation of Law. Effective as of the First Effective Time and for a
period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent shall (x) maintain the
aggregate total compensation opportunity (i.e., base salary, base hourly wage
and target cash bonus opportunity) of each Continuing Employee, and (y) to
provide employee benefits (other than severance and equity compensation) no
less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits (other than severance and
equity compensation) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements for the benefit of such Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents and beneficiaries, that the Company or its Subsidiaries provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time.
Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide
that periods of employment with the Company (including any current or former
affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company) shall be taken
into account for all purposes under all employee benefit plans maintained by
Parent or an affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the 

 



-57-  Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-time-off plans or
arrangements, including the Companys U.S. "open vacation plan," 401(k) and
any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of
determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as
would result in a duplication of benefits).

 

(b) Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting
periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations
or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under the
applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the First Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing
Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not
applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and (iii) credit each
Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-
payments paid by such employee under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year.
The Mergers shall not affect any Continuing Employees accrual of, or right to
use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect immediately prior to the
First Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-off
accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the First
Effective Time.

 

(c) If, at least ten (10) business days prior to the First Effective Time,
Parent provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to
terminate its 401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k)
plans effective as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the First
Effective Time occurs (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolution of the Companys Board of Directors at least two (2)
business days prior to the day on which the First Effective Time occurs. If
the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.7(c), then as
soon as practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall
permit all Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the
Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to
participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall permit each such Continuing
Employee to elect to transfer his or her account balance when distributed
from the terminated Company 401(k) plan, including any outstanding participant
loans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except to the extent accepting such transfers
would adversely affect the tax-qualified status of Parents 401(k) plan or as
may be prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

(d) In the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee serving in a
public company finance, public company legal or public company investor
relations role shall be terminated without cause at any time during the six
(6)-month period following the First Effective Time, such employee shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu of any other severance, (i)

 



-58-  continued base salary for three (3) months and an amount in cash equal to
the employer portion of health care premiums for three months, or, (ii) if
greater, the severance benefits such individual would be entitled to receive
pursuant to the table set forth on Exhibit A to _Schedule 6.1_ , subject, in
either case, to execution of a customary release of claims against Parent, the
Company and their Affiliates; _provided_  that this provision shall not apply
to any Continuing Employee who is entitled to severance under an individual
employment agreement.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly
provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Company or any
affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or
other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 7.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Parent or Purchaser or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or
former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries
or dependents thereof).

Section 7.8.  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent
equity securities pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.9. _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that Party
against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
directors relating to the Offer, the Mergers, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, and shall keep the other party informed on a prompt and timely
basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any such litigation, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
conducting the defense or settlement of such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent
shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a
full release of Parent and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief after the First Effective Time upon Parent or any of
its affiliates. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this _Section 7.9_ and _Section 6.1_ or _Section
7.2_, the provisions of this _Section 7.9_ shall control.

 



-59- Section 7.10. _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until after the First Effective Time.

Section 7.11. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed
by each director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and effective upon the First Effective Time.

 

Section 7.12. _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer and the Mergers, taken together,
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, including by executing and delivering customary tax representation
letters to the Companys and/or Parents counsel, as applicable, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, in connection with (i) any
tax opinion or description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Offer and the Mergers contained or set forth in the Form S-4 or (ii) the tax
opinions referenced in clauses (F)(5)(i) and (F)(5)(ii) of _Annex B_. None of
the Parties shall (and each of the Parties shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to take any action, that
could reasonably be expected to cause the Offer and the Mergers, taken
together, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties intend to report and, except to the
extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for federal income tax
purposes, the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 7.13. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First
Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

Section 7.14. _14d-10 Matters_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments
have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or
are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Shares
and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (A) at a
meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt resolutions
approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act
(1) each Arrangement presented to the Company Compensation Committee on or
prior to the date hereof, (2) the treatment of the Company Equity Awards, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, and (3)
the terms of _Section 7.4_ and _Section 7.7_, and (B) will take all other
actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing
arrangements. The Company represents and warrants that each member of the
Company Compensation Committee is an "independent director" in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 



-60- Section 7.15. _Convertible Senior Notes_. As promptly as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger Subs, Parent and the
Company shall prepare any supplemental indenture(s) (each a " _Supplemental
Indenture_ ") as required by Sections 11.01 and 14.07 of the indenture, dated
as of March 31, 2014 (the " _Indenture_ "), by and among the Company and U.S.
Bank National Association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), governing the
0.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the " _Convertible Senior Notes_ ")
of the Company. On the Closing Date, Purchaser, Parent and the Company, as
required, shall execute with the Trustee any such Supplemental Indenture(s)
and, in each case, deliver any required certificates, legal opinions and
other documents required by the Indenture to be delivered in connection with
such Supplemental Indenture(s). The Company shall deliver all notices and take
all other actions required under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes,
the Indenture, the Note Hedges and the Warrants; provided, however, that the
Company will provide copies of such notice to Parent at least three (3)
business days prior to delivering any such notice or taking any such action.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with Parent and Purchaser in connection with the fulfillment of the
Companys obligations under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, the
Indenture, the Note Hedges and the Warrants at any time after the date of this
Agreement as reasonably requested by Parent.

 

Section 7.16. _Financing Cooperation_. (a) Prior to the First Effective Time,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, provide all
customary cooperation, including provision of customary financial information,
that is reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in connection with
any third-party debt financing obtained by Parent or Purchaser for the
purpose of financing the Mergers (it being understood that the receipt of any
such debt financing is not a condition to the Mergers); provided, however,
that (i) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent it would (A)
unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the Companys business, (B) require the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other
liability prior to the First Effective Time for which it is not promptly
reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified, (C) cause any representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached, (D) cause any condition to Closing
to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or
(E) be reasonably expected to cause any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any material personal liability and
(ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to
execute any credit or security documentation or similar agreement prior to the
First Effective Time.

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, cooperate with
Parent and Purchaser in connection with (i) the replacement, backstopping or
amendment, as of the First Effective Time, of outstanding financial
guaranties, letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds and other
similar instruments and obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, including granting any waivers in respect thereof
and facilitating the migration of such financial products to the facilities
of Parent or its affiliates and (ii) the satisfaction or amendment, as of the
First Effective Time, of derivative financial instruments or arrangements
(including the Note Hedges,

 



-61-  as well as other swaps, caps, floors, futures, forward contracts and option
agreements), in each case as reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall
reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 7.16(b)_.

ARTICLE VIII

 

CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS

 

Section 8.1. _Conditions to Each Party s Obligations to Effect the Mergers_.
The respective obligations of each Party to effect the Mergers shall be

following conditions, any and all of which may be waived in whole or in part
by Parent, Purchaser and the Company, as the case may be, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law:

(a) _Purchase of Shares of Company Common Stock_. Purchaser shall have
accepted for payment all of the Company Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

(b) _No Legal Prohibition_. No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction

which has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Mergers.

 

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer,
the Mergers and the other Transactions may be abandoned, at any time before
the Acceptance Time, as follows (with any termination by Parent also being an
effective termination by Purchaser):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) Parent and/or Purchaser shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated their respective covenants or
agreements under this Agreement in any material respect, or (B) any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall have become inaccurate, which inaccuracy (without giving
effect to any qualification as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect contained therein) would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, in each of clauses (A) and (B) to the extent such
breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is incapable of being
cured, or is not cured by Parent and/or Purchaser within the earlier of (x)
thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from the
Company of such breach, failure to perform,

 



-62-  violation or inaccuracy or (y) the then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer (provided, for purposes of this clause (y), Parent may irrevocably
extend the expiration date of the Offer to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day
after the written notice contemplated in clause (x) in order to extend the
cure period to thirty (30) calendar days);

 

(c) by Parent, in the event that (i) neither Parent nor Purchaser is then in
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) the Company shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, or (B) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of
clauses (A) or (B) in a manner that would give rise to the failure of any of
the conditions to the Offer set forth in clause (F)(1) or (F)(2) of _Annex B_
and such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable
of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the
Outside Date, is not cured by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days
following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach, failure to
perform, violation or inaccuracy;

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer
without Purchaser having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer by midnight, Eastern Standard Time, on May 4, 2016 (the
" _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to
any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been a proximate cause of (i) any of the conditions to the
Offer set forth in _Annex B_ having failed to be satisfied and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement or (ii) the
expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Offer without Purchaser having accepted for payment any
Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and such action or failure to
act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

 

(e) by Parent, if, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board of
Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation;  _provided_ that
Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_
shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the tenth (10th) business
day following the date on which such Change of Recommendation occurs;

(f) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,
decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the Mergers; or

 

(g) by the Company in order to effect a Change of Recommendation and enter
into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, provided that
(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with the terms of
_Section 6.3(e)(ii)_ and (ii) immediately prior (and as a condition) to the
termination of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent the Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_.

 



-63- Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 10.3_ through _Section 10.12_ shall survive such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall relieve any Party
from liability for a Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in _Section
9.2(b)_.

 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_, or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_ as a result of the Company having breached, failed to perform or
violated it covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (B) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn
(without qualification) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date
of such termination, and (C) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated within
twelve (12) months of such termination or a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into within twelve (12) months of such
termination and such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, within two (2)
business days after the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated
the Company shall pay a fee of $138,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_
") to Parent. Solely for purposes of this _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
_Annex A_ , except that all references to "20%" and "80%" therein shall be
deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, within
two (2) business days after such termination, the Company shall pay or cause
to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
9.1(g)_, contemporaneously with such termination, the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the

 



-64-  expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the
collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any related
claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to
Parent interest on the amount payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon Parents receipt of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, none of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions, other than with respect to the
Company only, in the event of a Willful Breach as described in _Section
9.2(a)_.

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer and the Mergers is not affected in any manner adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
