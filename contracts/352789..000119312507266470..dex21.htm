Shares to be issued to the Selling Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.2,

(ii) Within 15 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Selling Shareholders a written statement, signed by the Chief

Date (excluding any Option Shares).

(iii) __" _Options_ " means all options issued and outstanding under the
Buyer Stock Plans as of the Closing Date.

(iv) __" _Option Shares_ " means the aggregate number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Options (whether or not vested) as
of the Closing Date.

(v) __" _Treasury Method Amount_ " means the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the difference of (A) the product of (1)
the number of Option Shares, _multiplied by_ (2) the Trailing Average,
_minus_ (B) an amount equal to the sum of the product calculated for each
outstanding Option (on an Option-by-Option basis) of (1) the number of Option
Shares subject to an Option ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any Option with
an exercise price greater than the Trailing Average shall not be included in
this calculation), _multiplied by_ (2) the exercise price for such Options,
_divided by_  (y) the Trailing Average.

(vi) __" _Trailing Average_ " means the 20 Trading Day average closing price
for one share of Buyer Common Stock ending two Trading Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(vii)  __" _Trading Day_ " means any day on which shares of Buyer Common
Stock are traded on the NYSE.

(c) Adjustment of Consideration Shares. In the event there is a difference
between the number of Consideration Shares set forth in the Preliminary
Closing Calculation and the Revised Closing Calculation, then Buyer or the
Selling Shareholders, as applicable, shall issue or transfer shares of Buyer
Common Stock to the other, as follows:

(i)  _Shortfall Consideration Shares_. Within ten calendar days of the date
of the final determination of the Revised Closing Calculation pursuant to
Section 1.3(a), to the extent the number of Consideration Shares set forth in
the Revised Closing Calculation is less than the number of Consideration
Shares set forth in the Preliminary Closing Calculation, Buyer shall issue to
the Selling Shareholders, for no additional consideration, a number of shares
of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Buyer
Common Stock equal to such difference, in accordance with the allocation set
forth in Section 1.2(a) and (b).

(ii) _Excess Consideration Shares_. Within ten calendar days of the date of
the final determination of the Revised Closing Calculation pursuant to
Section 1.4(a), to the extent the number of Consideration Shares set forth in
the Revised Closing Calculation is greater than the number of Consideration
Shares set forth in the Preliminary Closing Calculation, the Selling
Shareholders shall transfer and assign to Buyer, for no consideration, a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to such difference, in accordance
with the allocation set forth in Section 1.2(a) and (b).

 Section 1.5 Tax Treatment and Elections. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that it is the Parties intent that (i) the Transactions shall be treated as
taxable transactions for purposes of the Code and (ii) Buyer shall file an
election with the IRS to have the provisions of Section 338(g) of the Code ("
_Section 338 Election_ ") apply to the Transactions. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer shall be responsible for and control the preparation and
filing of such Section 338 Election (the form of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Selling Shareholders), and the Selling Shareholders shall
cooperate as reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation
and filing of such Section 338 Election.

and (b); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) no such notification will affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement and (ii) a failure to comply with this Section
6.11 will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied unless the underlying Buyer Material Adverse Effect, Operating
Company Material Adverse Effect or breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

 Section 6.12 Legal Conditions to Transactions.

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions

Date. Neither the Top Level Operating Companies or any Subsidiary Operating
Company shall be required to (x) divest any of their respective businesses,
product lines or assets, or (y) take or agree to take any other action or
agree to any limitation that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to the Operating Companies,
collectively.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in Sections 6.4, 6.5 or 6.12(a), if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any applicable Legal
Requirement or legal obligation or requirement, or if any statute, rule,
regulation or Order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Body that would make the Transactions illegal or would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, each of Buyer and Selling Shareholder will cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any judgment or Order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions and to have such statute, rule, regulation
or Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation
of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.12(b) will limit either Buyers or

entitled to indemnification or any other remedy pursuant to this Article IX,
the Indemnitee shall promptly give the indemnifying Party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim or Legal Proceeding (a "
_Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure on the part of the
Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the
Indemnitees rights to indemnification under this Article IX (except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal
Proceeding).

(b) Within ten (10) days of delivery of such written notice, the Indemnifying
Party may elect (by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee) to take all
necessary steps to properly contest any Claim involving third parties or to
prosecute such Claim to conclusion or settlement, so long as the Indemnitee
agrees on the selection of legal counsel for the matter. If the Indemnifying
Party makes the foregoing election, an Indemnitee will have the right to
participate at its own expense in all proceedings. If the Indemnifying Party
does not make such election within such period or fails to diligently contest
such Claim after such election, then the Indemnitee shall be free to handle
the prosecution or defense of any such Claim, and will take all necessary
steps to contest the Claim involving third parties or to prosecute such Claim
to conclusion or settlement, and will notify the Indemnifying Party of the
progress of any such Claim, will permit the Indemnifying Party at its sole
cost to participate in such prosecution or defense and will provide the
Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to all relevant information and
documentation relating to the Claim and the prosecution or defense thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.5(b), if a Claim includes Damages
likely to exceed the value of the limitation set forth in Section 9.2(b) or
9.3(b), as applicable on the date of the Claim, or relates to any
Intellectual Property or Governmental Body issues, the Indemnitee shall have
the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such Claim or Legal
Proceeding on its own. In any case, the Party not in control of the Claim will
cooperate with the other Party in the conduct of the prosecution or defense
of such Claim.

(d) In connection with a Claim where (i) the Indemnitee has assumed the
prosecution or defense of such Claim, the Indemnitee shall not settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise such Claim for which it is
indemnified by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party and (ii) where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
prosecution or defense of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise such Claim for which it is
required to indemnify the Indemnitee without the written consent of the
Indemnitee.

payment made pursuant to this Article IX as a purchase price adjustment unless
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

election) (A) pay to Selling Shareholders in proportion to their allocation
of Consideration Shares under Article I an amount in cash equal to such
indemnification claim or (B) issue to Selling Shareholders in proportion to
their allocation of Consideration Shares under Article I additional shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate dollar amount of the indemnification
payment obligation divided by the 10 Trading Day average closing price of
Buyer Common Stock ending on the applicable payment date; and

(ii) if the Indemnifying Party are Selling Shareholders, such Selling
Shareholders shall (at their election) (A) pay to Buyer and in proportion to
their allocation of Consideration Shares under Article I an amount in cash
equal to such indemnification claim or (B) surrender to Buyer in proportion to
their allocation of Consideration Shares under Article I an aggregate number
of Consideration Shares equal to the aggregate dollar amount of the
indemnification payment obligation divided by the 10 Trading Day average
closing price of Buyer Common Stock ending on the applicable payment date.

 Section 9.9 Process for Indemnification.

(a) Delivery of Claim Notice. If any Indemnitee has or claims to have
incurred or suffered Damages for which it is or may be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Article IX, such
Indemnitee may, on or prior to the last day of the Survival Period, deliver a
claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party. Each Claim
Notice shall state that such Indemnitee believes that there is or has been a
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
or that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under Article IX, and contain a brief description of the
circumstances supporting such Indemnitees belief that there is or has been
such a breach or that such Indemnitee is so entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement and shall, to the extent possible, contain a
good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the amount of Damages
such Indemnitee claims to have so incurred or suffered (the " _Claimed
Amount_ ").

(b) Response Notice; Uncontested Claims. Within forty-five (45) days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
may deliver to the Indemnitee who delivered the Claim Notice a written
response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Indemnifying Party: (i)
agrees to pay the full Claimed Amount; (ii) agrees to pay an amount equal to
part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ "); or (iii)
indicates that it objects to payment of the entire Claimed Amount. Any part of
the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be paid by the Indemnitee pursuant to
the Response Notice shall be the " _Contested Amount_ ". If a Response Notice
is not received by the Indemnitee within such 45-day period, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to pay the full
Claimed Amount.

(c) Uncontested Claims. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Response Notice
agreeing to pay the full Claimed Amount, or if the Indemnifying Party does
not deliver a Response Notice on a timely basis in accordance with Section
9.9(b), the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to make a payment in full
satisfaction of the Claim described in the Claim Notice within fifteen (15)
business days thereafter.

(d) Partially Contested Claims. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Response
Notice agreeing to pay less than the full Claimed Amount to the Indemnitee,
such payment shall be made within fifteen (15) business days thereafter and
shall not be deemed to be made in full satisfaction of the Claim described in
such Claim Notice, but shall count toward the satisfaction of the Claim
described in such Claim Notice.



 

48 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) Contested Claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee are unable
to resolve any dispute relating to any Contested Amount within forty-five
(45) days after the delivery of a Response Notice pursuant to which there is a
Contested Amount, then the Parties shall be entitled to resort to any legal
remedy under Section 10.8 available to such Party to resolve such dispute.

 Section 9.10 Reserve Amounts.

(a) From the Closing Date until end of the Survival Period (the " _Reserve
Period_ "), ExcelStor Group and ExcelStor Holdings shall maintain record
ownership of a number of Consideration Shares equal to the difference of (i)
US$6,000,000 based on the 10 Trading Day average closing price of Buyer
Common Stock ending on the Closing Date (the " _Reserve Amount_ ") _minus_
(ii) the value of any Claims paid by ExcelStor Group and ExcelStor Holdings
during the Reserve Period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement will prohibit ExcelStor Group and ExcelStor Holdings from
distributing to their shareholders a number of their Consideration Shares in
excess of such Reserve Amount.

prohibit ExcelStor Group and ExcelStor Holdings from distributing to their
shareholders any or all of their Consideration Shares.
