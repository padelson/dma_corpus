STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT



THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of May 30, 2018 (this "Agreement"), by
and among The Brink's Company, a Virginia corporation (the "Purchaser"),
Dunbar Armored, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), the stockholders
of the Company listed on Exhibit A hereto (individually, a "Seller" and,
collectively, the "Sellers"), and Kevin R. Dunbar solely in his capacity as
the representative of the Sellers hereunder (collectively, the "Sellers'
Representative"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section
10.1.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company (each individually a "Share" and, collectively, the
"Shares");

WHEREAS, the Sellers desire to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser
desires to purchase from the Sellers, the Shares, for the purchase price
amounts and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a material inducement to the Sellers' willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Purchaser has obtained the RandW Insurance Policy; and

WHEREAS, the Purchaser may determine that the sale of the Shares by Sellers to
the Purchaser hereunder shall qualify as a "qualified stock purchase" within
the meaning of Section 338(d) of the Code, and in such case the parties shall
make a joint election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect
to such qualified stock purchase upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth (the "338(h)(10) Election").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the terms
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as 

Article I 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE SHARES

1.1 Sale and Purchase of Shares Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, at the Closing, each Seller shall sell, assign, transfer,
convey and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase from
each Seller, the Shares owned by such Seller set forth opposite such Seller's
name on Exhibit A hereto, free and clear of all Liens.

1.2 Purchase Price. The initial purchase price for the Shares at Closing shall
be an amount equal to: (a) $519,750,000, plus (i) the amount, if any, by which
Estimated Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital, less (ii) the
amount, if any, by which Target Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working
Capital, and less (iii) the sum of (A) the amount of the Estimated Vault
Inventory Shortfall, if any, as determined pursuant to Section 1.5.2, and (B)
the ATM Inventory Holdback (the "Initial Purchase Price"). The Initial
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after Closing pursuant to the
terms of Section 1.4.9, Section 1.5.2 and Section 1.5.4 hereof (as adjusted
and finalized, the "Purchase Price"). The parties hereto have agreed that the
Purchase Price shall be allocated in an amount equal to $84,500,000 to the
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and the remainder to the holders of
the Class B Common Stock. The holders of shares of each class shall share in
these amounts pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of each such
class outstanding at the time of Closing. The Sellers and the Purchaser
understand, acknowledge and agree that the foregoing allocation of the
Purchase Price between the holders of the Class A Common Stock and the holders
of the Class B Common Stock is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, without such an allocation, the holders of
the Class A Common Stock would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

1.3 Payment of Initial Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall pay the Initial Purchase Price as follows:

1.3.1 the Purchaser shall pay from the Initial Purchase Price such amount as
necessary to pay in full, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, on
behalf of the Company, (a) the Debt Amount directly to the applicable
creditors in accordance with the pay-off letters and wire instructions
provided by the Sellers' Representative as set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement, and (b) the Transaction Expenses directly to the applicable third-
party in accordance with the wire instructions set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement;

1.3.2 the Purchaser shall pay $2,000,000 to the Sellers' Representative, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to hold as security on behalf of
the Sellers, for any payments required to be made to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.4.9; and

1.3.3 the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers' Representative for the benefit
of the Sellers the remaining Initial Purchase Price, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the account or accounts directed by the
Sellers' Representative and reflected in the Estimated Closing Statement. 

1.4 Net Working Capital Adjustment.

1.4.1 "Net Working Capital" means an amount equal to (i) the Company's current
assets set forth on Schedule 1.4.1, minus (ii) the Company's current
liabilities set forth on Schedule 1.4.1, in each case as determined in
accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the principles used
by the Company in the Financial Statements (to the extent consistent with
GAAP) and as modified in accordance with Schedule 1.4.1 (the "Accounting
Principles"). "Target Working Capital" shall mean $20,423,457. For example
purposes only, attached hereto as Schedule 1.4.1(b) is a schedule showing Net
Working Capital of the Company as of December 31, 2017, calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles.

1.4.2 On the Friday of the week prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Sellers' Representative will cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") containing (a) a
calculation of the Debt Amount, together with an itemized list of each Person
to whom any portion of the Debt Amount is owed, the portion of the Debt Amount
owed to each such Person and the wire account information for each such
Person), (b) an itemized list of all Transaction Expenses, together with the
name of each Person to whom any Transaction Expense is owed, the amount of the
Transaction Expense owed to each such Person and wire account information for
each such Person, and (c) a good faith estimate of Net Working Capital as of
the Effective Time ("Estimated Working Capital"). Promptly following
determination of the Estimated Vault Inventory Shortfall, if any, the
Estimated Closing Statement shall be updated to include a calculation of the
Initial Purchase Price, together with the portion of the Initial Purchase
Price payable to the Sellers' Representative for the benefit of the Sellers
pursuant to Section 1.3.3 hereof. The Estimated Closing Statement and the
calculations and determinations related thereto will be prepared in good faith
from the books and records of the Company (with Estimated Working Capital to
be calculated consistent with the Accounting Principles).

1.4.3 Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Sellers' Representative a draft detailed statement of Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles (the "Draft Net Working Capital Statement").

1.4.4 Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by the Sellers'
Representative of the Draft Net Working Capital Statement, the Sellers'
Representative shall notify the Purchaser in writing if it has any objections
thereto. The notice of objection must contain a statement describing the basis
of and reasons for the Sellers' Representative's objections in reasonable
detail and the amounts in dispute. The Sellers' Representative shall be deemed
to have accepted the Draft Net Working Capital Statement if it does not notify
the Purchaser of its objection within the period referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 1.4.4.

1.4.5 In connection with the Sellers' Representative's review of the Draft Net
Working Capital Statement, the Sellers' Representative and his Representatives
shall be provided with copies of all relevant work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents used or prepared by the Purchaser or its
Representatives, subject to customary indemnification and other agreements
that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser's Representatives in
connection with its preparation of the Draft Net Working Capital Statement and
any other information which the Sellers' 

Representative reasonably requests, and the Purchaser shall cooperate
reasonably with the Sellers' Representative and its Representatives in
connection therewith.

1.4.6 If the Sellers' Representative disputes the Draft Net Working Capital
Statement, the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall work
expeditiously and in good faith in an attempt to resolve such dispute within a
period of twenty (20) days after the date of notification by the Sellers'
Representative to the Purchaser of such dispute, failing which the dispute
shall be submitted for determination to Ernst and Young ("Accounting Referee").
The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final and binding upon
the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal, except where there
exists a discrepancy in excess of $500,000 between such determination and the
amount set forth in the Draft Net Working Capital Statement delivered by
Purchaser. The Accounting Referee shall (a) be deemed to be acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, (b) make determinations only in respect of
those items and amounts that are in dispute by the Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative and (c) deliver to the Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth its
determination.

1.4.7 Each of the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall bear the
fees and expenses of its preparation or review, as the case may be, of the
Draft Net Working Capital Statement. In the case of a dispute and the
retention of the Accounting Referee to resolve such dispute, the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be allocated ratably between the
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative in the same proportion as the
amounts by which their respective calculations of the amounts in dispute
differ from the calculations of the amounts in dispute by the Accounting
Referee bear to one another; provided, however, that each of the Sellers'
Representative and the Purchaser shall bear its own costs in presenting its
case to the Accounting Referee.

1.4.8 Immediately following the period referred to in Section 1.4.4 or the
resolution of any dispute in accordance with Section 1.4.6, as the case may
be, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative the final
statement of Net Working Capital as of the Closing that reflects the
resolution pursuant to Section 1.4.6, if applicable (the "Final Net Working
Capital Statement"). Such Final Net Working Capital Statement shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal.

1.4.9 If the Final Net Working Capital Statement amount is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, then the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such shortfall by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (to the bank account designated by the
Purchaser in writing at the time of the delivery of the Final Net Working
Capital Statement) within five (5) Business Days of the Seller's
Representative's receipt of the Final Net Working Capital Statement. If the
Final Net Working Capital Statement amount is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers' Representative
for the benefit of the Sellers an amount equal to such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (to the bank account or accounts
designated by the Sellers' Representative in writing at the time of the
delivery of the Final Net Working Capital Statement) within five (5) Business
Days of the Purchaser's receipt of the Final Net Working Capital Statement.

1.4.10 The determination and adjustment in accordance with this Section 1.4
shall be the Purchaser's sole remedy with respect to the adjustment of the
Purchase Price based on the 

Company's actual Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be entitled
to any duplicative indemnification, recovery or other form of relief for
Losses under Article IX in respect of any matter addressed in the Final Net
Working Capital Statement pursuant to this Section 1.4.

1.5 Cash and Coin Inventory.

1.5.1 On the Friday of the week following determination by the parties that
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1.7) and Section
7.2 have been satisfied or waived (or are capable of being satisfied at
Closing) (the "Administrative Report Date"), the Company shall produce a
report, based on information provided by the Company's customers (the
"Administrative Report") of the balances of cash and coins and the securities
and other assets of the Company's customers that the Company is holding in
custody for such customers (the "Customers' Valuables") in the Company's
vaults or cash processing areas (the "Vault Inventory"). Commencing at the
close of business on the Administrative Report Date, a joint inspection team
composed of representatives of the Sellers and the Purchaser will conduct a
physical count of the Vault Inventory (the "Physical Vault Inventory Count").
A detailed description of the procedures to be undertaken during the Physical
Vault Inventory Count (including an outline of the cash inventory verification
procedure) is contained in Schedule 1.5.1. Without prejudice to the contents
of Schedule 1.5.1, the following proceedings shall be observed with respect to
the performance of the Physical Vault Inventory Count: (i) the Physical Vault
Inventory Count will begin at the close of business on the Administrative
Report Date and will be performed on a continuous basis until its conclusion,
which shall be no later than the Sunday prior to the anticipated Closing Date
(the "Vault Inventory Completion"); (ii) the Physical Vault Inventory Count
will begin simultaneously at all locations where Vault Inventory is located;
and (iii) no Customers' Valuables will be allowed to enter or leave the
Company's vault or cash processing area over the duration of the Physical
Vault Inventory Count.

1.5.2 On the day of the Vault Inventory Completion, the Company and the
Purchaser shall compare the results of the Physical Vault Inventory Count and
Administrative Report and produce a statement detailing any shortfall in Vault
Inventory (the "Estimated Vault Inventory Shortfall"). Following the Closing,
the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly work with the
Company's customers to resolve any discrepancies covered by the Estimated
Vault Inventory Shortfall and, where necessary, the Purchaser will submit the
pertinent claims for losses to the insurer or insurers under the Company's
insurance policies covering such losses. Any negative variation settled,
inaccuracy in the Estimated Vault Inventory Shortfall, or insurance payment
received by the Company for claims made as described in the preceding
sentence, less the amount of any applicable insurance deductibles, will be
paid from the Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the
Sellers (to the bank account designated by the Sellers' Representative in
writing).

1.5.3 On the Closing Date, the Company shall produce a report, based on
information provided by the Company's customers (the "ATM Report") of the
balances of Customers' Valuables available at ATMs of the Company's customers
that are serviced by the Company (the "ATM Inventory"). On the Business Day
following the Closing Date, a joint 

inspection team composed of representatives of the Sellers and the Purchaser
will conduct a physical count of the ATM Inventory (the "Physical ATM
Inventory Count"). A detailed description of the procedures to be undertaken
during the Physical ATM Inventory Count is contained in Schedule 1.5.3.
Without prejudice to the provisions of Schedule 1.5.3, the following
proceedings shall be observed with respect to the performance of the Physical
ATM Inventory Count: (i) the Physical ATM Inventory Count will begin on the
first Business Day following the Closing Date; (ii) the parties will use
reasonable best efforts to conclude the Physical ATM Inventory Count within
twenty-one (21) days from the starting date (the date of completion of the
Physical ATM Inventory Count, the "ATM Inventory Completion"); (iii) the joint
inventory team will inventory all of the ATMs under the responsibility of the
Company; (iv) prior to the ATM Inventory Completion, the Company and the
Purchaser will jointly carry out the inventory of the consignments in transit
(all those consignments delivered by customers, which stay in a branch of the
Company overnight to be delivered on the next following day); (v) prior to the
ATM Inventory Completion, without the consent of the Sellers' Representative,
the Company and the Purchaser will not terminate any representative of the
Sellers' Representative conducting the Physical ATM Inventory Count; and (vi)
the remuneration, compensation and wages of representatives of the Sellers'
Representative conducting the Physical ATM Inventory Count shall be borne by
the Company and shall not constitute a Transaction Expense.

1.5.4 On the day of the ATM Inventory Completion, the Sellers' Representative
and the Purchaser shall compare the results of the Physical ATM Inventory
Count and ATM Report and produce a statement detailing any shortfall in ATM
Inventory (the "Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall"). To the extent that the
Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall is greater than the ATM Inventory Holdback,
within five (5) Business Days of the ATM Inventory Completion, the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall pay the amount by which the
Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall exceeds the ATM Inventory Holdback to the
Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Purchaser in writing. To the extent that the ATM Inventory
Holdback exceeds the Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall, within five (5)
Business Days of the ATM Inventory Completion, the Purchaser shall pay the
amount by which the ATM Inventory Holdback exceeds the Estimated ATM Inventory
Shortfall to the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Sellers' Representative in writing. Following the ATM Inventory Completion,
the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly work with the
Company's customers to resolve any discrepancies covered by the Estimated ATM
Inventory Shortfall and, where necessary, the Purchaser will submit the
pertinent claims for losses to the insurer or insurers under the Company's
insurance policies covering such losses. Any negative variation settled,
inaccuracy in the Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall, or insurance payment
received by the Company for claims made as described in the preceding
sentence, less the amount of any applicable insurance deductibles, will be
paid from the Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the
Sellers (to the bank account designated by the Sellers' Representative in
writing).

1.5.5 In addition to the foregoing, to the extent there are any customer
claims relating to discrepancies in the cash, coins, securities and other
assets of the Company's customers that are not included in the Estimated Vault
Inventory Shortfall or Estimated ATM Inventory Shortfall but that relate to
the period on or prior to Closing, (a) the Sellers' Representative and the
Purchaser 

shall jointly work with the Company's customers to resolve any such
discrepancies and, upon the request of the Sellers' Representative, the
Purchaser will submit the pertinent claims for losses to the insurer or
insurers under the Company's insurance policies covering such losses, and (b)
the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, agrees to promptly
reimburse the Purchaser for the full amount of any losses related to such
claims (net of insurance proceeds less applicable deductions).

1.6 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Purchaser, the Company, each Seller and any of their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable in connection
with this Agreement such amounts as each such party is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
applicable Law. Any such amounts that are so deducted and withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Body on a timely basis shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. The Purchaser shall
provide the Sellers' Representative written notice of any intent to withhold
at least 3 Business Days prior to withholding any such amount and shall, upon
request, work with the Sellers' Representative in good faith to minimize any
required withholding; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, this sentence
shall not apply to any payments to employees pursuant to Section 6.11.6
hereof.

1.7 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser's payment of the Purchase
Price and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
shall not include the Purchaser's acquisition of ownership of the Excluded
Assets, which such Excluded Assets shall be transferred by the Company to the
Sellers' Representative at or prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE II 

CLOSING AND TERMINATION

Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (or the waiver thereof by the party entitled to waive

satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the closing of the sale and
purchase of the Shares provided for in Section 1.1 (the "Closing") shall take

under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Law) or Section 7.1.6 shall
not have been satisfied or waived as of the End Date but all other conditions
set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived as of the End
Date (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied

2.2.3 by the Purchaser if there has been a violation or breach by the Company
or the Sellers of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement that has prevented or that would prevent the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Section 7.1 to complete the Closing, in either case
which has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days or such longer
period of time during which the Company and the Sellers are diligently
pursuing a cure (or by the End Date or any extension thereof, if sooner),
after receiving written notice thereof from the Purchaser; provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 2.2.3 if there has been a violation or breach by the Purchaser
which has prevented or would prevent satisfaction of any condition set forth
in Section 7.2; or

2.2.4 by the Sellers' Representative if there has been a violation or breach
by the Purchaser of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement that has prevented or that would prevent the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 to complete the Closing, in either case
which has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days or such longer
period of time during which the Purchaser is diligently pursuing a cure (or by
the End Date or any extension thereof, if sooner), after receiving written
notice thereof from the Sellers' Representative; provided, however, that the
Sellers' Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 2.2.4 if there has been a violation or breach by the
Company or the Sellers which has prevented or would prevent satisfaction of
any condition set forth in Section 7.1.

2.3 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, or both, pursuant to Section
2.2, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the purchase of the Shares
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by the Purchaser or the
Sellers' Representative. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein
each party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other materials of
any other party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the
same.

2.4 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, then each of the parties shall be relieved of their duties
and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such
termination and, except as set forth in Section 2.5, such termination shall be
without Liability to the Purchaser, the Company or any Seller; provided,
however, that the obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 2.4,
Section 6.1.3, Section 6.8, Article X and the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall in each case survive any such termination and
shall be enforceable hereunder, and provided, further, that nothing in this
Section 2.4 shall relieve the Company or the Sellers from liability for any
breach occurring prior to any such termination of any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or any party for Fraud.

2.5 Reverse Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
and without limiting the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated (including
following the Company or Sellers having sought relief pursuant to Section 10.4
and such relief not being granted) by (i) Sellers' Representative pursuant to
Section 2.2.4; or (ii) either the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative
pursuant to Section 2.2.1 (but only if all conditions to Closing in Section
7.1 (other than Section 7.1.4 (as it relates to any approval required under
the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Law) and Section 7.1.6) have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are
to be satisfied at the Closing, including delivery of the Closing deliverable
contemplated by Article VIII, but subject to such conditions then being
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date) ,
then the Purchaser shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts as designated by the Sellers'
Representative, a cash amount equal to $35,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination
Fee") within three (3) Business Days of the effective date of such
termination. The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this Section 2.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Purchaser nor
the Sellers and the Company would have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to timely pay the Reverse Termination Fee
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Purchaser for the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee, the Purchaser shall pay to the Company the reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of
enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts owed at three (3) percentage points over the prime lending rate
prevailing at such time, as published in The Wall Street Journal, from the
date such amounts were required to be paid hereunder until the date actually
received by the Company (the "Reverse Termination Fee Expenses").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if this Agreement
is terminated and such termination gives rise to the obligation of the
Purchaser to pay the Reverse Termination Fee, the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee and any Reverse Termination Fee Expenses by the Purchaser
shall constitute liquidated damages, not a penalty and shall be the Company's
and the Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy for any breach, loss or damage
arising out of this Agreement, and the Company and the Sellers shall have no
rights or claims against the Purchaser arising out of, or related to, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided, that, nothing in this Section 2.5
shall relieve Purchaser from Liability for Fraud.

3.16 Employee Benefits Plans.

3.16.1 Schedule 3.16.1 sets forth a true and complete list of each "employee
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), determined without regard to
whether such plan is subject to ERISA, and each pension, retirement, profit
sharing, savings, bonus, commission, deferred compensation, incentive, equity
or equity-based, paid time off, employment, severance, change of control,
separation, retention, health, welfare, life insurance, disability, vacation,
supplemental unemployment, fringe or any other material benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, contract, arrangement or agreement
(written or oral) that is maintained, sponsored or contributed or required to
be contributed to by the Company, or with respect to which the Company is a
party or has any Liability, for the benefit or remuneration, of any current or
former employees, directors, officers, consultants, or independent contractors
of the Company or the spouses, dependents or beneficiaries of any of them
(each, a "Company Benefit Plan").

3.16.2 With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to
the Purchaser true and complete copies of the plan documents and any
amendments thereto (or if the plan is not written, a written description
thereof), any related trust or other funding vehicle, annual reports required
to be filed within the last three years with any Governmental Body with
respect to such plan, actuarial reports, copies of material correspondence
with all Governmental Bodies within the past three years, plan summaries or
summary plan descriptions required under ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Laws ("Applicable Benefit Laws"), and the most recent determination
letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to
each such plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and such
other documentation with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan that has
been reasonably requested in writing by counsel to the Purchaser prior to the
date hereof.

3.16.3 No Company Benefit Plan is or was at any time subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor is or was at any time any Company
Benefit Plan (i) a "multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
(ii) subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
(iii) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063, 4064 or
4066 of ERISA or (iv) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA, and the Company does not have any Liability for any
such plan maintained, sponsored or contributed or required to be contributed
to by any Person (whether incorporated or unincorporated), that together with
the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), or to which such ERISA Affiliate has
any Liability.

3.16.4 Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, administered, invested
and maintained, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms and in
compliance, in all material respects, with all Applicable Benefit Laws
(including ERISA and the Code) and all written representations made by
officers and human resources personnel of the Company to the current and
former employees, directors, officers, consultants and independent contractors
of the Company and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries. Each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS, or with respect to a prototype or volume submitter plan, can rely on an
opinion or advisory letter from the IRS to the prototype or volume submitter
plan sponsor, to the effect that such plan is so qualified and that the plan
and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal Income Taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. To the knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to the
form or operation of such Company Benefit Plan that could cause the loss of
such qualification or tax-exempt status. The Company has not incurred, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no facts exist which reasonably could be
expected to result in, any Liability, tax fee or penalty to the Company with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan under any Applicable Benefit Law (other
than to pay premiums, contributions or benefits in the ordinary course
consistent with the terms of such plans). All benefits, contributions,
obligations and premiums relating to each Company Benefit Plan have been
timely paid in accordance with the terms of such Company Benefit Plan and all
Applicable Benefit Laws and accounting principles, and all benefits accrued
under any unfunded Company Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise
adequately reserved to the extent required by, and in accordance with, GAAP.
There are no outstanding defaults or violations by any party to any Company
Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred
or reasonably expects to incur, either directly or indirectly, any liability
under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any other party has been in
breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or
the trusts or other funding media relating thereto.

3.16.5 Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16.5, no Company Benefit Plan
provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) for current or former employees, directors, officers,
consultants, or independent contractors (or any of their dependents, spouses
or beneficiaries) of the Company for periods extending beyond their retirement
or other termination of service, other than continuation coverage mandated by
Applicable Benefit Laws and only to the extent required under such law for
which the applicable person pays the full premium therefor.

3.16.6 The Company has the right under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan
and under Applicable Benefit Law to amend, revise, merge or terminate such
plan (or its participation in such plan) at any time exclusively and
unilaterally by action of the Company, and no additional contributions or
funding would be required to properly effect such termination.

3.16.7 Other than as disclosed in Schedule 3.16.7, the execution, delivery and
performance of, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement, either alone or in combination with any related event, including
without limitation termination of employment or other service, will not (1)
entitle any current or former employee, director, officer, consultant, or
independent contractors (or any of their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries)
of the Company to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payments, (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due, any such individual, or (3) increase the amount of
or accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any amounts under any Company
Benefit Plan. The Company has not made any payments, is not obligated to make
any payments, nor is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances
could obligate the Company to make any payments that will not be deductible
for federal Income Tax purposes by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The
Company does not have any obligation to make any gross-up payments associated
with, or reimburse for, any taxes, interest or penalties incurred under
Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code.

3.16.8 There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or
anticipated claims, investigations, examinations, audits or other Legal
Proceedings or actions by, against, involving or on behalf of any Company
Benefit Plan, by any current or former employee, director, officer,
consultant, or independent contractors (or any of their dependents, spouses or
beneficiaries) of the Company under such Company Benefit Plan, by any
Governmental Bodies or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course consistent with
the terms of the Company Benefit Plan), and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there exists no events or circumstances or state of facts which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such claim, investigation, examination, audit or other Legal Proceeding or to
affect the qualification of any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code.

3.16.9 Each service provider of the Company who has been classified as an
"employee" or as an "independent contractor" has been properly classified as
such, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set
of circumstances that could subject the Company or any Company Benefit Plan to
any Liability, tax, penalty or fee under ERISA, the Code or any Applicable
Benefit Law relating to the failure to properly classify any service provider
of the Company as an "employee" or "independent contractor" for any purpose
whatsoever.

3.16.10 None of the Company or any employee, officer or agent thereof, nor any
trustee, administrator, fiduciary or other "party in interest" or
"disqualified person" has engaged in a nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
result in any Company Liability.

3.16.11 Each Company Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan or arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code is and has been in
written compliance, and has been operated and administered in compliance, with
Section 409A of the Code. The Company has no obligation to make any gross-up
payment associated with, or reimburse for, any taxes, interest or penalties
incurred under Section 409A of the Code.

3.16.12 To the extent any Company Benefit Plan is intended to be grandfathered
under the terms of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
("PPACA"), the Company has complied with the applicable provisions of PPACA,
the Code, ERISA and Applicable Benefit Laws in all material respects, and the
Company has not taken, or failed to take, any action which would cause such
Company Benefit Plan to lose such grandfathered status. Each Company Benefit
Plan that constitutes a "group health plan" has been operated and administered
in compliance with PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act") and the applicable
regulations and guidance thereunder in all material respects. The Company does
not owe any Taxes imposed by Code Section 4980H for any months or calendar
years ending prior to the Closing Date. The Company has not incurred, and, to
the knowledge of the Sellers, no condition exists with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company to any
Tax, fine, interest or penalty or other Liability imposed by the Affordable
Care Act.

3.16.13 Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "pension plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA but is not qualified under Code section 401(a) (each
a "Nonqualified Plan") is exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as
an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No
assets of the Company are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar
funding vehicle.

3.16.14 The Company has acquired and holds certain life insurance policies on
the lives of participants in certain of such Nonqualified Plans to fund the
Company's obligations under certain of such Nonqualified Plans, and the cash
surrender value of those life insurance policies as of the date hereof equals
or exceeds the Company's liability under the applicable Nonqualified Plan as
of the date hereof. Schedule 3.16.14 contains a true and complete list of the
liability of the Company under each such Nonqualified Plan as of the date
hereof and the identity and cash surrender value as of the date hereof of each
life insurance policy, if any, held by the Company to pay the Company's
obligations under such Nonqualified Plan.

3.16.15 Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers or executives
has made any commitment (written or oral, binding or otherwise) to adopt or
establish any new Company Benefit Plan or to modify or amend any Company
Benefit Plan.

3.17 Labor.

6.2.2.20 making material changes in any method of accounting or auditing
practice;

6.2.2.21 amending the Company Governing Documents; or

6.2.2.22 entering into any Contract to do any of the foregoing, or authorize

6.3 Consents. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts, and the
Purchaser shall cooperate with the Sellers, to obtain at the earliest
practicable date all consents and approvals required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4.2.

6.4 Filings with Governmental Bodies.

6.4.1 Each of the Purchaser, the Company (if necessary) and the Sellers shall
(a) make or cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of
their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates by the relevant Governmental
Bodies under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in
any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, (b)
comply as promptly as reasonably practical with any request under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other
materials received by each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries
from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Body in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing
(including, subject to reasonable and customary confidentiality
considerations, providing copies of such documents to each other prior to
filing and considering in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of any of the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or other
Governmental Body under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect
to any such filing or any such transaction. The Purchaser shall pay all
administrative filing fees required by such filings.

6.4.2 Subject to applicable Law, each of the Purchaser, the Sellers and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing or submission to be
made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) promptly inform each other of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications from, any
Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction, (c)
provide the other party in advance, with a reasonable opportunity for review
and comment thereon, copies of any material written communication to a
Governmental Body under any Antitrust Law relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (d) not participate in any material meeting
with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or
other inquiry without giving the Purchaser, on one hand, or the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and the Company), on the other hand,
prior notice of the meeting and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate and (e) consult and cooperate
with one another in good faith in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to Legal Proceedings
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. The Sellers and the Purchaser may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.4 as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, or to anyone else, unless express written permission (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (the Sellers, the Company or the Purchaser, as the
case may be).

6.4.3 Each of the Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign treaties, statutes, rules, regulations,
Orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of the Purchaser, the
Company and the Sellers shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist every such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned every decree, judgment, injunction or other Order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action. Each
of the Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required to obtain all clearances,
approvals, authorizations, consents, waivers, actions or non-actions required
under, and to cause the expiration of the notice or waiting periods under, the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly
as possible after the execution of this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company, the Sellers and the Purchaser
each agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment, including any
Order or Legal Proceeding instituted (or threatened), under or in connection
with any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local
and non-United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the
parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
expeditiously as possible; provided, that prior to taking any such steps or
other actions contemplated by this Section 6.4 that may affect the timing or
likelihood of approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Antitrust Laws, a party hereto shall consult with the other parties
and their respective Representatives and consider in good faith their
suggestions with respect to the taking of any such steps or other actions. For
the avoidance of doubt, "reasonable best efforts" under this Section 6.4.3
shall include the Purchaser's obligation, if necessary to resolve objections
raised by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law and to permit the Closing to occur
on or before the End Date, to agree to and subsequently implement (a) the
sale, divestiture, disposition, licensing, or holding separate of one or more
businesses, product or service lines, or assets of the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or the Company, or (b) limitations on the Purchaser's freedom of
action with respect to one or more businesses, product or service lines, or
assets of the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Company, in each case provided
that any such steps or other actions affecting the assets or businesses of the
Company shall be conditions upon the prior occurrence of the Closing and shall
not include Purchaser's "Brinks" trademark or trade name. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will Purchaser be
obligated pursuant to this Agreement to take any of the actions in (a) or (b)
of this Section 6.4.3 where such actions, individually or in the aggregate,
would involve businesses, product or service lines, or assets of the
Purchaser, or any combination thereof, and would result in the loss of
revenues (as measured by revenues for the twelve-month period commencing on
May 1, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2018) in excess of $30,000,000.

6.5 Other Actions. Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (a) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their
respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

6.6 Non Negotiation; Non-Solicitation.

6.6.1 The Sellers will not, and will not cause or permit the Company or any of
the Representatives of the Company or the Sellers to, directly or indirectly,
(a) facilitate, encourage, solicit, initiate or engage or otherwise
participate in any discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or
offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (b) furnish or cause to be
furnished, to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations,
properties or assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition
Transaction, (c) negotiate, engage in or otherwise consummate an Acquisition
Transaction or (d) facilitate, or assist in any manner or participate in any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (x) any
transaction or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company, (y) any
proposal for the issuance of ten percent (10%) or more of the equity
securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or securities of
another person or (z) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, ten percent (10%) or more of the equity securities of the
Company or assets that represent ten percent (10%) or more of the total
consolidated assets of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers have ceased and caused to be
terminated, and have caused the Company and each of its Representatives or
other Persons acting on any of their behalf to cease and terminate, any
existing discussions with any Person (other than the Purchaser) that relate to
any Acquisition Transaction. In the event that any Seller or the Company
receives an inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Sellers
will provide the Purchaser with prompt notice thereof, which notice shall
include the material terms of, and the identity of the Person or Persons
making such inquiry, proposal or offer.

6.6.2 Until the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall consummate or enter into a definitive agreement for any
merger, equity exchange, acquisition, purchase or sale of equity or assets, or
other business combination or change of control transaction with any Person
that involves a business or assets in the United States (an "Interim
Transaction"), that the Purchaser reasonably believes and determines, in good
faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel, would be reasonably
expected to increase either (i) the risk of delaying (that is, by thirty (30)
calendar days or more), the expiration or termination of the statutory waiting
period applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act,
or (ii) the risk of preventing or delaying the Closing due to an objection,
challenge, or Legal Proceeding under any Antitrust Law. The Purchaser shall
provide prompt written notice to the Sellers' Representative of the
Purchaser's execution of a definitive agreement regarding an Interim
Transaction, and the Purchaser's determination; provided, however, that if the
Purchaser is restricted by obligations of confidentiality with respect to
disclosure of such Interim Transaction, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to disclose to the Sellers' Representative such Interim
Transaction as soon as possible.

6.7 Resignation of Directors and Officers; Indemnification, Exculpation and
Insurance.

6.7.1 On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide evidence of
the resignation of all the directors and officers of the Company, including
any Sellers holding such positions, effective as of the Closing.

6.7.2 At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase (at its sole
expense) an extended reporting period endorsement to the Company's currently
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance (the "Tail Policy") with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing ("Pre-
Closing Claims") and covering a period of six (6) years from and after the
Closing Date, which endorsement the Purchaser agrees to maintain in full force
and effect for its full term. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable to the officers and directors of
the Company on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Indemnitees")
as those provisions contained in the Company Governing Documents, and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years following the Closing in any manner that would have the
effect of impairing the coverage available under the Tail Policy with respect
to Pre-Closing Claims or otherwise adversely impact the Indemnitees (unless
such modification is required by applicable Law).

6.7.3 The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and his or her heirs and
Representatives.

6.7.4 In the event that the Company or any of its successors or assigns (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (b)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, the Purchaser shall cause proper
provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.7.5 The obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 6.7 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 6.7 applies (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.7).

6.7.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.7,
no Indemnitee shall have any right (and each such Person hereby irrevocably
waives any claim with respect to) to advancement, indemnification,
contribution or other recovery of any kind (in any capacity whatsoever,
including under any officers' and directors' liability insurance policy) from
the Purchaser, the Company or any other Person with respect to any matter for
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party would be or may be entitled
indemnification from under Article IX (in each case, without giving effect to
any limitations including as to time, survival periods, deductibles,
thresholds, caps, and knowledge or materiality qualifiers), including the
costs and expenses of defending any claims with respect to any such matter.

6.8 Publicity. None of the parties hereto shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior mutual written consent of each of the
parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law, in which case such
party shall consult with the other parties regarding the contents of such
disclosure before issuing such press release or public announcement. The
parties hereto shall cooperate to jointly develop all communications to the
public and the employees of the Company. Attached hereto as Exhibit G is the
joint press release approved by the parties hereto with respect to the
announcement of the entry by the parties into this Agreement.

6.9 Use of Name. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Company to, assign and transfer all rights in and to the name "Dunbar,"
such name constituting Owned Intellectual Property, to Dunbar Security
Products, Inc., and shall provide to the Purchaser evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser of such assignment and transfer. On or prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause Dunbar Security Products, Inc. to enter
into that certain Intellectual Property License Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the "Intellectual Property License Agreement") together with the
Company and the Purchaser.

6.10 Supplemental Disclosure. From time to time prior to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the Company and the Purchaser,
respectively, shall promptly notify the other of any matter coming to such
Person's attention prior to the Closing which would result in the failure to
satisfy any of the conditions specified in Article VII; provided, however,
that, the delivery of any such notice shall not (a) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any provisions of this Agreement or (b) limit the
remedies available to the parties hereunder after receiving any such notice.

6.11 Continuing Employee Benefits.

6.11.1 As of the Closing, and for twelve (12) months following the Closing or,
if earlier, until termination of their employment, the Purchaser shall
provide, or shall cause the Company to provide, the Continuing Employees with
substantially similar in the aggregate base salaries or base wage rates, as
applicable, and annual bonus opportunities as provided by the Company to the
Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing. As of the
Closing, and for twelve (12) months following the Closing or, if earlier,
until termination of their employment, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall
cause the Company to provide, the Continuing Employees with substantially
similar in the aggregate employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pension, equity or equity-based incentives, deferred compensation and post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits) either (i) as provided by the Company
to Continuing Employees as of immediately before the Closing or (ii) as
provided by the Purchaser to its similarly-situated employees. For purposes of
determining after the Closing the extent to which any Continuing Employee is
eligible for or vested in (and, in regard to any severance or vacation
entitlement only, the level of benefits under) any of the Purchaser plans
covering such Continuing Employee, the Purchaser shall credit such Continuing
Employee for all service with the Company (and its predecessors) before the
Closing to the same extent such service was credited for the same purposes by
the Company as of the Closing under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan,
except to the extent that such service credit would result in the duplication
of benefits or compensation for the same period of services.

6.11.2 The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, use commercially
reasonable efforts for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to
(a) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting
period provision, pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work
requirement or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the Purchaser employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement providing health or welfare benefits covering such Continuing
Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively at work requirement or other restriction was not applicable to such
Continuing Employee under the terms of the analogous Company Benefit Plans in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (b) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements under any Purchaser employee benefit
plan, program, or arrangement with respect to such Continuing Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing Employee under the analogous Company Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

6.11.3 The Company shall not be required to take any actions prior to the
Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or liquidate the Dunbar Armored Non-
Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Purchaser reserves the complete
authority to amend, freeze, terminate and/or liquidate the Deferred
Compensation Plan after the Closing Date as the Purchaser in its sole
discretion may determine, subject to the terms of the Deferred Compensation
Plan and applicable law. If and to the extent the Purchaser terminates and
liquidates the Deferred Compensation Plan after the Closing Date pursuant to
Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), the Purchaser agrees that
(i) the participants' accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan will not
be distributed as the result of such termination and liquidation until after
the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, and (ii) each
participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan will be permitted to participate
in a comparable deferred compensation plan of the Purchaser in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such plan, provided that such participant is then
employed by the Purchaser and is a member of a "select group of management or
highly compensated employees" of the Purchaser within the meaning of ERISA (it
being understood that each participant as of the date hereof is a member of a
"select group of management or highly compensated employees"). Effective no
later than the day before the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate its
401(k) plan by proper board of directors action and cease deferrals with
respect to any compensation that is earned after the day before the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall allow the Continuing Employees to enter its or an
Affiliate's 401(k) plan as soon as administratively practicable after the
Closing Date, and to rollover their account balances and outstanding loans to
such Purchaser or Affiliate 401(k) plan to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

6.11.4 If and to the extent requested by the Purchaser (which request shall be
made at least five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date), the Company
shall take any and all actions required (including the adoption of resolutions
by the Company Board of Directors) to the extent permitted by Law to amend,
freeze, terminate and/or liquidate any Company Benefit Plan immediately before
the Closing Date and to implement any such related actions as the Purchaser
may reasonably request (except as to the Deferred Compensation Plan and 401(k)
plan which will be subject to the provisions of Section 6.11.3 above).

6.11.5 Purchaser shall pay the final premium payment due for all employees
covered by long term care insurance protection in an amount not to exceed
$205,000, if such premium comes due after the Closing Date.

6.11.6 Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers agree to pay bonuses to Company
employees in accordance with the terms of Schedule 6.11.6 hereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser, the Company
and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that all Transaction Payments are being
made in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and any deduction resulting therefrom shall
be attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the account of the
Sellers.

6.11.7 Prior to Closing, the Company shall transfer the Company Benefit Plans
set forth on Schedule 6.11.7 to Dunbar Security Products, Inc.

6.11.8 Nothing in this Section 6.11, express or implied: (a) shall confer upon
any employee, officer, director, or service provider of the Company any right
to continue in the employ or service of the Purchaser, the Company, or any of
their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates or any right to any particular
term or condition of employment or service, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof
(including following the Closing, the Company) to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director, or service provider at any time
for any or no reason whatsoever, or (b) confer upon any Person not a party to
this Agreement, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
including any third-party beneficiary rights, under or by reason of this
Section 6.11. Nothing in this Section 6.11 shall be deemed to (x) establish,
amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation
plan, program, policy, Contract, arrangement or agreement, or (y) alter or
limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
following the Closing, the Company) to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, Contract, arrangement or agreement.

6.12 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Any Tax Return to be prepared
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.12 shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with this Agreement, consistent with applicable Laws, and
consistent with Tax positions taken by the Company prior to the Closing Date
with respect to similar Tax Returns, to the extent consistent with applicable
Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the parties:

6.12.1 The Sellers' Representative, at the expense of the Sellers, shall (i)
cause the Company to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company
that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date and (ii) prepare
all Income Tax Returns relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (each such period a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") without regard to
the time when such returns are required to be filed (collectively, "Seller
Prepared Returns").

6.12.2 The Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare and timely file all
other Tax Returns for the Company for taxable periods that include the Closing
Date ("Purchaser Prepared Returns").

6.12.3 The Sellers' Representative (with respect to each Seller Prepared
Return) and Purchaser (with respect to each Purchaser Prepared Return) shall
deliver to the other party a copy of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days
before the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed (including
applicable extensions), or as soon as reasonably possible if such Tax Return
is required to be filed within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing
Date. The Sellers' Representative (with respect to each Purchaser Prepared
Return delivered to it) and Purchaser (with respect to each Seller Prepared
Return delivered to it) shall review each such Tax Return within ten (10) days
after the delivery of such Tax Return. Each of the Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved any Tax Return prepared by the
other party pursuant to this Section 6.12.3 and timely delivered if it does
not submit issues or comments within such ten (10) day review period. If the
Sellers' Representative (with respect to a Purchaser Prepared Return) or
Purchaser (with respect to a Seller Prepared Return) disputes any items shown
on such Tax Return, it shall deliver to the other party a written description
of such items within such ten (10) day period. The Parties shall negotiate in
good faith and work to resolve any timely-raised issues, comments, or concerns
arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return.

6.12.4 In the event the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser are unable to
resolve any dispute with respect to such timely-raised issue within twenty
(20) business days following the delivery of a Tax Return, the Parties will
engage the Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and the Accounting Referee's determination shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The Accounting Referee shall resolve the
dispute within twenty (20) days after the item has been referred to it. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by each party in
the percentage inversely proportionate to the percentage of the total items
submitted for dispute that are resolved in such party's favor.

6.12.5 In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date, the amount of any Taxes for the Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as follows: the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall
(a) in the case of any Taxes, other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, sales, payroll, receipts, expenditures or franchise Taxes, or ad
valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period prior to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Taxable period, and
(b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, sales, payroll,
receipts, expenditures or franchise Taxes, or ad valorem Taxes, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period
ended as of the end of the Closing Date.

6.12.6 The Purchaser shall, upon the request and at the expense of the
Sellers' Representative, cause the Company or any relevant Affiliate of the
Company to reasonably cooperate with the Sellers' Representative in obtaining
any Income Tax refund or credit to which the Sellers may be entitled in their
respective individual capacities that arose in a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (an "Applicable Refund"). For the avoidance of doubt,
(i) an Applicable Refund shall include any refund or credit arising under a
composite or other similar return filed by the Company or any relevant
Affiliate of the Company and joined by one or more Sellers and (ii) this
Section 6.12.6 shall impose no obligation upon the Purchaser with respect to
any Tax refund or credit to which the Company or any relevant Affiliate of the
Company may be entitled in their respective capacities as business entities.

6.13 No Amended Returns or Elections. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company
or any of its Affiliates to, (a) amend any Tax Returns of the Company filed
with respect to any Tax year ending on or before the Closing Date or (b) other
than a 338(h)(10) Election, make a Tax election that has retroactive effect to
any Tax year ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

6.14 Tax Cooperation. The Sellers, the Sellers' Representative, the Company
and the Purchaser shall each cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party or parties, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other Legal Proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation, or other Legal Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Furthermore, each party hereto
covenants and agrees that it shall give all other parties prompt written
notice of any correspondence received from the IRS or any other Tax Authority
regarding any potential examination, audit or any other action pertaining to
the transactions contemplated herein. The Sellers, the Sellers'
Representative, the Company and the Purchaser each agree to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority.

6.15 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration
documentary, recording or other similar Taxes, if any, resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne
by the Purchaser. The Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser shall
prepare and file any and all required Tax Returns for or with respect to such
Transfer Taxes with any and all appropriate Tax Authorities.

6.16 338(h)(10) Election.

6.16.1 At the written election of the Purchaser (which election shall be made
not later than ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital Statement and the related final Purchase Price, in accordance
with Section 1.4.8 and Section 1.4.9, respectively), the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall join in the timely making (or causing to be timely made) of a
338(h)(10) Election with respect to the sale of the Shares. The Purchaser and
the Sellers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
forms or documents as are required by applicable Law for an effective
338(h)(10) Election, including, but not limited to IRS Form 8023, which forms
and documents shall be prepared substantially in compliance with the
Allocation Schedule (as defined below) and in accordance with the rules set
forth therein (the "338(h)(10) Election Forms"). At the Closing, the Sellers
will provide to the Purchaser two (2) originally executed IRS Forms 8023
(together with any schedules or attachments thereto) consenting to the making
of the 338(h)(10) Election. In the event the Purchaser determines not to make
a 338(h)(10) Election, such IRS Forms 8023 received at the Closing shall be
destroyed. The Sellers and the Sellers' Representative shall at all times
cooperate with the Purchaser in the making of the 338(h)(10) Election and
executing the 338(h)(10) Election Forms.

6.16.2 The Sellers, the Company and the Purchaser shall file all Tax Returns
in a manner consistent with the 338(h)(10) Election and will not take any
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Laws. The
Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax items
resulting from the 338(h)(10) Election on their Tax Returns to the extent
required by applicable Law.

6.16.3 Seller's only obligations with respect to the 338(h)(10) Election are
set forth in this Section 6.16 and Section 6.17. The Sellers make no
representation, warranty, guaranty or other undertaking whatsoever as to the
amount, if any, available to the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to a 338(h)(10) Election. For the sake of
clarity, (A) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Sellers shall have no liability to the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates for any Losses arising in taxable periods ending after
the Closing Date that are attributable to a determination that (i) the
338(h)(10) Election is ineffective or invalid, or (ii) the Purchase Price and
liabilities of the Company should be allocated or apportioned in a manner that
differs from that provided for under Section 6.17 and the Allocation Schedule,
and (B) provided, however, clause (A) of this Section 6.16.3 (x) shall not
apply with respect to, and shall not limit indemnification for, Losses arising
from a breach of any covenant provided in this Agreement by any Seller and (y)
shall not apply with respect to, and shall not limit indemnification for,
Losses for which indemnification is claimed pursuant to Section 9.4.1.1;
provided, however, with respect to this clause (y) the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement.

6.17 Purchase Price Allocation. In connection with a 338(h)(10) Election,
Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of
the Company (plus other relevant items for Income Tax purposes) shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting purposes) in accordance with the methodology provided on
the allocation schedule attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Allocation
Schedule"). The Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
Allocation Schedule has been prepared in accordance with Code Sections 338 and
1060, as applicable, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Each
of the Company, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall file all relevant Tax
Returns in a manner that reflects an allocation of the Purchase Price and
other items of consideration under the Code and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. The
Company, the Sellers and the Purchaser agree (i) to prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns, including, but not limited to IRS Form 8883, (and all
supplements thereto) in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule and
(ii) in the course of any examination, audit or other Legal Proceeding with
respect to any Tax Return or Tax, will take no position, and cause its
Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule for
Tax purposes, unless required by applicable Law. The parties will revise the
Allocation Schedule in accordance with the principles and methodologies set
forth in the Allocation Schedule to the extent necessary to reflect any post-
Closing payment or adjustment made pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement. The parties will not otherwise revise the Allocation Schedule for
Tax purposes, unless required by applicable Law. If the Sellers'
Representative or the Purchaser becomes aware that the IRS proposes to adjust
the allocation of the Purchase Price in a manner inconsistent with the
Allocation Schedule, it shall reasonably notify the other party promptly in
writing. In accordance with Section 6.14, the Sellers' Representative and the
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with one another with a view to
sustaining the allocation of the Purchase Price in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Schedule; provided, further, in the event of a proposed IRS
adjustment to the Allocation Schedule during an audit of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, at the written request of the Sellers' Representative, the
Sellers' Representative shall provide the Purchaser with additional supporting
information for the Allocation Schedule (e.g., a third-party valuation report
or appraisal) and the Purchaser shall utilize such additional information and
reasonably defend the Allocation Schedule or specific items therein.

6.18 RandW Insurance Policy. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid, all outstanding costs and expenses related to the RandW
Insurance Policy, including the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage
commissions, and other fees and expenses of such policy. The Purchaser shall
take all steps as may be reasonably required to cause the RandW Insurance Policy
to be issued on a basis consistent with the binder and policy attached hereto
as Exhibit D. The Purchaser shall not amend the RandW Insurance Policy without
the written consent of the Sellers' Representative. The provisions of this
Section 6.18 are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
Seller and such Seller's estates, heirs and representatives.

6.19 Closing Conditions. Each party hereto shall, and the Sellers shall cause
the Company to, use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article
VII hereof.

6.20 Release of Company Released Parties and Purchaser Released Parties. Upon
Closing, the Seller Releasing Parties release and discharge, and covenant not
to sue, the Company Released Parties and Purchaser Released Parties from any
and all claims, actions, causes of actions, sums of money due, attorneys'
fees, suits, debts, covenants, contracts, agreements, promises, demands or
liabilities whatsoever, including representative, derivative and class claims,
in law or in equity, whether known or unknown, which the Seller Releasing
Parties ever had, now has, or might in the future have against the Company
Released Parties and Purchaser Released Parties; provided, however, that this
Section 6.20 shall not be deemed to release or impair (i) any rights or claims
of any party under the terms of this Agreement or any ancillary agreement
entered into in connection with this Agreement, or (ii) any right or claims
that may arise as a result of an action or event occurring after the Closing
(the "Retained Claims"). Other than the Retained Claims, Seller Releasing
Parties represent and warrant that they have no actual knowledge of any claims
against the Company Released Parties or the Purchaser Released Parties that
have not been discharged by the releases and covenants not to sue provided
herein. In any action asserting that claims are barred by the release and
covenant not to sue of this Section 6.20, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements in
addition to costs of suit.

6.21 Use of Marks. Each Seller agrees that during the Term (as defined in the
Intellectual Property License Agreement) and for a period of ten (10) years
after termination of the Intellectual Property License Agreement for any
reason, such Seller will not use the Dunbar Marks (as defined in the
Intellectual Property License Agreement), or license such Dunbar Marks to
third parties or allow any infringing uses, for services or products
competitive with the Brinks Services (as defined in the Intellectual Property
License Agreement).

9.1 Exclusive Remedy. Other than in the case of (a) Claims based on Fraud or
(b) matters subject to the resolution process set forth in Section 1.4 or
Section 1.5 hereof, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions
in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any
breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other matter
contained in this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall prevent a
party from seeking or obtaining an injunction or other equitable remedy,
including in accordance with Section 10.4 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, no limitations (including the limitation set
forth in this Article IX), qualifications or procedures in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or modify the ability of Purchaser to make claims
under or recover under the RandW Insurance Policy; it being understood that any
matter for which there is coverage available under the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations, if any, set forth
in the RandW Insurance Policy.

9.2 Sources of Recovery. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, other than in the case of Fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy
of each Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of any Claim arising under
Sections 9.4.1.1, 9.4.1.4 and 9.4.2.1 shall be a claim for recovery pursuant
to the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, and the Purchaser hereby waives on
behalf of itself and each Purchaser Indemnified Party any and all rights and
remedies against the Sellers under this Article IX; provided, however:

9.2.1 with respect to any Losses resulting or arising from a breach of Section
3.9 (Taxes) such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to bring a
Claim under the provisions of Section 9.4.1.1 and seek to recover directly
from the Sellers in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Indemnity Cap less
the amount of such Losses recovered pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy or
any other applicable insurance policy or source of recovery in accordance with
Section 9.5.6 hereof, but if and only to the extent that (i) recovery under
the RandW Insurance Policy is not available following a claim being made under
the RandW Insurance Policy or exhaustion of the policy limits under the RandW
Insurance Policy, (ii) such Claim does not relate to any Loss arising in a
taxable period ending after the Closing Date solely attributable to any
invalidity or ineffectiveness of the 338(h)(10) Election, and (iii) such Claim
is brought within the applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.10;

9.2.2 with respect to any Losses resulting or arising from a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to bring a Claim under the provisions of Sections 9.4.1.1 and/or 9.4.2.1 and
seek to recover directly from the Sellers in an aggregate amount not to exceed
the Purchase Price less the amount of such Losses recovered pursuant to the
RandW Insurance Policy or any other applicable insurance policy or source of
recovery in accordance with Section 9.5.6 hereof, but if and only to the
extent that recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy is not available following
a claim being made under the RandW Insurance Policy or exhaustion of the policy
limits under the RandW Insurance Policy;

9.2.3 with respect to any Losses resulting or arising from any Claim arising
under Sections 9.4.1.1 or 9.4.2.1 (other than any Losses, directly or
indirectly, arising from, based upon, attributable to, in connection with or
related to any Excluded Matter for which there shall be no recovery by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Seller and for which the Purchaser
hereby waives on behalf of itself and each Purchaser Indemnified Party any and
all rights and remedies against the Sellers hereunder), such Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to bring a Claim under the provisions of
Sections 9.4.1.1 or 9.4.2.1 and to seek recovery directly from the Sellers in
an aggregate amount not to exceed the Indemnity Cap (other than claims arising
out of a breach of any Fundamental Representation for which the aggregate
amount will not exceed the Purchase Price), but if and only to the extent (a)
such Claim arises out of an Interim Breach, and (b) (i) recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy is not available following a claim being made under the RandW
Insurance Policy or exhaustion of the policy limits under the RandW Insurance
Policy, and (ii) such Claim is brought within the applicable survival period
set forth in Section 9.10; and

9.2.4 further provided, however, the Sellers shall have no Liability under
Section 9.4.1.1 or 9.4.2.1 (other than those arising out of a breach of the
Fundamental Representations) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification from
the Sellers exceeds $2,598,750, (the "Basket") and, in such event, (i) the
Sellers shall be liable only for the amount of such Losses in excess of the
Basket up to the amounts set forth in Sections 9.2.1, 9.2.2 and 9.2.3, and
(ii) the Sellers' Representative will reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for any amount of the Deductible, as applicable, in excess of the
Basket (other than with respect to Claims under the RandW Insurance Policy
relating to breaches of the Fundamental Representations, which the Sellers'
Representative will reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for one
hundred percent (100%) of the Deductible).

9.3 Limitation of Losses. In no event shall the Sellers be liable for any
Losses resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty under Sections
9.4.1.1 or 9.4.2.1 if any Deal Team Members (as defined the RandW Insurance
Policy) had Actual Knowledge (as defined in the RandW Policy) of the breach
prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate Liability of the Sellers for any and
all Losses under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price less the amount of such Losses recovered pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy or any other applicable insurance policy or source of
recovery in accordance with Section 9.5.6 hereof.

to indemnify and hold the Purchaser, the Company, and their respective

(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against:

9.4.1.1 any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, claims of any
kind, costs, interest, Taxes, fees and Expenses (collectively, "Losses")
arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting from a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
Article III, or any representation or warranty contained in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement;

9.4.1.2 any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the breach of any covenant by, or on the behalf of, the Company
under this Agreement;

recovered pursuant to an applicable Company insurance policy.

the Closing, each Seller hereby agrees, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from and
against:

9.4.2.1 any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
such Seller set forth in Article IV, or any representation or warranty
contained in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of such Seller pursuant
to this Agreement; and

9.4.2.2 any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the breach of any covenant by, or on the behalf of, the Sellers
under this Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Closing.

from and after the Closing, the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against:

9.4.3.1 any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to, or
resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser set forth in Article V, or any representation or warranty contained
in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement;

9.4.3.2 any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to, or
resulting from the breach of any covenant or other agreement by, or on behalf
of, the Purchaser under this Agreement.

9.5 Indemnification Procedures.

9.5.1 In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person or Losses suffered by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party or by a Seller Indemnified Party (any of the
forgoing, a "Claim"), in respect of which payment may be sought under Section
9.4 (regardless of the Basket referred to above), the indemnified party shall
reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of
which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to
the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party disputes its Liability with
respect to such Claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in
an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction as provided in Section 10.6.
The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense,
to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the indemnifying party
will not be entitled to assume the defense, negotiation, settlement or
otherwise deal with any Claim if (a) the Claim primarily relates to any
criminal act or Taxes, (b) the Claim seeks an injunction or equity relief
against the indemnified party or the Company as the primary element of such
Claim, or (c) upon petition by the indemnified party, an applicable court
rules that the indemnifying party failed or is failing to vigorously defend or
prosecute such Claim; provided, further, that the indemnifying party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party unless
the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages
and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
indemnified party or the Company or require any indemnified party or the
Company to admit fault, in which case no consent will be required. If the
indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder,
it shall within ten (10) Business Days (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim
so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the
indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein
provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for
such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim. If the indemnified party
defends any Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified
party for the Expenses of defending such Claim upon submission of periodic
bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense
of such Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party if (a) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (b) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Claim. The parties hereto agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Claim.

9.5.2 After any final deductible judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction
and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement
shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a
Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter.

9.5.3 The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of
any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying
party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the
indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss or prejudice as a result of
such failure.

9.5.4 For the purposes of calculating Losses pursuant to this Article IX, the
amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided shall not be
duplicative of any matter addressed in the Final Net Working Capital
Statement.

9.5.5 In the event that any Claim asserted hereunder is, or may be, the
subject of the RandW Insurance Policy, the Purchaser agrees to promptly notify
the applicable insurance carrier of any such Claim or Loss. The Purchaser
further agrees to pursue such Claims diligently and to reasonably cooperate
with the insurance carrier under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to such
Claims. Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable and good faith efforts
to seek recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy.

9.5.6 The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated net of any insurance proceeds of any kind (including the RandW
Insurance Policy) or other recoveries (net of direct collection expenses and
premium increases) actually received by Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the
Company on account of such Loss (including amounts receivable from any third
party for indemnification or contribution); provided, however, that Purchaser
shall have no obligation to make any claims against any insurance policies
(other than the RandW Insurance Policy) or third party indemnification or
contribution agreements with respect to any such Losses. In the event that an
insurance recovery is made by Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the Company
with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of
all direct collection expenses and premium increases) shall be remitted
promptly to Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers.

9.6 RandW Insurance Policy Deductible. The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that the RandW Insurance Policy contains a deductible or retention
equal to $5,197,500 (the "Deductible").

9.7 Materiality. For purposes of this Article IX other than with respect to
Interim Breaches (including the determination of whether there has been any
breach or inaccuracy in the representation or warranty and the determination
of the amount of any Loss that is subject to indemnification), each
representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard to,
and without giving effect to, the term "material" or "Material Adverse Effect"
or "in all material respects" or other similar qualification contained in, or
otherwise applicable to, such representation or warranty.

9.8 WAIVER. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS

in any other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on its face. Any
capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined
therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

10.2.1.4 Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

10.2.1.5 Headings. The provision of a table of contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

10.2.1.6 Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

10.2.1.7 Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

similar phrases as used in this Agreement shall mean that the subject
documents were posted to the virtual data room hosted by Bengur Bryan and Co.,

10.2.2 The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of

drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall

provision of this Agreement.

10.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or agreed upon
by the parties, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall each bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, it being understood that the Company may bear pre-Closing costs and
expenses of the Sellers and any such amounts shall be paid in full by the
Company pre-Closing (with any Transaction Expenses to be paid at Closing out
of the Initial Purchase Price).

10.4 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law (and for
which monetary damages would be insufficient to fully compensate the parties
hereto) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed (including any failure to take such actions as are required of any
party in this Agreement in order to proceed with Closing or to allow it to
occur) in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions (including a preliminary
injunction) to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which a party is entitled at law
or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the State
of Maryland, or in the event that such Federal courts lack subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court located in the State of Maryland in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any
Federal court located in the State of Maryland, or in the event that such
Federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located in
the State of Maryland. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
rights available under this Section 10.4 are an integral part of this
Agreement and without such rights, none of the parties hereto would have
entered into this Agreement. If any party to this Agreement seeks an
injunction or other Order to (i) prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and/or (ii) require specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, such party will not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such injunction or interim relief in
excess of USD $1,000.00, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or other security in excess of that amount. Nothing set forth in this
Section 10.4 shall require any party to this Agreement to institute any Legal
Proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or any other equitable
remedy under this Section 10.4 prior or as a condition to exercising any other
right or remedy under this Agreement or applicable Law.

10.5 Further Assurances. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agrees to execute
and deliver such other documents or agreements and to take such other action
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for the implementation of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.6 Submission to Jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the any Federal court located in the State of
Maryland, or in the event that such Federal courts lack subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court located in the State of Maryland over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action Legal Proceeding
related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

10.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) represents the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
or thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
or thereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement except when in conflict
with the terms of this Agreement). This Agreement may be amended, supplemented
or changed, and any provision hereof may be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the Company, the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such
breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the
part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland.

headings of this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are to be given

10.11 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as to reasonably effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

10.12 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as expressly provided in Section 6.7. No assignment
of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by
either the Sellers or the Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted
assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided, however,
that the Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or
obligations hereunder (including, without limitation, the Purchaser's rights
to purchase the Shares and the Purchaser's rights to seek indemnification
hereunder) to any Affiliate of the Purchaser and lender for collateral
purposes. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement
to the Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context
otherwise requires.

10.13 Sellers' Representative. Kevin R. Dunbar, or such other person as shall
succeed him pursuant to this Section 10.13, is hereby irrevocably designated
and appointed as the representative to act for and represent the Sellers with
respect to all matters arising out of Article IX and in those other matters
with respect to which this Agreement specifies that the Sellers'
Representative shall so act, as well as matters which require notice to be
given to the Sellers under this Agreement (including the full power and
authority on such Sellers' behalf to (a) execute this Agreement and otherwise
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) calculate the price
per Share for each Seller and any other amounts payable to each Seller
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) endorse and deliver any certificates or
instruments of assignment as the Purchaser shall reasonably request or which
the Sellers' Representative shall consider necessary or proper to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all of which shall have the
effect of binding the Sellers as if such Seller had personally executed such
agreement or instrument, (d) resolve any adjustments or issues relating to any
component of the Purchase Price, (e) execute and deliver on behalf of such
Seller any amendment or waiver hereto or to any other agreement contemplated
hereunder, (f) dispute, compromise, settle and pay any claims made in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including pursuant to Section 1.4.9, Section 1.5.2 and Section 1.5.4, (g) make
any calculations required under this Agreement (including calculations with
respect to the distribution of the Purchase Price or each Seller's pro rata
portion of the Purchase Price of any indemnification obligation) and (h) do
each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Seller or the
Sellers are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement).
This power is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and shall not be
affected by the death, incapacity, illness, dissolution or other inability to
act of such Seller. In the event of the death or incapacity of Kevin R.
Dunbar, upon notice thereof to the Purchaser, such other Person as may be
designated by a majority of the Sellers shall succeed Kevin R. Dunbar as the
Sellers' Representative. The power and authority of the Sellers'
Representative, as described in this Agreement, shall continue in force until
all rights and obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement shall have
terminated, expired or been fully performed. Each Seller shall indemnify the
Sellers' Representative against any damages (except such damages as result
from the Sellers' Representative' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that
the Sellers' Representative may suffer or incur in connection with any action
or omission of the Sellers' Representative. The Purchaser will be entitled to
rely upon, without investigation, any act, notice, calculation, instruction or
communication from the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers and
will not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken
in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or communications or writings
given or executed by the Sellers' Representative. Any time the Purchaser is
required to give notice to the parties hereunder, it may give such notice only
to the Sellers' Representatives on behalf of all Sellers and such notice to
the Sellers' Representatives shall be deemed given to all Sellers. All
decisions and actions by the Sellers' Representative shall be final and
binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

10.14 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Law or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by electronic transmission), each of which will be deemed to be an
original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be
deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of a signed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by .PDF file (portable
document format file) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement. Minor variations in the form of the signature
page, including footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such
other document, will be disregarded in determining a party's intent or the
effectiveness of such signature.

10.16 Waiver of Conflicts. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, stockholders, partners,
officers, employees, and Affiliates that DLA Piper LLP (US) (the "Firm")
represents the Company, the Sellers and the Sellers' Representative as a group
in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and all
ancillary agreements and the transaction contemplated herein (the
"Transaction"). The Firm has not represented, and does not represent, any
individual Seller in connection with the Transaction. It is understood by
Sellers that the Firm does represent certain Sellers in connection with estate
planning and related matters and expects to do so in the future. After the
Closing Date, it is expected that the Firm will represent the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group") in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein. The Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that the Firm
(or any successor) may represent the Seller Group in the future in connection
with issues that may arise under this Agreement. The Firm (or any successor)
may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller Group or any
Representative or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein. Each of the parties hereto consents
thereto, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such
party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been
carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or have
been advised they should do so in this connection. Communications between the
Company and the Firm prior to Closing made solely with respect to this
Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby will become the property of the Sellers' Representative
and the Sellers following Closing Date and will not be disclosed to the
Purchaser without the consent of the Sellers' Representative.

10.17 Attorney-Client Privilege. The Purchaser and the Company agree that
neither the Company nor the Purchaser shall have the right to assert the
attorney-client privilege as to pre-Closing and post-Closing communications
between the Sellers or the Company (for the Company, only with respect to pre-
Closing Date communications), on the one hand, and the Firm, on the other
hand, to the extent that the privileged communications relate solely to this
Agreement or any of the 

ancillary agreements or to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
agree that only the Sellers' Representative, acting on behalf of the Sellers,
shall be entitled to assert or waive such attorney-client privilege in
connection with such communications following the Closing Date. The files
generated and maintained by the Firm as a result of the Firm's representation
of the Company solely with respect to with this Agreement or any of the
ancillary agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
and become the exclusive property of the Sellers and shall be segregated from
the Firm's files related to all other elements of its representation of the
Company prior to the Closing Date (which shall remain the property of the
Company). The attorney-client privilege may be waived on behalf of the Sellers
only by the Sellers' Representative. The foregoing shall not extend to (a) any
communication unrelated to this Agreement, any of the ancillary agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) communications between the Sellers
or the Company, on the one hand, and any Person other than the Firm, on the
other hand regardless of whether the Firm was provided a copy, or (c) any
post-Closing Date communications between the Company and the Firm or any other
legal counsel.

10.18 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.18.
