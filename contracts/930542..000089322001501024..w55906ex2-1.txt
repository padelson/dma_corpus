52       - ii -   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 17, 2001, by and
among General Electric Company, a New York corporation ("Parent"), Margaret
Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Interlogix, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the Board of
Directors of Purchaser, and the Board of Directors of the Company, have
approved, and determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to consummate, the transactions
provided for herein; and   WHEREAS, to facilitate a merger between the
Company and Purchaser that qualifies as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent and the Purchaser have proposed acquiring
all of the outstanding Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company
(the "Shares" or "Company Common Stock") at a price (such price, or such
higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer (as defined herein), being
referred to herein as the "Offer Price") of $38.86 per Share, consisting of
(i) $19.43, in cash, and (ii) that number of shares of common stock, par
value $0.06, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio
(as defined herein); and   WHEREAS, after the acquisition of the Shares
described in the preceding clause and pursuant to the plan specified in this
Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Purchaser (the "Merger") with
Purchaser surviving the Merger; and   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and
Purchaser desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger; and   WHEREAS,
Parent desires to make certain agreements in connection with the Offer;
and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as a condition to Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into a Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof and the form of which is attached as
Exhibit A hereto (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which the stockholder
named therein (the "Stockholder") has agreed, among other things, to tender
all shares into the Offer and to not withdraw any such shares and to vote all
Shares subject to such Voting Agreement in favor of the Merger and this
Agreement and against any Takeover Proposal (as defined herein), subject to
and on the conditions set forth therein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND MERGER   Section 1.1. The Offer. (a) Provided
this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1
and so long as none of the events set forth on Annex A shall have occurred
and be continuing, as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10
Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, as the first step in completing the Merger, commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), an offer (the "Offer") to purchase all shares
of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock together with the
associated rights issued pursuant to the Rights Plan (as defined herein) (the
"Company Rights") for the Offer Price, subject only to the conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto; provided, however, that Parent may designate another
wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent as the bidder (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-1(g)(2) under the Exchange Act) in the Offer, in which case
reference herein to Purchaser shall be deemed to apply to such subsidiary, as
appropriate. Except where the context otherwise requires, all references
herein to Shares or Company Common Stock shall include the associated Company
Rights. The Company shall not tender Shares held by it or by any of
its subsidiaries pursuant to the Offer. The Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions of the Offer, accept for payment and pay for Shares
tendered as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under applicable law
and regulations. The obligations of the Purchaser to consummate the Offer and
to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior
to the expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject only to
the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Offer,
and in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock in the Offer (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would
be received by such stockholder) will be paid an amount in cash (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the fractional share interest to which such stockholder would otherwise be
entitled by (y) the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal) on the Acceptance Date.   (b) The Offer shall be made by means of
an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") containing the terms set forth
in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto and
providing for an initial expiration date (the "Expiration Date") of twenty
Business Days (as defined in Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act) from the date
of commencement of the Offer. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser not to,
decrease the Offer Price, change the form of consideration to be paid,
decrease the number of Shares sought, amend the conditions to the Offer set
forth in Annex A or impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set
forth in Annex A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the
Company, the Purchaser shall be entitled to and shall, and Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to, extend the Offer at any time for the shortest time periods
that it reasonably believes are necessary, if at the initial Expiration Date,
or any extension thereof, any condition to the Offer is not satisfied or
waived, provided that (i) no single extension shall exceed 10 Business Days
and (ii) Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the   
- 2 -  Outside Date (as defined herein). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer for
one or more periods of not more than 10 Business Days as required by any rule
or regulation of the SEC applicable to the Offer and (ii) if the Minimum
Condition (as defined herein) has been met but less than 90% of the
outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis (as defined in Annex A) shall
have been validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn as of the
scheduled or extended expiration date, extend the Offer after the acceptance
of Shares thereunder for a further period of time by means of a subsequent
offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act for an
aggregate period of not more than 20 Business Days beyond the latest
expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) of this
sentence. In addition, the Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be
extended to the extent required by law or the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with such increase in each case
without the consent of the Company.   (c) As soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the SEC\'s rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") a registration statement on
Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") to register the offer and sale of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. The Registration Statement will
include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under
Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide
Parent and the Purchaser all information reasonably requested by Parent or
the Purchaser for inclusion in the Offer Documents (as defined herein) and
any exhibits or annexes thereto. As soon as practicable, but not later than
the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent shall (i) file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of, and satisfy in all
material respects the requirements of, such Schedule TO and all applicable
federal securities laws, and will contain or incorporate by reference all or
part of the Registration Statement and the form of the related letter of
transmittal (such documents, together with the preliminary or
final prospectus included in the Registration Statement and any supplements
or amendments thereto, collectively the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and the
Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that it shall be, or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after its filing and to maintain such effectiveness
for so long as shall be required for the issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer. Following the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective, Parent shall file the final prospectus included therein
under Rule 424(b) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.   (d) Parent
shall include as exhibits to the Registration Statement tax opinions of
Dechert and Gibson Dunn and Crutcher LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and to the Company, on the basis of customary facts,
representations, warranties and covenants of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company and assumptions set forth in such opinions (including,
without limitation assumptions that (i) the Minimum Condition will be
satisfied and    - 3 -  (ii) the Merger will be completed promptly
following the Offer), to the effect that the Offer and the Merger will be
treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (together with the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Code").   (e) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Registration
Statement, the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents will be made by the
Company, Parent or the Purchaser, without providing the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. In addition,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser to, provide the Company and its
counsel in writing with any comments that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments and with copies of any written
responses and telephonic notification of any verbal responses by Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel. Parent will advise the Company promptly after it
receives notice that the Registration Statement and any supplement or
amendment that has been filed have become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Offer for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. If at any time prior to the time of consummation of the Offer,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent and which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.   (f) Parent shall issue or provide to
Purchaser all of the shares of Parent Common Stock necessary in connection
with the exchange of any shares of Company Common Stock to satisfy
Purchaser\'s obligations pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary in
connection with the purchase of any shares of Company Common Stock to satisfy
Purchaser\'s obligations pursuant to the Offer and the Merger.   Section
1.2. Company Actions.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer and represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly
called and held, has (i) unanimously adopted resolutions approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement (including all terms and conditions set
forth herein) and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger and the Voting Agreement and all of the transactions
contemplated thereby (collectively, the "Transactions"), determining that the
Merger is advisable and that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company\'s stockholders, (ii)
unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept
the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder to the Purchaser and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger; provided, that such recommendation may be
withdrawn, modified or amended by the Company\'s Board of Directors and (iii)
taken all action necessary so that the Company\'s Rights Agreement, dated as
of    - 4 -  November 27, 1996, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., as rights agent, as amended (as so amended, the "Rights Plan"), is and,
through the Effective Time (as defined herein), will be inapplicable to
Parent and the Purchaser, this Agreement, and the Transactions. The Company
represents that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") is inapplicable to the Transactions. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of its Board of
Directors described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence.   (b) Concurrently with the commencement of the Offer or as
promptly thereafter as practicable, the Company shall file with the SEC
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto,
the "Schedule 14D-9"), which shall contain the recommendation referred to in
clause (ii) of Section 1.2 (a) hereof unless such recommendation has been
withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified or amended, in each
case in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Parent and the
Purchaser shall provide the Company all information reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 and any exhibits or annexes
thereto. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with
the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company\'s
stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made
by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or the
Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company further shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, and shall mail such Schedule
14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company promptly after commencement of the
Offer, together with the initial mailing of the Offer to Purchase. Each of
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false
and misleading in any material respect and the Company further shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any correction
or amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In addition,
the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel in writing
with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments and with copies of any written responses and telephonic notification
of any verbal responses by the Company or its counsel.   (c) In connection
with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish
Purchaser with such additional information, including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
information and assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably
request in    - 5 -  communicating the Offer to the stockholders of the
Company. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and subject to the requirements of applicable law, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Purchaser and each of Purchaser\'s and Parent\'s
respective affiliates, associates, employees, agents and advisors to, hold in
confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists and the
additional information referred to in the preceding sentence, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this
Agreement is terminated, shall upon request of the Company deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Company all copies of such information then in its
possession or control or the possession or control of its agents or
representatives.   Section 1.3. Directors. Effective upon the Acceptance
Date of Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time thereafter as
Shares are acquired by Purchaser, Parent or their respective affiliates,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate upon written notice to the Company
for appointment or election such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give
Purchaser, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act,
representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to that number
of directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on
the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors
appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current
directors serving as officers of the Company) and (ii) the percentage that
the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser or any
of their respective affiliates (including for purposes of this Section 1.3
such Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding
Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) bears to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding. At such
times, if requested by Purchaser, and subject to applicable law and the rules
of the Nasdaq National Market, the Company will use its best efforts to cause
each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board
of Directors of each subsidiary of the Company to include persons designated
by Purchaser constituting the same percentage of each such committee and the
Board of Directors of each subsidiary of the Company as Purchaser\'s
designees are of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company shall,
upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company and/or exercise its best efforts to secure the
resignations of such number of Directors as is necessary to enable
Purchaser\'s designees to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company
in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.3 and subject to applicable
law, shall cause Purchaser\'s designees to be so elected; provided, however,
that if Purchaser\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Board of
Directors of the Company, until the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have at least two directors who are directors on the date
hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor designees, affiliates
or associates (within the meaning of the federal securities laws) of Parent
or the Purchaser prior to the date hereof (one or more of such directors, the
"Independent Directors"); provided further, that if less than two Independent
Directors remain, the remaining Independent Directors (if any) or if no
Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate persons to
fill the vacancies who shall not be either officers of the Company or
designees, shareholders, affiliates or associates of Parent, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders of
the Company promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an    - 6
-  amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1
if Purchaser has not theretofore designated directors) such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required
under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.3. Parent and Purchaser will supply the Company and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period after the election or appointment of directors designated
by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1.3 but prior to the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of the Company shall to the fullest extent permitted
by law delegate to a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
comprised solely of the Independent Directors (the "Committee"), the sole
responsibility for (i) the amendment or termination of this Agreement (in
either case in accordance with this Agreement) on behalf of the Company, (ii)
the waiver of any of the Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) the
extension of the time for performance of Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s
obligations hereunder, or (iv) the assertion or enforcement of the Company\'s
rights under this Agreement.   Section 1.4. The Merger. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, the Company and the Purchaser shall consummate as part of the
plan specified in this Agreement a merger (the "Merger") pursuant to which
(a) the Company shall be merged with and into the Purchaser and the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, (b) the Purchaser
shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") under the name "Margaret Acquisition, Inc." and shall continue
to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c) the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At
the Effective Time, (x) the certificate of incorporation of the Purchaser
(the "Purchaser Certificate of Incorporation") as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (y) the by-laws of the Purchaser (the "Purchaser
by-laws"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by
law, the Purchaser Certificate of Incorporation and the Purchaser by-laws.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.   Section 1.5.
Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser to, and the
Company shall cause an appropriate Certificate of Ownership and Merger or
Certificate of Merger, as the case may be (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
executed and filed on the date of the Closing (as defined herein) (or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") as provided in the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective on the date on which the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or such later time
as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
and such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."   Section
1.6. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than the second Business Day,
after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Dechert, 1717 Arch

Section 1.9. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. In the event
that Parent, the Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall acquire
at least ninety percent (90%) (on a fully-diluted basis) of the then-
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 (in lieu of Section 251) of the
DGCL.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1. Conversion
of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of Company Common
Stock or the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $.0l per share,
of the Purchaser (the "Purchaser Common Stock"):   (a) Purchaser Common
Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of the Purchaser Common Stock shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, $.0l par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.
All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock, all shares of Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, the Purchaser
or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent shall be automatically
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Shares. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) hereof and any Dissenting Shares (as
defined herein)), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of
cash and whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Offer Price payable
to the holder thereof, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). For
purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration (other than cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), the value of each share of Parent
Common Stock shall be the Average Share Price. All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right    - 9 -  to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without interest.   (d) Share Number
Adjustments. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but
prior to the Effective Time, the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, reclassification
stock combination, stock dividend, recapitalization, redenomination of share
capital or other similar transaction (or in the case of the Company, issuance
of stock pursuant to the Rights Plan), the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock paid in the Offer and the Merger and other items dependent thereon
shall be appropriately adjusted.   Section 2.2. Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent and
Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company (the "Exchange Agent")
reasonably acceptable to the Company to make the payments of the funds and
shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof. At the
Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) cash in the amount
necessary for the payment of the aggregate cash Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) the shares of Parent Common Stock necessary
for payment of the aggregate stock Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1. All funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be invested by
the Exchange Agent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors
Service, Inc., or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Services, or (iv) money market
funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be
payable to Purchaser or Parent, as Parent directs.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time but in no event more than three
Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted pursuant to Section
2.1 hereof into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (subject to subsection (g), below) for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper    - 10 -  form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.   (c) Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared,
made or paid after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(g) until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section
2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable as Merger
Consideration, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on
or after the Effective Time which theretofore became payable, but which were
not paid by reason of the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.
Dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender of Certificates by holders thereof payable in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent shall be
held in trust by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of such holders of
Certificates, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(e) hereof.   (d)
Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e)
Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following 180 calendar days
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) and any shares of Parent Common Stock that had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed
to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates such stockholder holds, as    - 11 -  determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (f) Withholding Taxes. If so specified in the Offer Documents
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to
the Offer or Merger such amounts as Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made.   (g) Fractional Shares. No certificate
or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Stock will be issued in the
Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional
Parent Common Stock will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of any such fractional
share of Parent Common Stock, each holder of Certificates who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for such Certificate (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder) pursuant to this Section 2.2(g) shall receive from
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, a cash payment rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, determined by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price of the
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (as reported in The
Wall Street Journal) on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective
Time.   Section 2.3. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent required by the DGCL,
shares of Company Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of
Company Common Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with
respect thereto (the "Dissenting Common Stock") in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and holders of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Dissenting Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Dissenting Common
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Dissenting Common Stock. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals or offer to settle or settle any such
demands, and Parent    - 12 -  shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.   Section 2.4.
Company Option Plans.   (a) Effective upon Closing, each unexercised option
to acquire Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") issued and
outstanding under the Company\'s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, the SLC
Technologies, Inc. Option Plan, the ITI Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Stock
Incentive Plan (1992), as amended and restated as of May 13, 1998, and any
other stock option plan or agreement of the Company (the "Company Option
Plans") will, on the Closing Date, be converted into an option (a "Converted
Option") to acquire, that number of shares of Common Stock of the Parent that
is equal, rounded up to the nearest whole share, to the product of twice the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares that could have been
acquired upon exercise of such Company Stock Option (without regard to actual
restrictions) had such Company Stock Option been exercised immediately before
Closing, with an exercise price equal to (x) the exercise price of the
Company Stock Option divided by (y) twice the Exchange Ratio.   (b) Between
the date of this Agreement and Closing, the Company\'s Board of Directors, or
the appropriate Committee thereof, will, at Parent\'s request, take such
action as may be necessary, consistent with the authority reserved to that
Board of Directors or Committee in the relevant Company Stock Option Plan, to
give effect to the conversion contemplated by Section 2.4(a), including
making any permitted determination regarding the vesting of any or
all Company Stock Options, or conforming the administrative rules and
procedures applicable to such Company Stock Options to those specified in
Parent\'s stock option plans, including, without limitation, the procedures
applicable in the event of an option holder\'s death, disability or other
termination of employment, provided that such changes do not materially
adversely affect the intrinsic value of any Company Stock Option so
amended.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
The Company represents and warrants to Parent and the Purchaser
as follows:   Section 3.1. Corporate Organization.   (a) The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and
authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below) on the Company ("Company Material Adverse Effect"). As
used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, an event,
change, effect    - 13 -  or occurrence which, individually or together
with any other event, change, effect or occurrence, has a material adverse
effect on the business, properties, net assets or results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or a
material adverse effect on the party\'s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the
disclosure schedule of the Company delivered to Parent concurrently herewith
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule") is a list of all subsidiaries of the
Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
subsidiary and the percentage of each such subsidiary\'s outstanding capital
stock or other ownership interests owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company. Each of the Company\'s subsidiaries is a corporation or entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries (as defined below) is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the SEC Documents (as
hereinafter defined), neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity
or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity (other than its wholly-owned
subsidiaries), (i) with respect to which interest the Company or a subsidiary
has invested (and currently owns) or is required to invest $5 million or
more, or (ii) which is a publicly-traded entity unless such interest is held
for investment by the Company or its subsidiary and comprises less than five
percent of the outstanding stock of such entity. As used in this Agreement,
the word "subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any
corporation, partnership or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of the Board
of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly beneficially
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries,
or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries.   Section 3.2.
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of its certificate of
incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and by-laws (the "Bylaws")
as amended to date (the "Company Charter Documents"), and will make available
to Parent, as promptly as practicable, the certificates of incorporation and
by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries
(the "Subsidiary Documents"). All such Company Charter Documents and
Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter Documents or the Subsidiary Documents, respectively,
except for violations that do not and are not reasonably likely to materially
interfere with the operations of such entity.     - 14 -   Section 3.3.
Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
60,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on
November 30, 2001, there were 19,569,072 Shares issued and outstanding. As of

set forth above or in Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or
(iii) as otherwise contemplated or permitted by Section 5.1(a) hereof, as of

will not be, any shares of capital stock issued and outstanding or any
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any securities of the
Company, including any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any Company Common Stock other than the Options referred to
above.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its

rights or claims and security interests whatsoever ("Liens") that would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and all of
such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the Company\'s subsidiaries has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
security of such subsidiary, including any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such subsidiary.   Section 3.4. Authority. (a) The
Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and subject to obtaining the approval of holders of a
majority of the Shares of Company Common Stock prior to the consummation of

consummation by it of the Transactions, have been duly authorized by its
Board of Directors, and, except for obtaining the approval of its

and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
or relating to the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and (ii) is
subject to general principles of equity.     - 15 -   (b) The Board of

best interests of, the Company\'s stockholders, and (ii) unanimously
recommending that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender
their Shares thereunder to the Purchaser and adopt this Agreement and the

3.6. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company has filed all
required reports, schedules, forms and registration statements with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 (collectively, and in each case including all

Documents, and none of the SEC Documents (including any and all financial

indicated in footnotes thereto or in the SEC Documents and (iii) that they

been or will be material) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then

31, 1997. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a private letter ruling
(the "Ruling") that the Spin-Off was tax-free pursuant to Section 355 of the
Code. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a supplemental private letter
ruling that the merger of SLC Technologies, Inc. into the Company, which

Spin-Off was tax-free to the distributing corporation and its shareholders

fail to so qualify.  As used herein, "Taxes" shall mean all taxes of any

3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no claims asserted or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries related to the safety of the products of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) All products of the Company and of each Company
subsidiary manufactured, processed, assembled, distributed, shipped or sold
and any services rendered in the conduct of the business of the Company or
any Company subsidiary have been in conformity with all applicable
contractual commitments and all express or implied warranties, except where
the failure to be in conformity could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All warranties of the Company and each
Company subsidiary are in conformity with the labeling and other requirements
of applicable Laws, except where any failure to be in conformity, either

Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.22. Insurance. All material
insurance policies of the Company and the Company subsidiaries (the

Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in material breach or default, and
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have taken any action or
failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or modification of
any of the Insurance Policies. No notice of cancellation or termination has
been received by the Company with respect to any such Insurance Policy. With
respect to each of the legal proceedings set forth in Section 3.8 in the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the SEC Documents, no carrier of
any Insurance Policy has asserted any denial of coverage. The Transactions
will not cause the    - 27 -   Insurance Policies not to remain in full
force and effect, and the Insurance Policies will not in any way be affected
by, and will not terminate or lapse by reason of, any of the
Transactions.   Section 3.23. Employee and Labor Relations.   (a) Except

contract affecting any employee, officer, or director of the Company pursuant
to which the Company has any liability.   (b) Except as set forth in Section
3.23(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no labor organization or group
of employees has been recognized or certified as representatives to the
Company for any current or former employees of the Company. No labor
organization or group of employees of the Company has made a pending demand
for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or threatened in writing to be brought or filed with the

Disclosure Schedule, there are no strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns,
lockouts, arbitrations, grievances, or other labor disputes pending or
threatened in writing against or involving the Company. There has been

forth in Section 3.23(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
material pending allegations that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has
violated, any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law or any
governmental rule or regulation, or any order, ruling, decree, judgment or

or otherwise, on account of or for: (i) overtime pay, other than overtime pay
for the current payroll period; (ii) wages or salary for any period other
than the current payroll period; (iii) vacation, time off or pay in lieu of

relating to payment of wages and fringe benefits, minimum wages or maximum
work hours except, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iv) above,
where such claim would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.    -28-   (d) Section 3.23(d) of the Company Disclosure

$100,000 or more and the job title of each such employee.   ARTICLE IV

Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions.   Section 4.2.
Capitalization. The Parent Common Stock to be delivered as part of the Offer
Price and Merger Consideration has been duly authorized and, when issued and
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have been

and delivery hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of each
of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or

Governmental Entity or the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. are necessary for
the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the Transactions, other than such
other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if
not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be expected to materially
delay Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s performance of their respective material
obligations under this Agreement or to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent or Purchaser, nor the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the
Transactions, nor compliance by Parent or Purchaser with any of the terms or

or any of their respective subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in
the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, losses, terminations of rights thereof, accelerations or Lien
creations which would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.5. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.
Parent has filed all required reports, schedules, forms and registration
statements with the SEC since January 1, 1998 (collectively, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the "Parent SEC Documents") which are all reports,
schedules, forms and statements (other than preliminary material) that Parent
was required to file with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the Parent
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents (including any and all
financial statements included therein) as of such dates contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The    -30-  consolidated financial statements of the Parent included in
the Parent SEC Documents (the "Parent SEC Financial Statements") comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Since
December 31, 2000, neither the Parent nor any of its subsidiaries, has
incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required, if known, to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Parent prepared in
accordance with GAAP except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited
balance sheet of the Parent and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000
(including the notes thereto), (ii) as incurred in connection with
the Transactions, (iii) as incurred after December 31, 2000 in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice, (iv) as described in
the SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2000, or (v) as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 4.6. Parent or Purchaser Information. The information relating
to Parent and its subsidiaries to be provided by Parent to be contained in
the Offer Documents and the Registration/Prospectus Statement, if any, or in
any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection
herewith, at the respective time filed with the SEC or such other
Governmental Entity and, in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, if any, at the date it or any amendment or supplement
is mailed to holders of the Shares, at the time of the Special Meeting and at
the Effective Time, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Offer
Documents and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, if any (except that no
representation is made as to such portions thereof that relate only to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or to statements made therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion therein) will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, respectively.   Section 4.7. Financing. Parent and the Purchaser
collectively have and will have at the Expiration Date and at the Effective
Time, and Parent will make available to the Purchaser, sufficient funds to
enable the Purchaser to pay that portion of the Offer Price and Merger
Consideration to be paid for all outstanding Shares purchased pursuant to the
Offer or converted into cash and Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger,
to perform Parent\'s and the Purchaser\'s obligations under this Agreement
and to pay all fees and expenses related to the Transactions payable by
them.   Section 4.8. Stock Ownership. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor the Purchaser beneficially owns any Shares.   Section 4.9. Purchaser
Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Purchaser consists of
1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 500 shares
have    -31-  been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned by Parent free and clear of any Liens.   Section 4.10.
Purchaser\'s Operation. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and has not engaged in any business activities
or conducted any operations other than in connection with
the Transactions.   Section 4.11. Broker\'s Fees. Except as disclosed in
Section 4.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any
subsidiary of Parent nor any of its respective officers or directors on
behalf of Parent or such subsidiaries has employed any financial advisor,
broker or finder in a manner that would result in any liability of the
Company for any broker\'s fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.12. Tax
Matters. Neither the Parent nor any of its subsidiaries have taken any action
or failed to take any action that would cause the Offer and the Merger to
fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code, and no facts exist that would cause the Offer and the Merger to fail to
so qualify.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS   Section 5.1. Conduct of Business
by the Company Prior to the Effective Time. Except as set forth in Section
5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement, or as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, during the

capital stock; provided that the Company may grant options to employees hired
after the date hereof to the extent available for grant under   
-32-  the Company\'s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan as it is in effect on the
date hereof; provided, further, that such additional options provide that the

hereof other than pursuant to (x) the exercise of stock options or warrants
or conversion rights outstanding as of the date hereof and (y) acquisitions

its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives to cease, any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and use its best efforts to obtain the
return from all such parties or cause the destruction of all copies of
confidential information provided to such parties by the Company or its
representatives that are still in the possession of such parties. From the
date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its subsidiaries not to, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit or knowingly encourage the initiation of
(including by way of furnishing information that has not been previously
publicly disseminated) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate
in any discussions regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
information with respect to, or assist or facilitate any Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that if, prior to the Effective Time and following the
receipt of a Takeover Proposal that was made in circumstances not
otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of
state law and after consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by it of its fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable law, the Company may, in response
to such Takeover Proposal and subject to compliance with Section 5.2(b), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company to the party making such
Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (but no
less favorable to the Company than the confidentiality agreement entered into
with Parent), provided that (i) such confidentiality agreement must include
a provision prohibiting solicitation of key employees of the Company or
its subsidiaries, such provision lasting at least one year, and may not
include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company and (ii) the Company advises Parent of all such nonpublic information
delivered to such person concurrently with its delivery to the requesting
party, and (y) participate in negotiations with such party regarding such
Takeover Proposal, and (z) prior to the Acceptance Date, following receipt of
an unsolicited, bona fide Takeover Proposal from a third party which is a
Superior Proposal, enter into an agreement with such third   
-34-  party and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii)
hereof, if after duly considering the advice of outside counsel, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
stockholders under applicable law.   (b) In addition to the obligations of
the Company set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.2, and subject to
the terms of any confidentiality agreement signed prior to the date hereof,
the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 48 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry, or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, indicate the identity of the person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry, or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals or offers or the status
of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall not release any
person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement entered into as of the date of this Agreement.   (c) (i) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal
or offer from any person (other than Parent and its subsidiaries, affiliates,
and representatives) relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of assets of the Company and its subsidiaries equal to 15% or more
of the Company\'s consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the
Company\'s revenues of earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, or
(B) any direct or indirect acquisition of 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or, (D) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries equal to 15% or more of the
Company\'s consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the Company\'s
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (ii) "Superior Proposal"
means a bona fide written proposal obtained not in breach of this Agreement
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the Company or
substantially all of the assets of the Company made by a third party on terms
and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its
good faith and reasonable judgment after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel to be more favorable (other than in immaterial
respects) from a financial point of view than the Offer or the Merger and the
Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination any changes to
the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent
and the ability of the Person making such Superior Proposal to
consummate such Takeover Proposal (based upon, among other things, the
availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required
regulatory approvals).   (d) Communication of Restrictions. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the officers, directors
and employees of the Company and of each    -35-  subsidiary of the
Company and any investment banker or other advisor or representative retained
by the Company are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 5.2,
and the failure of such officers, directors, employees, investment bankers or
other advisors or representatives to comply with the provisions hereof shall
be deemed to be a breach by the Company of this Agreement, unless such person
or entity is acting outside the scope of their authority.   (e) Agreement
With Others. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall (i) permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement or (ii) permit the Company to enter into any written
agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal during the term of this
Agreement (it being agreed that during the term of this Agreement the Company
shall not enter into any written agreement with any person that provides for,
or in any way facilitates, a Takeover Proposal, other than a confidentiality
agreement in the form referred to above), it being understood that Section
7.1(c) (ii) sets forth the sole right of the Company to terminate this
Agreement in the circumstances specified in Section 5.2(a). Section
5.3. Intentionally Omitted.   Section 5.4. Financing. On the date hereof
and at all times on or prior to the consummation of the Offer, Parent and the
Purchaser shall have sufficient funds available (through cash on hand and
existing credit arrangements) to purchase all of the Shares outstanding on a
fully diluted basis and to pay all fees and expenses related to the
Transactions.   Section 5.5. Publicity. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except as may be
required by law or by any listing agreement with Nasdaq or a national
securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party
wanting to make such release, neither the Company, Parent nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consultation of the
other party.   Section 5.6. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation or
warranty made by the party delivering the notice contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) any material failure of the party delivering the
notice to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   Section 5.7. Access to Information.   (a) Upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
Parent, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, reasonable access to all its    -36-  properties (provided,
however, that if in the process of confirmatory due diligence information
received by Parent regarding an existing environmental event, circumstance or
condition that would reasonably be likely to be material and adverse to the
Company, then with the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld) (it being understood that neither Parent nor the
Purchaser believes that such an environmental event, circumstance or
condition exists that would reasonably be likely to be material and
adverse to the Company), Parent and its representatives may conduct "Phase
II" or other environmental testing or sampling; provided, however, that if
permitted to do sampling or testing, Parent\'s representatives shall not
unreasonably interfere with or otherwise disrupt the business or operations
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries while conducting such testing or
sampling), books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, make
available to the Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities laws (other than reports
or documents which the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the work product privilege of the
entity in possession or control of such information or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
(b) The information provided pursuant to Section 5.7(a) will be used solely
for the purpose of the Transactions, and unless and until the Merger

Further Assurances.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, use all reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its subsidiaries
with respect to the Transactions and, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VI hereof, to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable
and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions, and to
comply with the terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization,
order or approval.   (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall duly file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing")
required under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as   
-37-  promptly as practical, but in no event later than the seventh Business
Day following the date hereof. The HSR Filings shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate
with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the
preparation of its HSR Filing, to request early termination of the waiting
period required by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly amend or
furnish additional information thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company
shall as promptly as practicable, comply with the Foreign Antitrust Laws.
Parent and the Company shall furnish to each other all such information as is
necessary to prepare any such registration, declaration or filing. Parent and
the Company each shall pay the filing fees with respect to the HSR Filing
filed by it and any other such registration, declaration or filing. Parent
and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Parent
shall be under any obligation to litigate before or with, or contest any
order or decree, or defend against any such actions or proceedings commenced
by any Governmental Entity in respect of the antitrust, competition, merger
control or similar laws and rules or regulations, and (ii) neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be obligated to propose or
agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent
decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or
take or commit to take any action that could reasonably be expected to limit
(A) the freedom of action of Parent or its subsidiaries or Affiliates with
respect to the operation of, or Parent\'s or its subsidiaries\' or
Affiliates\' ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines
or assets of the Company, or (B) the ability to retain, own or operate any
portion of the businesses, product lines, or assets, of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or
commercial practices of the Company, Parent or its subsidiaries or
Affiliates. If any such party or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as possible and after
consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of any
material communication from the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the
Transactions.   Section 5.9. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Compensation
and Benefits. For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Company\'s
employees pay and benefits and benefit plans, programs and policies,
including, without limitation, severance benefits, medical and welfare plans,
which are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the
Company on the date hereof and agrees to waive any waiting periods
or limitations for preexisting conditions under its medical, dental, and
short-term and long-term disability plans and shall ensure that employees are
given credit for any amounts paid toward deductibles, out-of-pocket limits or
other fees on or prior to the Effective Time. Employees shall also be
provided credit by Purchaser for all service with the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, under (x) all employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and    -38-  fringe benefits to be provided to
such employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting and (y) severance
plans, programs and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each
Employee\'s severance benefits.   (b) Employment Agreements. Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to discharge the obligations under each
employment agreement listed in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (c) Collective Bargaining Agreements. Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor the terms of any collective
bargaining agreements covering any employees of the Company and will
recognize any labor organization or other collective bargaining
representative of such employees, as required in accordance with the National
Labor Relations Act or any other applicable law.   Section 5.10.
Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or
who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") (x) to the
same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and its subsidiaries
pursuant to the Company Charter Documents, the Subsidiary Documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof and set
forth in Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule with any directors
and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and (y) without limitation
to clause (x), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against (i)
any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pertaining to any action or
omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
("Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, however, that, in the case of
the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation such indemnification shall only
be to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under the DGCL
to indemnify its own directors and officers. The Surviving Corporation will
pay all reasonable expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the
final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section
145(e) of the DGCL. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel of their choice reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided
that Parent shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (other than local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties
in any single claim except to the extent that any of    -39-  the
Indemnified Parties have defenses available to them that are not available to
the other Indemnified Parties, in which case Parent shall pay the fees
and expenses of separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) for such
Indemnified Parties, and (iii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense
of any such matter, provided that none of Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without
its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the
failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 5.10 except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Surviving
Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e) of the DGCL.  
(b) Parent shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, for a period of six
years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors\'
and officers\' and company liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries (provided that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor one or more
policies of substantially the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insureds
(which are the Company, its subsidiaries, their respective officers and
directors, Berwind Corporation, Berwind Group Partners, and Berwind LLC) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for such insurance in excess of $600,000 provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.   (c) Each Indemnified Party and each "insured" under the
current directors\' and officers\' and company liability insurance policy
maintained by the Company is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
Section 5.10 and may specifically enforce its terms.   Section 5.11.
Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Parent.   Section 5.12. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
the Transactions, including any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to the Company Common Stock)
and acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in
accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC
regarding such matters.    -40-   Section 5.13. No Redemption of Rights
Plan. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not (a) redeem,
amend or waive any provisions of the Rights Plan (other than such amendments
as are necessary to accommodate this Agreement and the Transactions, but not
with respect to any Takeover Proposal) or (b) implement or adopt any so-
called "poison pill," shareholder rights plan or other similar plan.  
Section 5.14. Affiliate Letters. As promptly as practicable, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who are at
the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the
Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the expiration of the Offer, an
affiliate letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B from each such
person.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS   Section 6.1. Conditions to Each

Company\'s Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3 of this Agreement and

pursuant to the Offer.   ARTICLE VII   TERMINATION   Section 7.1.

reasonably be  expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect) or, if
qualified by  Parent Material Adverse Effect, such representations and
warranties shall  not be true and correct as so qualified, as of the date of
this Agreement  and as of the Expiration Date as if made on such date, or
either Parent or  Purchaser shall have breached or failed in any material

the extent expressly made as of an earlier date,  in which case as of such

provided that no payment made by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3
shall operate or be construed as a waiver by the Company of any breach of
this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser or of any rights of the Company in
respect thereof.   (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to paragraph

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer
(subject to the provisions of the Agreement), as a first step in effectuating
a merger between Purchaser and Company qualifying as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, the Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to the Purchaser\'s obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may
delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred
to above, the payment for, any tendered Shares, and may terminate the Offer
and not accept for payment any tendered shares if (i) there shall not have
been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
such number of Shares which would constitute at least a majority of the
Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis on the date of purchase (on
a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of Shares outstanding, together
with the Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to
options or obligations outstanding at that date and which do not terminate
upon consummation of the Offer under employee stock or similar benefit plans
or otherwise, whether or not vested or then exercisable), when aggregated
with any Shares owned by Parent, the Purchaser or an affiliate of Parent or
the Purchaser (the "Minimum Condition"), (ii) any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, and under all Foreign Antitrust Laws where the expiration
or termination of the waiting period is necessary, has not expired or
terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer, or (iii) at any time on or
after the date of the Agreement, and before the time of acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer, any of the following events shall occur
and be continuing:   (a) there shall be any action, proceeding or litigation
threatened, instituted or pending by any Governmental Entity that seeks to
and which would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent, prohibit or make
illegal Parent\'s or the Purchaser\'s ownership or operation of all or a
material portion of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' businesses and
assets taken as a whole, (ii) prevent, prohibit, or make illegal the
acceptance for payment, payment for or purchase of Shares by the Purchaser or
the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) renders the Purchaser unable to

imposes material limitations on the ability of the Purchaser or Parent
effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including,
without limitation, the right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all
matters properly presented to the Company\'s stockholders, or (v) imposes,
as a result of the Transactions, damages on Parent that are material to
Parent, and provided, that the failure of any condition to be satisfied is
not primarily due to the failure by Parent and/or Purchaser to comply with
the terms of this Agreement.   (b) there shall have been any statute, rule,
regulation, order, legislation or interpretation enacted, promulgated,
amended, entered or issued applicable to (i) Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or any of their respective subsidiaries or an Affiliate of either Parent or
the Company or (ii) the Transactions, by any United States or non-United
States legislative body or Governmental Entity with appropriate jurisdiction
(other than the routine application of the waiting period provisions of the

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where failure to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes
of paragraph (c)(ii), (A) a Company Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed
to have occurred if but only if the applicable event, change, effect, or
occurrence (or aggregation thereof) would be reasonably likely to (x) result
in liability to Company (or its subsidiaries) or diminution in the value of
the Company (including its subsidiaries) (including but not limited to, as a
result of a diminution of the revenues, earnings or net asset value of the
Company (including its subsidiaries)) of US $100,000,000 or more in the
aggregate, taking into account available insurance proceeds payable to the
Company or its subsidiaries, and (B) a Company Material Adverse Effect shall
not include any event, change, effect or occurrence (or aggregation thereof)
that occurs or would be reasonably likely to occur as a result of any
general, national, international or regional economic or financial condition
or (y) have a material adverse effect on the parties\' ability to consummate

the declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in
respect of banks by a United States Governmental Entity;   (e) the
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;   (f)
the Registration Statement shall have not become effective under the

Purchaser and Parent and may be asserted by either of them regardless or the
circumstances giving rise to such conditions or may be waived by Parent or
the Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the
sole discretion of Parent or the Purchaser. The failure by Parent or the
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be
deemed a waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any
particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect
to any other facts or circumstances, and each right will be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.    A-2  
Should the Offer be terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all
tendered Shares not theretofore accepted for payment shall forthwith
be returned to the tendering stockholders.    A-3   Exhibit A   VOTING

and that provided this Agreement has not been terminated, it shall not

Stockholder Shares or cause them to be voted or execute written consents in
respect thereof (i) in favor of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and the Transactions; (ii)

material respect of any covenant or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company under the Merger Agreement or in a breach in any material respect of
any representation or warranty of the Company in the Merger Agreement; (iii)
against any Takeover Proposal; and (iv) against any amendment of the Company
Charter Documents or any other action or agreement that is intended or could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
discourage the Offer or the Merger or change in any manner the voting rights
of any class of the Company Common Stock. Stockholder agrees not to assert
any statutory appraisal rights it may have under the DGCL in connection with
the Merger.   2. Representation and Warranties of the Parent and Purchaser.

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Authority. Each of Parent and Purchaser has
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly authorized and approved by their Boards of Directors and by Parent as
the sole stockholder of Purchaser, and no other corporate action on the part
of Parent and Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the
consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Each of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Purchaser, and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto or thereto, is a
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable

registrations with, any Governmental Entity or the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. are required to be obtained or made by Parent or Purchaser in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations

Merger Agreement or to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. In addition,
the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Offer and the
Merger is subject to the approval of such Parent Common Stock for listing on
the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, which
approval Parent shall obtain promptly after commencement of the Offer and in
any case prior to the Expiration Date.   (ii) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement by Parent or Purchaser,
nor the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Parent or Purchaser with any of the
terms or provisions hereof or thereof, will (A) conflict with or violate any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or any of
the similar organizational documents of Purchaser or any of Parent\'s or
Purchaser\'s subsidiaries or (B) assuming that the authorizations, consents
and approvals referred to in Section 2(c)(i) are obtained, (x) violate any

lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent, Purchaser
or any of their respective subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in
the case of clause (B) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, losses, terminations of rights thereof, accelerations or Lien
creations which would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement.   (d) Financing. Parent and the Purchaser collectively
have and will have at the Expiration Date, at the Effective Time and so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated, and Parent will make available to
the Purchaser, sufficient funds to enable the    3  Purchaser to pay

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder, nor the performance
by Stockholder of its obligations hereunder, will (A) conflict with or
violate any provision of any organizational document of Stockholder or (B)
assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in
Section 3(c)(i) are obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to
Stockholder or any of its properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict
with, result in the loss of any material benefit under, constitute a default
(or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or

instrument or obligation to which Stockholder is a party, or by which it or
any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the
case of clause (B) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
losses, terminations of rights thereof, accelerations or Lien creations which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Stockholder or a material adverse effect on the ability of Stockholder to
perform its obligations hereunder.   (d) Brokers. No broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any broker\'s,
finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission that is
payable by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement based upon the arrangements made by or
on behalf of Stockholder (it being understood that the Company, as described
in Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, has engaged UBS as the
Company\'s financial advisor).   4. Certain Covenants of Stockholder. Except
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants
and agrees as follows:   (a) Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-
Interference. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Stockholder shall
not (i) except as contemplated by this Agreement, sell, transfer, give,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract,
option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale,
transfer, gift, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any
of the Stockholder Shares (each of the foregoing, a "Transfer"), (ii) grant
any proxies, deposit any Stockholder Shares into a voting trust or enter into
a voting agreement, power of attorney or voting trust with respect to any of
the Stockholder Shares or (iii) take any action that would make any
representation or warranty of Stockholder contained herein untrue or
incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing or
disabling Stockholder from performing Stockholder\'s obligations under this
Agreement.   (b) Additional Shares. Prior to the termination of
this Agreement, Stockholder will promptly notify the Purchaser of the number
of any new Shares acquired    5  directly or beneficially by
Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof. Any such shares shall become
Stockholder Shares for purposes of this Agreement.   (c) Nonsolicitation.
From the date hereof until the termination hereof, Stockholder, in its
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, will not, and will not authorize or
knowingly permit any investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
and other agents or advisors (collectively, "Representatives") of Stockholder
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, or knowingly encourage or initiate
the submission of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) engage in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect
to, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may be reasonably expected to
lead to, any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that the Stockholder may
furnish such information to and engage in such discussions or negotiations
with such person regarding a Takeover Proposal if at such time the Company is
permitted under the Merger Agreement to provide information and engage in
discussions or negotiations with such person regarding a Takeover
Proposal.   (d) Notice. Stockholder will notify Parent promptly (but in
no event later than 48 hours) in writing if any person shall make a proposal
or inquiry, or contact Stockholder, relating to the acquisition of
beneficial ownership of any Stockholder Shares. The notice shall state the
identity of the person and the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, inquiry or contact. Stockholder shall keep Parent reasonably
apprised of any material development with respect to such proposal.
Stockholder shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations, if any,
with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal.   (e) Conduct of
Stockholder. (i) Stockholder shall not adopt any plan of complete or partial
liquidation, dissolve, merge or combine with any person or entity, or permit
any change in the beneficial ownership interests of Stockholder and (ii)
Stockholder shall maintain its status as a duly organized and validly
existing limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that
Parent may withhold its consent if in its judgment permitting the
requested action would jeopardize the benefits intended to be provided to it
under the Agreement.   5. Recapture of Profits. If (A) the Merger Agreement
is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) of the Merger
Agreement and (B) within nine (9) months after the date of such termination,
Stockholder consummates the sale, transfer or other disposition for value of
any or all of its Stockholder Shares to or with any person or entity not an
affiliate or associate of Parent, Purchaser or the Company (but including a
sale to the Company if such sale is a transactional element of a Takeover
Proposal) (i) in connection with a Takeover Proposal or (ii) in a transaction
or series of related transactions which would reasonably be expected to lead
to or facilitate the making or consummation of a Takeover Proposal (such
sale, transfer or other disposition of Stockholder Shares being collectively
referred to as an    6  "Alternative Disposition"), and (C) within nine
(9) months after the date of such termination of the Merger Agreement such
Takeover Proposal or any other Takeover Proposal is consummated, then the
Stockholder shall, within three Business Days of the closing of such Takeover
Proposal, pay to Parent, the amount of the Profit, if any, realized by
Stockholder from such Alternative Disposition, net of Stockholder\'s
reasonably documented expenses in connection with such Alternative
Disposition, any taxes incurred by Stockholder on such Profit and any legal
fees incurred by Stockholder in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement; provided, however, that the sale by
Stockholder of any of its Stockholder Shares pursuant to an underwritten
public offering (so long as at the time of the closing of such public
offering there has not been publicly announced and pending a
Takeover Proposal and Stockholder does not have actual knowledge of a planned
Takeover Proposal) or a sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act shall
not be considered an Alternative Disposition which is subject to the
provisions of this Section 5. As used in this Section, "Profit" shall be
calculated on a per Share basis and shall mean an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of the per Share proceeds received by Stockholder in such Alternative
Disposition over the per Share Offer Price (or such higher price as Parent or
its affiliates may offer for the Shares). Any such Profits received by
Stockholder on such Alternative Disposition will be paid to Parent in the
same form and in the same proportion as was received by Stockholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, under no
circumstances shall the Stockholder be required to pay to Parent an amount
which would result in Stockholder retaining from such Alternative Disposition
an amount less than Stockholder would have received had the Merger Agreement
been consummated.   6. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.  
(a) Subject to the last sentence of subsection (c) hereunder, Stockholder
hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent and each of its designees
(individually, an "Authorized Party" and, collectively, the "Authorized
Parties"), and each of them individually, as Stockholder\'s proxy
and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name,
place and stead of Stockholder, to vote the Stockholder Shares, or execute
one or more written consents or approvals in respect of the Stockholder
Shares, (i) in favor of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
the approval of the terms thereof and the Transactions; (ii) against any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of
any covenant or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the
Merger Agreement or in a breach in any material respect of any representation
or warranty of the Company in the Merger Agreement; (iii) against any
Takeover Proposal; and (iv) against any amendment of the Company Charter
Documents or any other action or agreement that is intended or could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
discourage the Offer or the Merger or change in any manner the voting rights
of any class of the Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, such irrevocable proxy will not be exercised by any
Authorized Party unless Stockholder breaches its obligations under Section
1(b) of this Agreement.    7   (b) Stockholder represents that any
proxies heretofore given in respect of the Stockholder Shares are revocable,
and that any such proxies have been or are hereby revoked.   (c)
Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 6 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement
and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the
duties of Stockholder in accordance with this Agreement. Stockholder
hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy granted hereby is coupled
with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. Stockholder hereby ratifies and
confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done
by virtue hereof. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be
irrevocable prior to termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 212(e) of the DGCL. Such irrevocable proxy shall be
valid until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this irrevocable
proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this
Agreement.   (d) Any action taken by any such party pursuant to the
proxy granted under this Section 6(a) shall provide that Stockholder may
revoke such action effective upon termination of this Agreement.   7.
Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of any other party and
without further consideration, each party hereto shall execute and deliver
such additional documents and take all such further action as may
be reasonably required to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Offer and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.   8. Certain
Events. Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to the Stockholder Shares and shall be binding upon any person
or entity to which legal or beneficial ownership of such Stockholder Shares
shall pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise, including
Stockholder\'s administrators or successors. In the event of any stock split,
stock dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other change in
the capital structure of the Company affecting the Company Common Stock
or other voting securities of the Company, the number of Stockholder Shares
shall be deemed adjusted appropriately and this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional shares of Company Common
Stock or other voting securities of the Company issued to or acquired by
Stockholder.   9. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the first
to occur of (a) the day after any of the Shares are accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer, provided that the Stockholder has complied with its
agreements contained in Section 1(a); (b) the Effective Time; (c) the
termination of the Merger Agreement; and (d) 180 calendar days after the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the provisions of Section 10
(Miscellaneous) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) if
this Agreement is terminated as the consequence of the termination of the
Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) of the    8  Merger
Agreement, the provisions of Section 5 (Recapture of Profits) and
Section 4(e) (Conduct of Stockholder) shall survive termination of this
Agreement and shall terminate (a) nine (9) months after termination of the
Merger Agreement, if no Alternative Disposition has occurred within such nine
(9) months or (b) at such time as Stockholder has discharged its obligations
under Section 5 hereof, if an Alternative Disposition has occurred within
nine (9) months after termination of the Merger Agreement. Stockholder shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Parent if the
terms of the Merger Agreement or the Offer are amended or waived without the
written consent of Stockholder, but only if such amendment or waiver creates
any additional condition to the Offer, reduces the Offer Price or the Merger
Consideration, changes the form or mix of the Offer Price or Merger
Consideration or otherwise adversely affects Stockholder; provided that for
the purposes of this sentence, the term "Merger Agreement" shall mean the
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company of even date herewith, as in effect on the date hereof, and
capitalized terms used in this sentence shall have the meaning given such
terms therein.   10. Miscellaneous.   (a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.   (b) Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that the Parent may
assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights hereunder to any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; provided that any such
assignment would not cause any delay in the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger; and provided further that no such assignment shall relieve Parent of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.   (c) Amendments. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented, except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.   (d) Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America located in the
State of Delaware (the "Delaware Courts") for any litigation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement (and agrees not to commence counterclaims
except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
such litigation in the Delaware    9  Courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum.   (e) Specific Performance. Each of the
parties hereto recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by it of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement will cause the other
party to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at
law for money damages, and therefore in the event of any such breach the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of
such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in
equity.   (f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.   (g) Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings used
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  
(h) Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.   (i) Notices. All notices,
requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person,

12   Exhibit A  1. Pursuant to a Voting Agreement dated May 2, 2000 by and
among Stockholder (as successor in interest to Berwind Group Partners),
Thomas L. Auth and MLGA Fund II, LP, Stockholder agreed, subject to the terms
of such Voting Agreement, to vote all shares owned by it to elect Thomas Auth
as a director of the Company, and to require any transferee of its shares to
agree to be bound by the Voting Agreement. Stockholder has entered into an
agreement with Mr. Auth to terminate the Voting Agreement effective at the
Acceptance Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement).    13   Exhibit
B  December __, 2001  _______________ Company 3135 Eastern Turnpike,
W3A Fairfield, Connecticut 06431  Ladies and Gentlemen:   The undersigned
has been advised that as of the date of this letter it may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of ___________, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as
defined in Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), although
nothing herein shall be deemed an admission that the undersigned is an
affiliate. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of ___________, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among [ ], a New York
corporation ("Parent"), [___________ Company], a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition"), and the
Company, Acquisition will offer (the "Offer") to purchase all outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Shares") and, assuming certain conditions are met, the Company will be
merged and into Acquisition (the "Merger" and together with the Offer, the
"Transactions").   As a result of the Transactions, the undersigned will
receive cash and shares of common stock, par value $[.06] per share (the
"Securities"), of Parent in exchange for the Shares owned by the undersigned
and tendered the Offer or received pursuant to the Merger.   The
undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that:   (a) The
undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other  disposition of the
Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and  Regulations
thereunder.   (b) The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the
Merger  Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and
other  applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or
otherwise  dispose of the Securities, to the extent the undersigned felt
necessary,  with my counsel or counsel for the Company.   (c) The
undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Securities  to it pursuant
to the Transactions has been registered with the SEC under  the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the undersigned  has also been
advised that because the undersigned may be deemed to be an  affiliate of the
Company and the distribution by me of the Securities has  not been registered
under the Act, the undersigned may not sell, transfer  or otherwise dispose
of the Securities issued to me in the Merger unless  such sale, transfer or
other disposition (i) has been registered under the  Act, (ii) is made in
conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under  the Act or (iii) in
the opinion of legal counsel reasonably acceptable to  Parent, or pursuant to
a "no   action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the
SEC, is  otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.   (d) The
understand, that Parent is under no obligation to register  the sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Securities received by it  or on it\'s
behalf as a result of the Transactions under the Act.   By Parent\'s
acceptance of this letter Parent hereby agrees with the undersigned that
Parent will (a) use its best reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a timely
basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Commission by it
pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"1934 Act"), and (ii) furnish to the undersigned upon request a written
statement as to whether the Parent has complied with such reporting
requirements during the 12 months preceding any proposed sale of the
Securities by me under Rule 144 and (b) otherwise use its reasonable best
efforts to permit such sales pursuant to Rule 144, so as to permit the sale
or other disposition of Securities by the undersigned under Rule 145 in
accordance with the terms thereof.   Very truly yours,
