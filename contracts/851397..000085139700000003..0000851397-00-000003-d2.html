articles of merger (the &quot;Effective Time&quot;).

<strong><P>1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers</strong>.  Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time:
<OL TYPE="a">

<P><LI>the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit
B;</LI>
<P><LI>the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and</LI>
<P><LI>the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.</LI></OL>

<strong><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp Conversion of Shares</strong>.
<OL TYPE="a">

<P><LI>At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:</LI>
<OL TYPE="i">

<P><LI>any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company's treasury) (together
with any associated Rights, as defined in Section 2.3) shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;</LI>
<P><LI>any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (together with any associated Rights)
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;</LI>
<P><LI>except as provided in clauses &quot;(i)&quot; and &quot;(ii)&quot; above
and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), each share of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (together with any associated Rights) shall be converted
into the right to receive 0.649 of a share of Parent Common Stock; and</LI>
<P><LI>each share of the common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub then
outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.</LI></OL>

<P>The fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock specified in clause
&quot;(iii)&quot; of the preceding sentence (as such fraction may be adjusted in
accordance with Section 1.5(b)) is referred to as the &quot;Exchange
Ratio.&quot;
<P><LI>If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.</LI>
<P><LI>If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any
rights, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with
appropriate legends.  The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise
any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.</LI>
<P><LI>No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued.  Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in
cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date the Merger becomes
effective.</LI></OL>

<strong><P>1.6 &nbsp; &nbsp Closing of the Company's Transfer Books</strong>.  At the
Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common
Stock (a &quot;Company Stock Certificate&quot;) is presented to the Exchange
Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.7.

<strong><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.7 &nbsp; &nbsp Exchange of Certificates</strong>.
<OL TYPE="a">

<P><LI>On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the &quot;Exchange
Agent&quot;).  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d).  The shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with
respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the &quot;Exchange
Fund.&quot;</LI>
<P><LI>As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing Parent Common Stock.  Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate
to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock)
as contemplated by this Section 1.  If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to
provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.</LI>
<P><LI>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in
exchange for any Company Stock Certificate to any Person who may be an
&quot;affiliate&quot; (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities
Act) of the Company until such Person shall have delivered to Parent a duly
executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.10.</LI>
<P><LI>No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends
and distributions, without interest).</LI>
<P><LI>Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the
Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter
look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.</LI>
<P><LI>Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or
under any other applicable Legal Requirement.  To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.</LI>
<P><LI>Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal
Requirement. </LI></OL>

<strong><P>1.9 &nbsp; &nbsp Accounting Consequences</strong>.  For financial reporting
purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as a &quot;pooling of
interests.&quot;

<strong><P>1.10 &nbsp; &nbsp Further Action</strong>.  If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.</OL>

circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time)
will, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery
to any Person of any Acquired Corporation Source Code or the release from any
escrow of any other Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset.  Part 2.9(e)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract pursuant to which the
Company has deposited or is required to deposit with an escrowholder or any

the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby could reasonably be expected to result in the release or

perform in a consistent and correct manner without interruption regardless of
the date on which such functions, calculations and processes are actually
performed and regardless of the date input to the applicable computer system
(whether before, on or after January 1, 2000); (ii) such computer, program or
software accepts, calculates, compares, sorts, extracts, sequences and otherwise
processes date inputs and date values, and returns and displays date values, in
a consistent and correct manner regardless of the dates used (whether before, on

responds to year input in a manner that resolves any ambiguities as to century
in a defined, predetermined and appropriate manner; (iv) such computer, program
or software stores and displays date information in ways that are unambiguous as
to the determination of the century; and (v) such computer, program or software
determines leap years in accordance with the following standard: (A) if dividing
the year by 4 yields an integer, it is a leap year, except for years ending in
00, but (B) a year ending in 00 is a leap year if dividing it by 400 yields an
integer.</LI>
