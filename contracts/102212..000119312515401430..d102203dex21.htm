Stock Plans"), and (ii) any other stock-based amounts awarded or that are
otherwise outstanding on the date of this Agreement (collectively with the Fox

13 ARTICLE III

 

 _CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES_

 

3.1. _Merger Consideration; Effect on Shares_.

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Univest, Fox Chase or the holders of any of the shares of Fox Chase
Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following
terms:

(a) Each share of Univest Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 

(b) All shares of Fox Chase Common Stock held in the treasury of Fox Chase
("Treasury Stock") and each share of Fox Chase Common Stock owned by Univest
immediately prior to the Effective Time (if any) (other than shares held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or in connection with debts previously
contracted) ("Univest Owned Shares") shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as promptly as
practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in
consideration therefor.

 

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Person, each share of Fox Chase Common Stock (excluding Treasury Stock and
Univest Owned Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted at the election of the holder thereof (in
accordance with the election and allocation procedures set forth in Section
3.2) into either the right to receive (i) $21.00 in cash without interest (the
"Cash Consideration") or (ii) .9731 shares of Univest Common Stock (the
"Common Stock Consideration," such amount of Common Stock Consideration
referred to herein as the "Exchange Ratio"). The Cash Consideration and the
Common Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as
the "Merger Consideration."

(d) After the Effective Time, shares of Fox Chase Common Stock shall be no
longer outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall represent thereafter by operation of this Section only the
right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in this Article.

 

(e) In the event Univest changes the number of shares of Univest Common Stock
issued and outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, non-cash
extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction and the record date
therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted. In addition, in the event Univest enters into an
agreement pursuant to which shares of Univest Common Stock would be
converted into shares or other securities or obligations of another
corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each
holder of Fox Chase Common Stock entitled to receive shares of Univest Common
Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to receive such number of shares or
other securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred
immediately prior to the happening of such event.

 



14 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Univest Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Univest Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Univest. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Univest shall pay to each former holder of Fox Chase Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Univest Common
Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the closing sales price of
a share of Univest Common Stock reported on Nasdaq on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any
fractional share interest, all shares of Fox Chase Common Stock owned by a
Fox Chase shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number
of whole shares of Univest Common Stock issuable to such Fox Chase
shareholder.

 

3.2. _Procedures for Exchange of Fox Chase Common Stock_.

 

(a) Exchange Procedures.

(i) Five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, Univest shall (A) deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Fox Chase Common Stock, an amount of cash necessary to make
payments of cash in accordance with this Section 3.2 to be paid as part of
the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with a
record date occurring on or after the Effective Time with respect thereto
without any interest on any such cash, dividends or distributions and cash
for fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(f)) and (B) provide the Exchange
Agent with the irrevocable authorization to issue sufficient shares of Univest
Common Stock ("New Certificates") (such cash and certificates for shares of
Univest Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event
within five (5) business days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of a Certificate that has not previously submitted
an Election Form, transmittal materials (the "Letter of Transmittal") for use
in exchanging their Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash. The Letter
of Transmittal will contain instructions with respect to the surrender of the
Certificates and the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor.
Upon the shareholders delivery to the Exchange Agent of Certificates
owned by such shareholder representing shares of Fox Chase Common Stock (or
an indemnity affidavit and related bond reasonably satisfactory to Univest and
the Exchange Agent, if such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed), and
the duly completed Letter of Transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall cause
evidence of uncertificated shares in the book entry form (in the form of the
written notice required by Section 1528(f) of the PCBL) or, at the option of
Univest, New Certificates into which such shares of Fox Chase Common Stock
are converted at the Effective Time to be delivered to such shareholder and/or
any check in respect of

 



15  cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration (and in respect of any
fractional share interests, dividends or distributions that such shareholder
shall be entitled to receive). No interest will be paid on any such cash to
be paid in lieu of fractional share interests or in respect of dividends or
distributions that any such shareholder shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to this Article III.

 

(iii) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Univest Common Stock
with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the record holder of any unsurrendered Certificate representing shares of Fox
Chase Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of
such Univest Common Stock until the holder thereof receives New Certificates
in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.2(a). After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section
3.2(a), the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Univest Common Stock,
and which such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of the
Certificates.

 

(b) _Exchange of Certificates_. Each holder of a Certificate or Certificates
(excluding Fox Chase and Univest ) will have the following options in
connection with the exchange of their Fox Chase Common Stock in connection
with the Merger:

(i) at the option of the holder, all of such holders Fox Chase Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the
Common Stock Consideration (such election, the "All Stock Election"); provided
that fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.1(f); or

(ii) at the option of the holder, all of such holders Fox Chase Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the Cash
Consideration (such election, the "All Cash Election"); or

 

(iii) at the option of the holder, such holders aggregate number of shares of
Fox Chase Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted
into and become any combination of the Common Stock Consideration and the Cash
Consideration (such election, the "Mixed Election"); or

 

(iv) if no Election is made by the holder by the Election Deadline, all of
such holders shares of Fox Chase Common Stock shall be deemed to be "Non-
Election Shares" and shall be convertible at the discretion of Univest into
either the Common Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a
combination thereof, subject to the allocation and proration provisions in
Sections 3.2(f) and (g).

(c) _Procedures for Election_. An election form and other appropriate
transmittal materials in such form as Fox Chase and Univest shall mutually
agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed to holders of a Certificate or
Certificates concurrent with or immediately after the mailing of the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus. The "Election Deadline" shall be 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the business day prior to the date of the Fox Chase
Shareholders Meeting or, if the Closing Date is more than five (5) business
days following the Fox Chase Shareholders Meeting, five (5) business days
preceding the Closing Date, after which an Election may not be made.

 



16 (d) _Perfection of the Election_. An Election shall be considered to have been
validly made by a holder of a Certificate or Certificates only if the
Exchange Agent shall have received an Election Form properly completed and
executed by such shareholder prior to the Election Deadline. Holders of record
of shares of Fox Chase Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees,
trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit
multiple Election Forms, provided that such Representative certifies that each
such Election Form covers all the shares of Fox Chase Common Stock held by
that Representative for a particular beneficial owner.

(e) _Revocation of Election_. Any holder of a Certificate or Certificates may
at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke such holders Election and
submit a new Election Form in accordance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b)
by providing written notice that is received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Election Deadline.

(f) _Limitations on Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement, sixty percent (60%) of the total number
of shares of Fox Chase Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
(excluding shares of Fox Chase Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in
Section 3.1(b)) (the "Anticipated Stock Conversion Number") shall be converted
into the Common Stock Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of
Fox Chase Common Stock (excluding shares of Fox Chase Common Stock to be
canceled as provided in Section 3.1(b)) shall be converted into the Cash
Consideration.

(g) _Allocation and Proration_. To the extent necessary to satisfy the
limitations in Section 3.2(f), within three (3) business days after the
Election Deadline, Univest shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation among holders of Fox Chase Common Stock of rights to receive the
Cash Consideration and the Common Stock Consideration as follows:

(i) If the number of shares of Fox Chase Common Stock (excluding shares of
Fox Chase Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 3.1(b)) with
respect to which holders of Fox Chase Common Stock have elected to receive the
Common Stock Consideration (the "Stock Election Number") exceeds the
Anticipated Stock Conversion Number, then all shares with respect to which
holders have made the Cash Election ("Cash Election Shares") and all Non-
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to
receive (A) the number of shares of Univest Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such
holder by (2) the Exchange Ratio by (3) a fraction the numerator of which is
the Anticipated Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
Stock Election Number (the "Stock Proration Factor") and (B) cash in an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock
Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by (z) one
minus the Stock Proration Factor; 

(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Anticipated Stock
Conversion Number (the amount by which the Anticipated Stock Conversion
Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
"Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration and the Non-Election
Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) the Exchange Ratio by (z) a fraction the numerator of

all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the

record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without any interest
thereon, any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after

record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason

Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal,

withholding were made by Univest or the Exchange Agent.

(n) _No Liability_. None of Univest, Fox Chase any of their respective
Affiliates or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of

them. Neither Fox Chase nor any Fox Chase Subsidiary is in default in any
material respect under any lease for any real or personal property to which
either Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary is a party, and there has not
occurred any event that, with lapse of time or the giving of notice or both,
would constitute such default, except for such defaults that, either
individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Fox Chase.

(b) With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which Fox Chase or
any Fox Chase Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell, if any, Fox Chase or such Fox Chase Subsidiary, as the case may be,
has a Lien or security interest (which, to the Knowledge of Fox Chase, is a
valid, perfected first Lien) in the securities or other collateral securing
the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds
the amount of the debt secured thereby. Fox Chase and each of the Fox Chase
Subsidiaries employs investment, securities risk management and other
policies, practices and procedures that Fox Chase and each such Fox Chase
Subsidiary believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of such
businesses.

 

(c) Fox Chase and each Fox Chase Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by Fox Chase to be reasonable for their respective operations in
accordance with industry practice. Neither Fox Chase nor any Fox Chase
Subsidiary, except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.9(c), has
received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will
be canceled or that, during the past five (5) years, coverage thereunder will
be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs (other than with respect to
health or disability insurance) with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. Except as set forth on Fox Chase Disclosure
Schedule 4.9(c), there are presently no material claims pending

 



27  under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by Fox Chase
or any Fox Chase Subsidiary under such policies (other than with respect to
health or disability insurance). All such insurance is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect, and within the last three years Fox Chase and
each Fox Chase Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for
which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies. Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.9(c) identifies all material
policies of insurance maintained by Fox Chase and each Fox Chase Subsidiary.

 

4.10. _Legal Proceedings_.

 

Except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.10, neither Fox Chase
nor any Fox Chase Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or,
to Fox Chases Knowledge, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or
other proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations or inquiries of any material nature (a) against
Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary, (b) to which Fox Chase or any Fox Chase
Subsidiarys material assets are or may be subject, (c) challenging the
validity or propriety of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (d) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
ability of Fox Chase or Fox Chase Bank to perform under this Agreement in any
material respect.

 

4.11. _Compliance With Applicable Law_.

 

(a) To the Knowledge of Fox Chase, each of Fox Chase and each Fox Chase
Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances,
rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets
and deposits, its business, and its conduct of business and its relationship
with its employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the
Bank Secrecy Act, OFAC regulations, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collections
Practices Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and all other applicable fair lending
laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices, and neither
Fox Chase nor any Fox Chase Subsidiary has received any written notice to the
contrary except where the failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fox
Chase. The board of directors of Fox Chase Bank has adopted, and Fox Chase
Bank has implemented, an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate
and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that has not
been deemed ineffective by any Governmental Entity and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Each of Fox Chase and each Fox Chase Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Fox Chase; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect in all material
respects,

 



28  and, to the Knowledge of Fox Chase, no suspension or cancellation of any
such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or will
result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to obtaining Regulatory Approvals.

(c) Since January 1, 2013, neither Fox Chase nor any Fox Chase Subsidiary has
received any written notification or, to the Knowledge of Fox Chase, any other
communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that Fox Chase or any Fox
Chase Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening
to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization that is
material to Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary; (iii) requiring, or
threatening to require, Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary, or indicating
that Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other
agreement with any Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator that is charged with
the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank
deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any
material respect the operations of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or
(iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or
limit, in any manner the operations of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any
such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this
sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Fox Chase Regulatory Agreement").
Neither Fox Chase nor any Fox Chase Subsidiary has consented to or entered
into any Fox Chase Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect or that
was in effect since January 1, 2013. The most recent regulatory rating given
to Fox Chase Bank as to compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA")
is "Satisfactory" or better.

 

(d) Each of Fox Chase and Fox Chase Bank are "well capitalized" within the
meaning of the regulations of the FRB and the FDIC, respectively, and neither
Fox Chase nor Fox Chase Bank knows of any facts or circumstances that would
reflect adversely on the financial and managerial standards to be applied by
the FRB under the BHCA in determining whether to approve the Merger. 

4.12. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12 contains a true and complete list of
each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
and all other employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other
arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA (including any funding mechanism
therefor), including, without limitation, defined benefit, defined
contribution, employee stock ownership, supplemental executive retirement
plans, stock purchase plans, stock option plans, restricted stock plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, severance arrangements, employment agreements,
consulting agreements, settlement agreements, release agreements, loan
arrangements, change-in-control agreements, fringe benefit plans, bonus plans,
incentive plans, director deferred agreements, director retirement

policies and arrangements (including vacation) under which any current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of Fox Chase or any Fox
Chase Subsidiary has any present or future right to benefits or under which
Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary has any present or future liability. All
such plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements shall
be collectively referred to as the "Fox Chase Benefit Plans."

 



29 (b) With respect to each Fox Chase Benefit Plan, Fox Chase has made available
to Univest a current, accurate and complete copy thereof (or a written
summary of the material terms of any unwritten plan) and, to the extent
applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument; (ii)

three plan years with respect to each Fox Chase Benefit Plan which is required
to file such annual return/report.

 

(c) (i) Except as would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Material Adverse Effect, each Fox Chase Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA
and the Code has been established and administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, as
applicable; (ii) each Fox Chase Benefit Plan which is intended to be
qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter as to its qualification, and with respect to
all plan document qualification requirements for which the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has closed, any
amendments required by such determination letter were made as and when
required by such determination letter, and to the Knowledge of Fox Chase,
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification; (iii) to the
Knowledge of Fox Chase, no event has occurred and no condition exists that is
reasonably likely to subject Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary, solely by
reason of its affiliation with any past or present "ERISA Affiliate" (defined
as any organization which is a member of a controlled group of organizations
within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code), to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA or the Code; (iv)
neither Fox Chase nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with
respect to a Fox Chase Benefit Plan (including the ESOP) has engaged in a non-
exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Code Section 4975
or ERISA Section 406 and the consummation of the Transaction will not give
rise to any such prohibited transaction; (v) except as set forth in Fox Chase
Disclosure Schedule 4.12, no Fox Chase Benefit Plan provides, and Fox Chase
and the Fox Chase Subsidiaries have no obligation to provide, any welfare
benefits to any employee or service provider (or any beneficiary thereof)
after the employees termination of employment and/or the service providers
termination of service other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code
and/or other applicable law; and (vi) all contributions required to be made
under the terms of any Fox Chase Benefit Plan have been timely made or, if not
yet due, have been properly reflected in Fox Chases financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.

(d) Except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12, Fox Chase and
the Fox Chase Subsidiaries do not maintain, and have not maintained within the
last ten years, a defined benefit plan. None of the Fox Chase Benefit Plans is
a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) and none
of Fox Chase, the Fox Chase Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any
liability with respect to a multiemployer plan that remains unsatisfied.

 



30 (e) Except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12, with respect to
any Fox Chase Benefit Plan, the assets of any trust under such Fox Chase
Benefit Plan, Fox Chase Benefit Plan sponsor, Fox Chase Benefit Plan fiduciary
or Fox Chase Benefit Plan administrator, (i) no actions, suits or claims
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending
or, to the Knowledge of Fox Chase, threatened and (ii) to the Knowledge of Fox
Chase, no facts or circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such actions, suits or claims.

(f) Except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not, separately or
together with any other event, (i) entitle any employee, officer or director
of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of, or increase the amount of, compensation due to any such employee,
officer or director, or (iii) result in a payment or amount that would not be
deductible by reason of Code Section 280G or would be subject to an excise
tax under Code Section 4999\.

(g) Except as would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Material Adverse Effect, all Fox Chase Benefit Plans which provide for the
deferral of compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, have
been administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Except as set forth in Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12, no outstanding
stock options and no shares of restricted stock and no other equity-based
awards are subject to Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Fox Chase
Disclosure Schedule 4.12 sets forth the amounts of any deferred compensation
payable to any employee or director of Fox Chase.

(h) Fox Chase has not communicated to any current or former employee thereof
any intention or commitment to modify in any material respect any Fox Chase
Benefit Plan or contract to establish or implement any other employee or
retiree benefit or compensation plan or arrangement.

(i) The ESOP is now and has been at all times since its inception, in form, an
"employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of Code Section 4975(e)(7)
and Section 407(d)(6) of ERISA, which, in form, qualifies under Code Section
401(a). The ESOP trust is now and has at all times since inception been
qualified under Section 501(a) of the Code. The shares of Fox Chase Common
Stock held by the ESOP trust constitute "employer securities," as defined in
Code Section 409(l), and "qualifying employer securities," as defined in
Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. Other than the ESOP Loan, there is no existing
indebtedness of the ESOP trust, Fox Chase, or any Fox Chase Subsidiary
relating to the ESOP trust or the ESOP. Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.12(i)
sets forth any documents that provide for indemnification of the fiduciaries
of the ESOP in connection with any prior transactions involving the ESOP or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule
4.12(i) contains a list of all participants in the ESOP (including active
employees, former employees, beneficiaries of deceased participants and
alternate payees), and the number of shares of Fox Chase Common Stock
allocated to each participants accounts under the ESOP as of December
31, 2014.

in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,

Exchange Act) of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Univest Common Stock.

 



38 5.3. _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Univest has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Regulatory Approvals, approval of
Nasdaq and the approval of this Agreement by Univests shareholders, to

validly approved by the board of directors of Univest, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Univest, except for the approval of Univests
shareholders, are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Univest and, subject to the receipt of the
Regulatory Approvals and approval by the required vote of Univests
shareholders and due and valid execution and delivery of this Agreement by Fox
Chase, constitutes the valid and binding obligations of Univest, enforceable
against Univest in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors
rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity.

 

(b) Subject to receipt of Regulatory Approvals, approval by the required vote
of Univests shareholders and Fox Chases and Univests compliance with any
conditions contained therein, (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Univest, (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) compliance by Univest with any of the terms or provisions hereof will
not (A) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of Univest or any similar governing documents of
any Univest Subsidiary, including Univest Bank or the Univest Shareholder
Rights Agreement, (B) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to Univest or any

default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of, accelerate the

or the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Univest or
any Univest Subsidiary under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which any of them is a party, or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,
except, with respect to (B) and (C), for any violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.4. _Consents_.

Except for the Regulatory Approvals, approval of the shareholders of Fox
Chase and Univest, and consents, approvals, filings and registrations from or
with the SEC, Nasdaq and state "blue sky" authorities, and compliance with any
conditions contained therein, no consents or approvals or waivers of, or
filings or registrations with, any Governmental Entity are or will be
necessary, and no consents or approvals of any third parties are or will be
necessary, in connection with (a) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Univest and (b) the completion by

 



39  Univest of the transactions contemplated hereby. Univest (x) has no reason
to believe that the consents and approvals set forth above will not be
received or will be received with conditions, limitations or restrictions
unacceptable to it or which would adversely impact the ability of Univest or
Univest Bank to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(y) knows of no reason why all Regulatory Approvals from any Governmental
Entity required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not be obtained on a timely basis.

 

5.5. _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Univest has previously made available, or will make available, to Fox
Chase the Univest Regulatory Reports. The Univest Regulatory Reports have
been, or will be, prepared in all material respects in accordance with
applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices, including, but not
limited to, all applicable rules, regulations and pronouncements of applicable
Bank Regulators, throughout the periods covered by such statements, and
fairly present or will fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position, results of operations and changes in shareholders equity of Univest
as of and for the periods ended on the dates thereof, in accordance with
applicable regulatory accounting principles, including, but not limited to,
all applicable rules, regulations and pronouncements of applicable Bank
Regulators, applied on a consistent basis.

 

(b) Univest has previously made available, or will make available, to Fox
Chase the Univest Financial Statements. The Univest Financial Statements have
been, or will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (including the related
notes where applicable) fairly present, or will fairly present, in each case
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of Univest and the Univest Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods ending on the dates
thereof (subject in the case of the unaudited interim statements to normal
year-end adjustments), in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved,
except as indicated in the notes thereto and except in the case of any
unaudited statements to normal recurring audit adjustments.

 

(c) At the date of each balance sheet included in the Univest Financial
Statements, neither Univest nor Univest Bank has had or will have
any material liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies of any nature
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type required to be
reflected in such Univest Financial Statements or Univest Regulatory Reports
or in the footnotes thereto that are not fully reflected or reserved against
therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto and except in the case of any
unaudited statements to normal, recurring audit adjustments and, in the case
of Univest Regulatory Reports, the absence of footnotes, except for such
liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies that, either alone or when
combined with all similar liabilities, have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Univest. 

(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Univest and the
Univest Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary or accountants (including all means
of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of

 



40  internal accounting controls described below in this Section 5.5(d). Univest
(i) has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to Univest, including its consolidated Univest
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Univest by others within those entities, and (iii)
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to Univests outside auditors and the audit committee of Univests board of
directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Univests ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Univests internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures (if any) were made in writing by management to Univests auditors
and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Fox
Chase.

(e) Since December 31, 2014, (i) neither Univest nor any Univest
Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of Univest, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary has
received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Univest or any Univest Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Univest or any Univest Subsidiary has engaged in illegal accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Univest or any Univest
Subsidiary, whether or not employed by Univest or any Univest Subsidiary, has
reported evidence of a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Univest or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of Univest or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Univest.

5.6. _No Material Adverse Effect_.

 

Univest has not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2014,
and no event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date that, in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Univest.

5.7. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage_.

(a) Univest and each Univest Subsidiary has good and, as to real property and
securities, marketable title to all material assets and properties owned, and
as to securities held, by Univest or any Univest Subsidiary in the conduct of
their businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal,
tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the
balance sheets contained in the Univest Regulatory Reports and in the Univest
Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that
such assets and properties have been disposed of for fair value in
the ordinary course of business since the date of such balance sheets),
subject to no material Liens, except (i) those items which secure liabilities
for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or
other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction
by a Univest Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary

 



41  capacity, (ii) statutory Liens for amounts not yet delinquent or that are
being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary Liens affecting
real property which do not adversely affect the value or use of such real
property, and (iv) those described and reflected in the Univest Financial
Statements. Such securities are valued on the books of Univest and each of the
Univest Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. Univest and the Univest
Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of
real and personal properties used by Univest and Univest Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. Neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary
is in default in any material respect under any lease for any real or personal
property to which either Univest or any Univest Subsidiary is a party, and
there has not occurred any event that, with lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute such default, except for such defaults that,
either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Univest.

(b) With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which Univest or any
Univest Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell, if any, Univest or such Univest Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a
Lien or security interest (which, to the Knowledge of Univest is a valid,
perfected first Lien) in the securities or other collateral securing
the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds
the amount of the debt secured thereby. Univest and each of the Univest
Subsidiaries employs investment, securities risk management and other
policies, practices and procedures that Univest and each such Univest
Subsidiary believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of such
businesses.

(c) Univest and each Univest Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by Univest to be reasonable for their respective operations in
accordance with industry practice. Neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary,
except as set forth in Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.7(c), has received
notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or
that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs
(other than with respect to health or disability insurance) with respect to
such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. There are
presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance and no
notices have been given by Univest or any Univest Subsidiary under
such policies (other than with respect to health or disability insurance).
All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and
within the last three years Univest and each Univest Subsidiary has received
each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during such
periods has not been denied indemnification for any material claims submitted
under any of its insurance policies. Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.7(c)
identifies all material policies of insurance maintained by Univest and each
Univest Subsidiary.

5.8. _Legal Proceedings_.

 

Except as set forth in Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.8, neither Univest nor
any Univest Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Univest, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental
investigations or inquiries of any material nature (a) against Univest or any
Univest Subsidiary, (b) to which Univest or any Univest Subsidiarys material
assets are or may be subject, (c) challenging the validity or propriety of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (d) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Univest or Univest
Bank to perform under this Agreement in any material respect.

 



42 5.9. _Compliance With Applicable Law_.

 

(a) To the Knowledge of Univest, each of Univest and each Univest Subsidiary
is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state,
local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
orders or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with its
employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Emergency
Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended, the Bank Secrecy Act, OFAC
regulations, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the Truth
in Lending Act, and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws
relating to discriminatory business practices, and neither Univest nor any
Univest Subsidiary has received any written notice to the contrary except
where the failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Univest. The board
of directors of Univest Bank has adopted and Univest Bank has implemented an
anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that has not been deemed ineffective
by any Governmental Entity and that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and
326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Each of Univest and each Univest Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Univest; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect in all material
respects, and, to the Knowledge of Univest, no suspension or cancellation of
any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or
will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals.

 

(c) Since January 1, 2013, neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary has
received any written notification or, to the Knowledge of Univest, any other
communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that Univest or any
Univest Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization that is material to Univest or any Univest Subsidiary; (iii)
requiring or threatening to require Univest or any Univest Subsidiary, or
indicating that Univest or any Univest Subsidiary may be required, to enter
into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any
other agreement with any Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator that is charged
with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of
bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in
any material respect the operations of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or
(iv) except as disclosed in Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.9(c), directing,
restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any
manner the operations of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary, including without
limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice,
communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as a "Univest 

 



43  Regulatory Agreement"). Neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary has
consented to or entered into any Univest Regulatory Agreement that is
currently in effect or that was in effect since January 1, 2013. The most
recent regulatory rating given to Univest Bank as to compliance with the CRA
is satisfactory or better.

(d) Each of Univest and Univest Bank are "well capitalized" within the
meaning of the regulations of the FRB and the FDIC, respectively, and neither
Univest nor Univest Bank knows of any facts or circumstances that would
reflect adversely on the financial and managerial standards to be applied by
the FRB under the BHCA in determining whether to approve the Merger.

5.10.  _Environmental Matters_.

Except as may be set forth in Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.10, to the
Knowledge of Univest, with respect to Univest and each Univest Subsidiary:

(a) Neither (i) the conduct nor operation of the business of Univest or any
Univest Subsidiary nor (ii) any condition of any property currently or
previously owned or operated by Univest or any Univest Subsidiary (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), results or resulted in
a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon Univest
or any Univest Subsidiary. No condition exists or has existed or event has
occurred with respect to any such property that, with notice or the passage
of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to
Univest or any Univest Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither
Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary during the past five years has received
any written notice from any Person or Governmental Entity that Univest or any
Univest Subsidiary or the operation or condition of any property ever owned,
operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them
(including any Other Real Estate Owned or property pledged as collateral for
any loan held by Univest or any Univest Subsidiary) are currently in violation
of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or
relating to Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited
to, responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon Univest or any Univest Subsidiary; and

(b) There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Univests
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, Governmental Entity or other forum
against Univest or any Univest Subsidiary (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law
or (ii) relating to the presence of or release into the environment of any
Materials of Environmental Concern (as defined herein), whether or not
occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by Univest or any Univest
Subsidiary.

5.11. _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_.

Neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor in connection with the

 



44  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or
commitment for any fees or commissions to any such person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for the retention of
Griffin Financial Group, LLC ("Griffin") and the fee payable pursuant thereto.

5.12.  _Loan Matters_.

(a) The allowance for loan losses reflected in Univests audited consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2014 was, and the allowance for loan losses
shown on Univests balance sheets for periods ending after December 31, 2014
was, or will be, adequate, as of the date thereof, under GAAP.

 

(b) All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest entered on
the books of Univest and the Univest Subsidiaries arose out of bona fide
arms-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the ordinary course of Univests or the appropriate Univest Subsidiarys
respective business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness
with respect to such loans (including discounts) are true and genuine and are
what they purport to be. All such loans are owned by Univest or the
appropriate Univest Subsidiary free and clear of any Liens.

 

(c) The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans
described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and
other collateral documents or security instruments relating thereto are, in
all material respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be.

 

5.13. _Related Party Transactions_.

 

Except as set forth in Univest Disclosure Schedule 5.13 and except for any
intracompany transactions, neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary is a
party to any transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation)
with any Affiliate of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary. All such transactions
(a) were made in the ordinary course of business, (b) were made
on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as
those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other Persons,
and (c) did not involve substantially more than the normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features. No loan or credit
accommodation to any Affiliate of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary is
presently in default or, during the three year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified or
extended, except for rate modifications pursuant to Univests loan
modification policy that are applicable to all Persons. Neither Univest nor
any Univest Subsidiary has been notified that principal and interest
with respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid
when due or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit
accommodation by Univest is inappropriate.

 

5.14. _No Fox Chase Capital Stock_.

 

Neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, any shares of Fox Chase Common Stock, or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire any Fox Chase Common Stock, except pursuant to the
Merger as contemplated in this Agreement.

 



45 5.15. _SEC Reports_.

 

Univest has timely filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
by reference) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since
January 1, 2013 (the "Univest SEC Reports"). As of their respective filing
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), each
of the Univest SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, applicable to such Univest SEC Reports.
None of the Univest SEC Reports, including any financial statements, schedules
or exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they
were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the
date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of Univest Subsidiaries is required to file
or furnish any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. As of the date
of this Agreement, no executive officer of Univest has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

5.16. _Required Vote_.

 

Provided that a quorum is present, in person or by proxy, the affirmative vote
of at least a majority of the votes cast of Univest Common Stock at the
Univest Shareholders Meeting by the holders of shares of Univest Common Stock
is required to approve this Agreement and the Merger under Univests articles
of incorporation and applicable law.

 

5.17. _Registration Obligations_.

 

Except for the shares of Univest Common Stock to be issued under Article III
of this Agreement, neither Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary is under any
obligation, contingent or otherwise, that will survive the Effective Time by
reason of any agreement to register any transaction involving any of its
securities under the Securities Act.

 

5.18. _Risk Management Instruments_.

 

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for Univests own account, or for the account of one or more of
the Univest Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects
entered into in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies, and, to the Knowledge of Univest, with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time; and, to the Knowledge of
Univest, each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of Univest or any Univest Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by
general equity principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither Univest
nor any Univest Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of Univest any other party
thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or
arrangement in any material respect.

 



46 5.19. _Fairness Opinion_.

 

The board of directors of Univest has received a written opinion from Griffin
to the effect that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set
forth therein, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair to
Univest from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or

closed, any amendments required by such determination letter were made as and
when required by such determination letter, and, to the Knowledge of Univest,
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification; (iii) to the
Knowledge of Univest, no event has occurred and no condition exists that is

required to be filed for any Univest Benefit Plan within the past twelve (12)
months.

material respect, infringe upon, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate
any intellectual property owned or controlled by any third party.

Proposal; (iv) release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to
enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Fox

or letter of intent with respect to any Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal or

agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to a Fox Chase
Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by Fox
Chase or any Fox Chase Representative, whether or not such Fox Chase
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Fox Chase
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Fox Chase or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Fox Chase. Fox Chase and
each Fox Chase Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of the Fox Chase
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing or potential Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal" shall mean
any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Univest ), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Fox Chase Acquisition Transaction.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Fox Chase Acquisition Transaction" shall
mean (A) any transaction or series of transactions involving any merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary; (B) any
transaction pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would
acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly, any assets of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary representing,
in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of Fox
Chase and each Fox Chase Subsidiary on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance,
sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities)
representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the votes attached to the
outstanding securities of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary; (D) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third
party or group beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any
class of equity securities of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary; or (E)
any transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.8(a), Fox Chase may take any of the
actions described in clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 6.8(a) if but only if,
(i) Fox Chase has received a bona fide unsolicited written Fox Chase
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.8; (ii) the Fox Chase board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that such Fox Chase Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
(as defined below); (iii) Fox Chase has provided Univest with at least one (1)
business days prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to
furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to Fox
Chase or any of the Fox Chase Subsidiaries or otherwise

 



56  relating to a Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal, Univest receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Univest
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Fox Chase shall
promptly provide to Univest any non-public information regarding Fox Chase or
any Fox Chase Subsidiary provided to any other Person that was not previously
provided to Univest, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other party.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into a Fox Chase Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Fox Chase board of directors determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice
of outside legal counsel and financial advisor: (i) would, if consummated,
result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and
outstanding shares of Fox Chase Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of
the assets of Fox Chase and the Fox Chase Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that involves consideration to the
holders of the shares of Fox Chase Common Stock that is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to Fox Chases
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered and the absence of a financing
condition; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal.

(c) Fox Chase shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Univest in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Representatives,
in each case in connection with any Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal, and such
notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-
mails or other electronic communications) unless (i) such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of such materials
jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege, or (iii) disclosure of such
materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree.
Fox Chase agrees that it shall keep Univest informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such
proposal, offer or request).

 

(d) Subject to Section 6.8(e), neither the Fox Chase board of directors nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Univest in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the
Fox Chase Recommendation, or make any statement, filing or release,
in connection with the Fox Chase Shareholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the Fox Chase Recommendation (it being understood that
taking a neutral position or no position with respect to a Fox Chase
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the Fox
Chase Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
(or cause Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary to enter into) any letter of
intent, agreement in principle,

 



57  acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Fox Chase
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.8(b)) or (B) requiring Fox
Chase to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.8(d) above, prior to the date of Fox Chase
Shareholders Meeting, the Fox Chase board of directors may approve or
recommend to the shareholders of Fox Chase a Superior Proposal and withdraw,
qualify or modify the Fox Chase Recommendation in connection therewith or take
any of the other actions otherwise prohibited by Section 6.8(d) (a "Fox Chase
Subsequent Determination") after the third (3rd) business day following the
receipt by Univest of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal") from Fox
Chase advising Univest that the Fox Chase board of directors has decided that
a bona fide unsolicited written Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.8) constitutes a
Superior Proposal (it being understood that Fox Chase shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any materially revised
Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that Fox Chase
proposes to accept and the subsequent notice period shall be three (3)
business days) if, but only if, (i) the Fox Chase board of directors has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to Fox Chases shareholders under applicable law and (ii) at the end of
such three (3) business day period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been committed to in writing
by Univest since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal (provided,
however, that Univest shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement), the Fox Chase board of directors has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.8(e) and (B) that such Fox
Chase Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Fox Chase from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, to
the extent applicable, or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if,
in each case, the board of directors is advised by outside counsel to Fox
Chase that the failure to make such disclosure to Fox Chases shareholders
would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under Maryland law.

6.9. _Proxy Solicitor_.

 

If Univest requests, Fox Chase shall retain a proxy solicitor in connection
with the solicitation of Fox Chase shareholder approval of this Agreement.
The selection of the Proxy Solicitor shall be at the discretion of Fox Chase,
provided it is reasonably acceptable to Univest.

 

6.10. _Fox Chase Dividends_.

 

From the date hereof until the Effective Time, Fox Chase shall consult with
Univest regarding the record dates and the payment dates relating to any
dividends in respect of Fox Chase Common Stock, it being the intention of Fox
Chase and Univest that holders of Fox Chase Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter
with respect to their shares of Fox Chase Common Stock and/or any Univest
Common Stock that any such holder receives in exchange therefor pursuant to
the Merger.

regular and ordinary course of business (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain

7.4. _Disclosure Supplements_.

 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Univest will promptly
supplement or amend the Univest Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising that, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Univest Disclosure Schedule or that is
necessary to correct any information in such Univest Disclosure Schedule that
has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to
such Univest Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties_.

 

Univest shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



60 7.6. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Univest agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that such
efforts do not significantly decrease the benefits of the transaction to
Univest.

7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_.

 

In the event that Univest determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify Fox Chase.

7.8. _Post-Closing Governance_.

 

On or prior to the Effective Time, Univest shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause Tomas M. Petro, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Fox Chase, and two (2) other individuals serving on Fox Chases board of
directors, and selected by Univest in its sole discretion, to be appointed to
the board of directors of Univest as of the Effective Date. One such person
shall serve as a director in the class of directors whose term expires in
2017, one such person shall serve as a director in the class of directors
whose term expires in 2018 and the other such person shall serve as a director
in the class of directors whose term expires in 2019. At the conclusion of
such terms, such directors shall be re-nominated and recommended for re-
election to serve as a member of Univests Board of Directors for at least
one additional three-year term, subject to the satisfaction of Univests board
then-existing renomination policies and criteria applicable to incumbent
directors.

 

7.9. _Proxy Solicitor_.

 

If Fox Chase requests, Univest shall retain a proxy solicitor in connection
with the solicitation of Univest shareholder approval of this Agreement. The
selection of the proxy solicitor shall be at the discretion of Univest,
provided it is reasonably acceptable to Fox Chase.

 

7.10. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Commencing at the Effective Time, Univest shall, and shall cause each of
the Univest Subsidiaries to, provide the employees of Fox Chase and the Fox
Chase Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time
with (i) base compensation that is, in the aggregate, no less favorable than
the base compensation provided by Fox Chase and the Fox Chase Subsidiaries
on the date of this Agreement and (ii) employee benefits that are provided to
similarly situated employees of Univest and the Univest Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 7.10(h) hereof with respect to the ESOP,
after the Closing Date, the Fox Chase Benefit Plans may, at Univests
election and subject to the requirements of the Code and ERISA, continue to be
maintained separately, consolidated, merged, frozen or terminated; provided,
however, that after the Closing Date, Univest shall amend the Fox Chase
401(k) plan to freeze participation and contributions under such plan
contemporaneously

 



61  with the participation of all eligible Fox Chase employees in the applicable
Univest 401(k) plan. Following such action, Univest will continue to maintain
the individual participant accounts under the Fox Chase 401(k) plan until
such time as the Fox Chase 401(k) plan assets are merged with and into the
applicable Univest 401(k) plan in accordance with the requirements of Code
Section 414(1). In all events, Fox Chase 401(k) plan participants who, as of
the date of its consolidation, merger, freeze or termination, whichever occurs
first, had outstanding plan loans shall be permitted to repay those loans in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 

(c) Employees of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary who become participants
in a Univest Benefit Plan shall, except with respect to any Univest defined
benefit pension plan, be given credit for service as an employee of Fox Chase
or Fox Chase Bank or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in such plans,
vesting purposes under such plans and benefit levels (but not benefit
accrual) under such plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees of Fox
Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary shall not be eligible to participate in any
Univest defined benefit pension plan within the meaning of ERISA Section
3(2).

(d) This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Univest or
Univest Bank to terminate the employment of any employee or to review
employee benefits programs from time to time and to make such changes
(including terminating any benefit plan or program) as it deems appropriate.

 

(e) In the event of any termination or consolidation of any Fox Chase health
plan with any Univest health plan, Univest shall make available to employees
of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary and their dependents health coverage
on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Univest employees. Unless an
employee of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary affirmatively
terminates coverage under a Fox Chase health plan prior to the time that such
employee becomes eligible to participate in the Univest health plan, no
coverage of any of the employees of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary or
their dependents shall terminate under any of the Fox Chase health plans
prior to the time such employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees
of Univest and their dependents. In the event of a termination or
consolidation of any Fox Chase health plan, terminated Fox Chase and Fox Chase
Subsidiary employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continuation coverage under group health plans of Univest in accordance with
COBRA and/or other applicable law and the Fox Chase Employee Severance
Compensation Plan, dated January 1, 2012, as set forth on Fox Chase Disclosure
Schedule 7.10(e) (the "Fox Chase Employee Severance Compensation Plan"). With
respect to any employee of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary, any
coverage limitation under the Univest health plan due to any pre-existing
condition shall be waived by the Univest health plan to the degree that such
condition was covered by the Fox Chase health plan and such condition would
otherwise have been covered by the Univest health plan in the absence of such
coverage limitation.

 

(f) In the event Univest terminates the employment (other than for
circumstances reasonably constituting cause) of any employees of Fox Chase or
Fox Chase Bank (other than employees of Fox Chase or Fox Chase Bank who are
subject to employment contracts), Univest shall pay severance benefits to such
employees as follows: (A) in the event employment is terminated on or prior to
the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, in

 



62  accordance with the Fox Chase Employee Severance Compensation Plan; (B) in
the event employment is terminated thereafter, in accordance with the then
existing severance policy of Univest or its successor; or (C) as otherwise
agreed between Fox Chase and Univest.

(g) Univest agrees to honor, or cause one of the Univest Subsidiaries to
honor, in accordance with their terms, all employment and change of control
agreements listed on Fox Chase Disclosure Schedule 4.8(a), subject to any
limitations imposed under applicable law or by any Regulatory
Authority; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent Univest or
any of the Univest Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such
agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable law.

 

(h) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Univest shall cause to
be filed all necessary documents with the IRS to request a favorable
determination letter that the ESOP is, upon its termination, qualified under
the provisions of Sections 401(a), 409, and 4975(e)(7) of the Code. As soon as
practicable after the receipt of a final favorable determination letter
from the IRS, the account balances in the ESOP, including any surplus in the
suspense account after full repayment of the outstanding ESOP loan and all of
the ESOPs administrative expenses that are payable from the ESOP trust shall
be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in accordance with the
provisions of the Code and applicable law and the terms of the ESOP.

(i) Univest shall establish a retention bonus pool equal to twenty percent
(20%) of the aggregate base salary for employees jointly designated in writing
by Univest and Fox Chase (other than employees of Fox Chase who are subject to
employment contracts or other contracts providing for severance or other
payments upon termination of employment or upon change in control of Fox
Chase) in order to help retain key employees. Such bonuses shall be payable
after the Effective Date on a date jointly determined by Univest and Fox
Chase in the event that the designated employee remains employed by Univest or
Univest Bank, as the case may be, until the Effective Date or a date
thereafter jointly determined by Univest and Fox Chase; provided that the
employee satisfactorily fulfills the duties of such employees position
through such date. With the prior consent of Univest, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Fox Chase shall establish
the amount of the retention bonus for each such employee.

(j) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer,
employee, other service provider or independent contractor or any other person
shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Fox Chase or Univest Benefit
Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 

7.11. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Univest shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been
at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time,
an officer, director or employee of Fox Chase or Fox Chase Bank or any Fox
Chase Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or
judgments and amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall
require the prior written consent of Univest, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in connection

 



63  with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party
is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of Fox Chase or a Fox Chase Subsidiary if such
Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or
before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent as would have been permitted by Fox Chase under the MGCL and under Fox
Chases articles of incorporation and bylaws. Univest shall pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent as would have been permitted by Fox
Chase under the PBCL and under Fox Chases articles of incorporation and
bylaws, upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such
Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this subsection upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify Univest (but the failure so to notify Univest shall not relieve
it from any liability that it may have under this subsection, except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices Univest ) and shall deliver to
Univest the undertaking referred to in the previous sentence.

 

(b) In the event that either Univest or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Univest shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 7.11. Univest shall pay all reasonable costs, including
attorneys fees, as incurred and in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this Section 7.11 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law;
provided, however, such payment of costs shall be immediately reimbursed to
Univest by such Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party is not successful
enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this Section
7.11. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to
any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under applicable law.

(c) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 7.11 are
subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(k)) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the FDIC (12 C.F.R. Part 359).

(d) Univest shall maintain, or shall cause Univest Bank to maintain, in effect
for six years following the Effective Time, the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies covering the officers and directors of
Fox Chase (provided, that Univest may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially
less favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Univest be required to expend
pursuant to this subsection more than 250% of the annual cost currently
expended by Fox Chase with respect to such insurance (the "Maximum Amount");
provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premium necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount,
Univest shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the

 



64  Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, Fox Chase agrees in order
for Univest to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers
liability insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary representations as such
insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

 

(e) The obligations of Univest provided under this Section 7.11 are intended
to be enforceable against Univest directly by the Indemnified Parties and
shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of
Univest.

7.12. _Merger Consideration Availability_.

Univest agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of Univest Common Stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or
borrowing capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.13. _Exchange Listing_.

 

Univest shall list, prior to the Effective Time, on Nasdaq the shares of
Univest Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger, and Univest shall give all notices and make all filings with Nasdaq
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

 

7.14. _Rule 16b-3_.

 

Univest shall take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to cause the
transactions contemplated by Article III and any other dispositions of equity
securities of Fox Chase (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of
equity securities of Univest in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

and the Univest Shareholders Meeting, Univest shall draft and prepare, and
Fox Chase shall cooperate in the preparation of, the Registration Statement,
including a combined proxy statement and prospectus satisfying all applicable
requirements of applicable state securities and banking laws, and of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed to the Fox Chase
shareholders and the Univest shareholders, together with any and all
amendments or supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy
Statement-Prospectus"). Univest shall, as soon as is practicable (provided
that Fox Chase has timely provided all information requested in writing by
Univest or its counsel, within forty-five (45) days after the date hereof),
file the Registration Statement with the SEC under the Securities Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of

Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and each of Fox Chase and Univest shall
thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the Fox Chase
shareholders and the Univest shareholders. Univest shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by

Chase promptly of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the

supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Fox
Chase promptly copies of all correspondence between Univest or any of its
representatives and the SEC. Univest shall give Fox Chase and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to
its being filed with the SEC and shall give Fox Chase and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and supplements to the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all responses to requests for additional

reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other party hereto, to respond
promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required amendments and supplements thereto
to be mailed to the holders of Fox Chase Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Fox Chase Shareholders Meeting and to the holders of the Univest Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Univest Shareholders Meeting at the earliest
practicable time. Univest will advise Fox Chase promptly after Univest
receives notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed of the issuance of any
stop order or the suspension of the qualifications of shares of Univest Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the Registration Statement, or the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose.

 



66 (c) Fox Chase and Univest shall promptly notify the other party if at any time
it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration
Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. In such event, Fox Chase shall cooperate with

shall file an amended Registration Statement with the SEC, and Fox Chase shall
mail an amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the Fox Chase shareholders and
Univest shall mail an amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the Univest
shareholders.

and beneficiaries of the ESOP to direct the ESOP trustee as to the voting of
shares held in their respective accounts under the ESOP in accordance with the
terms of the ESOP documents and applicable law, and the ESOP trustee shall
vote the unallocated shares held under the ESOP, and the allocated shares for
which no direction is received, in accordance with the terms of the ESOP.

8.3. _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

Each of Fox Chase and Univest will cooperate with the other and use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare all
necessary documentation, to effect all necessary filings and to obtain all
necessary permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of the SEC,
the Bank Regulators and any other third parties or Governmental Entities,
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
Univest will make all necessary filings in respect of the required Regulatory
Approvals as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (provided that Fox
Chase has timely provided all information requested in writing by Univest or
its counsel, within forty-five (45) days after the date hereof). Fox Chase and
Univest will furnish each other and each others counsel with all information
concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, petition or any other statement or
application made by or on behalf of Fox Chase or Univest to any Bank Regulator
or Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the Bank Merger, and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Fox Chase shall have
the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to Fox Chase and any Fox Chase Subsidiary which appear
in any filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any Governmental Entity. Univest shall give Fox Chase and its
counsel the opportunity to review and comment on each filing prior to its
being filed with a Bank Regulator and shall give Fox Chase and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on all regulatory filings, amendments and
supplements to such filings and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent
to, a Bank Regulator. Univest shall notify Fox Chase promptly of the receipt
of any comments of any Bank Regulator with respect to such filings.

 



67 8.4. _Current Information_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each party will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of the other party and report the general status of its
ongoing operations at such times as the other party may reasonably request.
Each party will promptly notify the other party of any material change in the
normal course of its business or in the operation of the properties of such
party or the Univest Subsidiaries or the Fox Chase Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving such party or any Univest Subsidiary
or Fox Chase Subsidiary, as applicable. Without limiting the foregoing,
senior officers of Univest and Fox Chase shall confer at the reasonable
request of the other, and shall meet on a reasonably regular basis, to review
the financial and operational affairs of Fox Chase and the Fox Chase
Subsidiaries, in accordance with applicable law, and Fox Chase shall give due
consideration to Univests input on such matters, with the understanding that,
notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither
Univest nor any Univest Subsidiary shall, under any circumstance, be
permitted to exercise control of Fox Chase or any Fox Chase Subsidiary prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that neither Univest nor Fox Chase
shall be required to take any action that would provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, in such disclosing partys
reasonable judgment, violate or prejudice the rights, business interests, or
confidences of any customer or other person or would result in the waiver
by such disclosing party of the privilege protecting communications between
such disclosing party and any of its legal counsel.

(b) Fox Chase Bank shall provide Univest Bank, within a reasonable period of
time after the end of each calendar month, a written list of Nonperforming
Assets, its asset quality report and a written list of its investment security
purchases during the calendar month then ended. On a monthly basis, Fox Chase
shall provide Univest Bank with a schedule of all commercial loan approvals,
which schedule shall indicate the loan amount, loan type and other material
features of the loan. To the extent requested by Univest, Fox Chase and Fox
Chase Bank shall each provide Univest copies of minutes of meetings of the
board of directors and the committees thereof.

 

(c) Each of Univest and Fox Chase shall promptly inform the other upon
receiving notice of any legal, administrative, arbitration or
other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or investigations (by any
federal, state or local commission, agency or board) relating to the alleged
liability of such party or any Fox Chase Subsidiary or Univest Subsidiary, as
applicable, under any labor or employment law.

(d) Univest and Fox Chase shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan
for the conversion of Fox Chases data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by Univest Bank, which planning shall
include, but not be limited to: discussion of the possible termination by Fox
Chase of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the Effective
Time or at a date thereafter; non-renewal of personal property leases and
software licenses used by Fox Chase in connection with its systems
operations; retention of outside consultants and additional employees to
assist with the conversion and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or
self-provided system services, it being understood that Fox Chase shall not
be obligated to take any such action prior to the Effective Time. If Fox Chase
takes, at the

 



68  request of Univest Bank, any action relative to third parties to facilitate
the conversion that results in the imposition of any termination fees or
charges, Univest Bank shall pay any such fees and charges directly to such
third parties, and shall indemnify Fox Chase for the costs of reversing the
conversion process, if for any reason the Merger is not consummated for any
reason other than a breach of this Agreement by Fox Chase.

 

8.5. _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 11.1 hereof, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws, each of Fox Chase and Univest, for the purposes of verifying
the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger
and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the
other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall
cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally
(including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party), and,
during such period, each of Fox Chase and Univest shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access. Neither Fox Chase nor Univest nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Fox Chases or Univests, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Univest and Fox Chase shall hold in
confidence all confidential information of the other on the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with Section
11.1. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be
completed, each of Univest and Fox Chase will continue to comply with the
terms of such Confidentiality Agreement.

8.6. _Fox Chase Officer Agreements_.

 

Fox Chase shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the employees
listed on Univest Disclosure Schedule 8.6 to execute as soon as practicable,
and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement,
non-solicitation agreements substantially in the form included in Univest
Disclosure Schedule 8.6 in consideration for the payments set forth on
Univest Disclosure Schedule 8.6 on the Closing Date.

 



69 8.7. _Litigation and Claims_.

 

Each of Univest and Fox Chase shall promptly notify each other in writing of
any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit,
subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending,
or to the Knowledge of Univest or Fox Chase, as applicable, threatened
against Univest, Fox Chase or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a)
questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated
hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Univest, Fox Chase
or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks
to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Fox Chase shall give Univest the opportunity to participate at its
own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against
Fox Chase and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed
without Univests prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

8.8. _No Control of Other Party s Business_.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Univest, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Fox Chase or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Fox Chase, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Univest or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Univest and Fox Chase
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.

and all waiting periods relating to such approvals, authorizations or consents
shall have expired; and no such approval, authorization or consent shall
include any condition or requirement, excluding standard conditions that are
normally imposed by the regulatory authorities in bank merger transactions,
that would, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the board of directors of
either Fox Chase or Univest, materially and adversely affect the business,

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Univest.

provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this

Chase) or Section 9.3(b) (in the case of a breach of covenant or agreement by
Univest );

transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a special meeting of Fox Chase
shareholders called for that purpose; or (ii) the shareholders of Univest fail

majority vote of its members, at any time during the five (5) business day
period commencing with the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

Univest Market Value multiplied by .80; and

 

(ii) (A) the quotient obtained by dividing the Univest Determination Date

Ratio to an amount which, when multiplied by the Univest Determination Date
Market Value equals the lesser of (x) $20.16 or (y) the product of the Index
Ratio and the Initial Univest Market Value multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
If within such five (5) business day period, Univest delivers written notice
to Fox Chase that it intends to proceed by paying the Additional
Consideration, as contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no termination
shall occur pursuant to this Section 10.1(i) and this Agreement shall remain

connection therewith or with respect to the enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Univest or Fox Chase
pursuant to Section 10.1(e) following failure of the shareholders of Fox
Chase to approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, prior to
the Fox Chase Shareholders Meeting, any Person shall have publicly announced
a Fox Chase Acquisition Proposal, Fox Chase shall pay to Univest the Univest
Expense Reimbursement Fee within five (5) business days after Univest makes
written demand therefor. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of

the amount due pursuant to this Section 10.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Univest commences a suit which results in a judgment against Fox
Chase for the Univest Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Fox Chase shall
pay the costs and expenses of Univest (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Fox Chase fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.2, then Fox Chase shall
pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the
date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on
the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per
annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ )
in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid. The amounts payable by Fox Chase pursuant to Sections
10.2(b)(iii) and 10.2(b)(iv) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty,
and, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the sole
monetary remedy of Univest in the event of a termination of this Agreement
specified in such Sections.
