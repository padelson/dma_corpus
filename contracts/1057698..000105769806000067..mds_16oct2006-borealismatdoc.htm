Affiliate may require certain consents or approvals (including,  in  certain
cases, consent or approval to enter into this Agreement,  and, in  certain
cases, such consents or approvals may be unreasonably or  arbitrarily

parties and where applicable, trigger the third party  rights  with respect
to such Regional Assets (and the associated Assumed  Liabilities), the
Parties shall take commercially reasonable efforts  to  comply with the

between the Parties, acting reasonably) of a purchase  and  sale agreement
with respect to one or more of the Regional Assets  on terms  mutually
agreed to between Buyer and MDS, acting reasonably (each  a  " **Regional 
Purchase Agreement** ").

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

Buyer  agrees that the transfer of the Purchased Assets, the Replacement 
Contracts and the Migrating Assets shall be on an "as is, where is basis" 
and none of Sellers makes or will make any representation or warranty  and 
there are no conditions, including as to title, merchantability,  fitness 
for purpose, value or condition, except as expressly set forth herein  and 
in the Regional Purchase  Agreements.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**2.2** **Excluded  Assets**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |

         |  

(b)

    |  

Notwithstanding  anything else herein contained, but subject to Subsection
2.2(c),  (A) should Sellers be unable to obtain any required third party 
consent or approval (or waiver thereto) to the transfer of a Regional  Asset
to Buyer (or, as applicable, any Designated Buyer Affiliate)  on or  before
the Closing Time (a " **Consent  Exclusion** "),  (B) should any third party
exercise its right to acquire and acquires  a  Regional Asset, or **** (C) 
should the period in which the right of any third party to exercise  a 
right to acquire a Regional Asset not have expired on or before the  Closing
Time and such right has not prior to that time been waived  by all 
applicable Persons (a " **ROFR  Exclusion** ")  (any event referred to in
(A), (B) or (C) being an " **Excluded  Asset Event** "),  the following
shall and shall be deemed to occur automatically and  without  any further
act or formality and this Agreement shall be deemed to  be  amended
accordingly in respect of an Excluded Asset Event: (i) the  Regional Assets,
the Books and Records and the Assumed Liabilities  relating thereto shall not
be transferred to or assumed by Buyer  or any  Designated Buyer Affiliate,
as applicable, on the Closing Date and  shall  be excluded from the
definition of Diagnostics Business, MDS Diagnostics  Division, Purchased

Disclosure Letter and applicable Schedules thereto  and  elsewhere in the
Agreement where the context so requires, (ii) such  Regional Assets shall be
an Excluded Asset, (iii) the amount of each  of  the Purchase Price and the
Closing Cash Amount shall be reduced by,  in the  event of an Excluded Asset
Event under (B) or (C) above, the last  price  offered within the range, or,
in the event of a Consent Exclusion,  the  highest value in the range for
the amount of the Purchase Price allocated  to each such Excluded Asset under
Section 3.8, and, in each case,  the  definition of Purchase Price and
Closing Cash Amount shall be amended  accordingly, (iv) the Closing Balance

without regard to such Excluded  Assets  and Assumed Liabilities related
thereto; and (v) neither Buyer (nor  any  Designated Buyer Affiliate) nor
any of the Sellers shall have any  further  obligation or Liability under
this Agreement or the applicable Regional  Purchase Agreement with respect to
such Regional Asset and Assumed  Liabilities relating thereto. The
representations and warranties  of MDS  provided in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been given as  of the  date of this Agreement and as required
in respect of the Closing  Date only  with respect to the Diagnostics
Business, MDS Diagnostics Division,  the  Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities as such terms may be  amended  in accordance with this
Subsection.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

Notwithstanding  Subsection 2.2(b),  if following the Closing Time, in
respect of a Consent Exclusion,  the  required third party consent or
approval (or waiver thereto) to the  transfer of the applicable Regional
Asset to Buyer is obtained or  waived  or, in respect of a ROFR Exclusion,
the rights of all applicable  third  parties to acquire the applicable
Regional Asset are waived, no longer  apply or expire without having been
exercised, Subsection 2.2(b)  shall no longer apply in respect of such
Regional Asset, such Regional  Asset shall no longer be an Excluded Asset and
Buyer shall, as soon  as  practicable, purchase such Regional Asset on the
terms and conditions  hereof applicable to such Regional  Asset.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**2.3** **Non-Assignable  Contracts**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Neither  this Agreement nor any Closing Document shall constitute an
assignment  or  an attempted assignment of any Non-Assignable Contract. MDS
agrees  to  assign and to cause each other Seller to assign any Non-
Assignable  Contracts to Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate
when  such  assignment is permitted and as Buyer or the applicable
Designated  Buyer  Affiliate may from time to time direct. MDS shall, and
shall cause  each  other Seller to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all  consents required for the assignment to Buyer or the applicable
Designated  Buyer Affiliate of the Contracts, the Equipment Leases, the
Warranty  Rights and Transferable Licences included in the Purchased Assets 
of such  Seller. No Seller shall, however, be obliged to commence
arbitration  or  any other legal proceeding or make any payments to third
parties  other  than any administrative, processing or similar fee or any
other amounts  contemplated by the particular Contract, Equipment Lease,
Warranty  Rights  or Transferable Licence to be payable in connection with
the assignment  thereof to the Buyer pursuant hereto. Buyer and each
Designated Buyer  Affiliate shall co-operate with and assist each Seller in
such Seller's  efforts to obtain such consents.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

In  respect of Non-Assignable Contracts other than Leases, to the extent 
permitted by Applicable Law and the provisions of such Non-Assignable 
Contract: (i) if any of the Non-Assignable Contracts are not assignable  by 
the terms thereof or consents to the assignment thereof have not  been 
obtained prior to the Closing Time, such Non-Assignable Contracts  shall be 
held by the applicable Seller (without any additional expense to  the 
Seller whatsoever) in trust for Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer 
Affiliate and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed  by
Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate in the name  of the 
applicable Seller and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder  shall
be for the account of Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer  Affiliate
(without any additional expense to Sellers whatsoever);  and (ii)  MDS shall
take, and shall cause the applicable Seller (if other than  MDS)  to take or
cause to be taken such reasonable action in the Seller's name  or otherwise
as Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  may  reasonably
require so as to provide Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer Affiliate
with the benefits thereof and each Seller shall promptly  pay over or deliver
to Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  all money or other
consideration, if any, received by such Seller  in  respect of all such Non-
Assignable Contracts. Upon the Closing, MDS  shall  and shall cause each
other Seller to authorize Buyer or the applicable  Designated Buyer
Affiliate, to the extent permitted by Applicable  Law and  the terms of such
Non-Assignable Contracts, at the expense of Buyer  or the  applicable
Designated Buyer Affiliate, to perform all of such Seller's  obligations
arising under such applicable Non-Assignable Contracts  after  the Closing
Time. MDS shall continue to use and cause the Sellers  to  continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver  all  remaining
consents required for the assignment to Buyer or the applicable  Designated
Buyer Affiliate of the remaining Non-Assignable Contracts  after  the
Closing Time. If a Non-Assignable Contract is not validly assigned  to 
Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate within twelve  (12) 
months after the Closing Date, such Non-Assignable Contract shall  be 
deemed to be an Excluded Asset and all obligations of Sellers to  Buyer or 
the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate and all obligations hereunder  of 
Buyer and the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate to Sellers with  respect
to such Non-Assignable Contract shall  terminate.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

In  respect of those Non-Assignable Contracts which are Leases included  in
the  Purchased Assets (the " **Non-Assigned  Leases** "),  the following
provisions shall  apply:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(i)

    |  

if  the landlord's consent to the assignment of the Non-Assigned Lease has
not  been obtained prior to the Closing Time, the applicable Lease shall 
remain  in the name of MDS or the applicable Seller, and such party shall 
continue  to pay the rents and otherwise observe and perform the covenants 
and  obligations of the tenant under the provisions of the applicable  Non-
Assigned Lease (including without limitation, maintenance and  repair 
obligations and insurance  requirements);

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(ii)

    |  

on  the Closing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the
provisions  of such Non-Assigned Lease, the applicable Seller and the Buyer
or  the  applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate shall enter into a
sublease,  licence  or other occupancy agreement relating to such premises
on terms and  conditions mutually acceptable to the Parties, acting
reasonably,  pending  the delivery of the landlord's consent to the
assignment of the applicable  Non-Assigned Lease, and the applicable Seller
shall take or cause  to be  taken such reasonable action in its name or
otherwise as Buyer or  the  applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate shall
reasonably require so  as to  provide Buyer or the applicable Designated
Buyer Affiliate with,  and/or  not deprive, Buyer or the applicable
Designated Buyer Affiliate of,  the  benefit of quiet and uninterrupted use
and possession of the applicable  premises for its conduct of the
Diagnostics  Business;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(iii)

    |  

on  the Closing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the
provisions  of such Non-Assigned Lease, the Buyer or the applicable
Designated  Buyer  Affiliate shall access and occupy the applicable premises
under such  sublease, licence or other form of occupancy agreement, shall
comply  with  the obligations of the occupant of the applicable premises
under  the  provisions of the applicable Non-Assigned Lease (including
without  limitation, repair of any damage to the premises caused by the
Buyer  or  the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate, and insurance for
its  own  operations) and shall, provided access and occupancy is obtained 
and  during the period that the Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer 
Affiliate enjoys and/or is not deprived of the benefit of quiet and 
uninterrupted use and possession of the applicable Leased Premises  (other 
than as a result of force majeure or a default by the Buyer or Designated 
Buyer Affiliate under the applicable sublease, licence or other form  of 
occupancy agreement or the applicable landlord under the Non-Assigned  Lease)
for the conduct of the Diagnostics Business from such premise,  promptly
reimburse the applicable Seller for or, at the written direction  of such
Seller pay directly to the landlord, the rents (including  any  applicable
Taxes) and all other amounts payable by the tenant under  the  Non-Assigned
Lease, including utility costs, realty Taxes and common  area  charges, in
respect of the applicable premises accruing from and  after the  Closing
Time, but for greater certainty shall not be responsible  for the  payment
of any amount due by the tenant prior to the Closing Time,  or in  respect
of obtaining the consent, or the consequences of the failure  to  obtain the
consent of the landlord to the assignment of the Non-Assigned  Lease;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(iv)

    |  

MDS  shall, or shall cause the applicable Seller (if other than MDS),  as
may be  the case, to and Buyer shall, continue to use commercially
reasonable  efforts to obtain and deliver the applicable landlord's consent
to the  assignment to the Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer
Affiliate  of  the applicable Non-Assigned Lease, and in the event that such
consent  is  not obtained and delivered within eighteen (18) months after
the  Closing  Date, then, at the option of the Buyer or the applicable
Designated  Buyer  Affiliate, the foregoing interim occupancy arrangement
shall come  to an  end on the last day of the eighteenth (18th)  month
following the Closing Date, the Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer
Affiliate shall remove all of the Purchased Assets from the  applicable
premises, the applicable Non-Assigned Lease shall be deemed  to  be an
Excluded Asset, and all obligations of the Buyer or the applicable 
Designated Buyer Affiliate with respect to such Non-Assigned Lease  shall 
terminate; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(v)

    |  

Buyer  shall have reasonable access to all MDS personnel, information and 
data as  may be reasonably required or requested by Buyer in connection
with  the  obligations of MDS to obtain and deliver the applicable
landlord's consent  to the assignment of the applicable Non-Assigned Lease to
the Buyer  or the  applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate. From and after
this date,  MDS shall  keep Buyer apprised of its activities concerning its
obtaining and  delivering such applicable landlord consents including,
without limitation  providing the Buyer with monthly reports identifying
which additional  consents have been obtained, whether there were any changes
in the  status  of discussions with the landlords, and identifying the
parties contacted  and the statements made in connection with all outstanding
consents.  MDS  shall consult with and provide Buyer with all reasonable
opportunities  to  assist MDS in such activities and agrees to consider, in
good faith,  all  Buyer input and requests provided in the course of the
aforementioned  activities of MDS in respect of such applicable landlord
consents  and not  to unreasonably refuse to take into account and/or
implement any  reasonable Buyer requests or input  received.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**2.4** **Place  of Closing**

 

 

The  Closing shall take place at the Closing Time at the offices of Fasken
Martineau  DuMoulin LLP, Toronto, Ontario, or at such other place as may be
agreed upon  by  the Parties.

 

 

**2.5** **Closing  Time**

 

 

Notwithstanding  any provision herein to the contrary, the transactions
comprising the Closing  shall be effective in the sequence contemplated in
Schedule 2.5.

 

 

**ARTICLE 3**

 

 

**CONSIDERATION  FOR PURCHASED ASSETS**

 

 

**3.1** **Purchase  Price** **;  Holdback Amount**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Subject  to Section 2.2  and to the adjustments set forth in Sections
3.1(a)(iv),  3.4,  3.5  and 3.6  and Schedule 3.1,  the purchase price
(the " **Purchase  Price** ")  payable to MDS or as MDS directs for all of
the Purchased Assets,  the  Replacement Contracts and the Migrating Assets
is $801,000,000. The  cash  amount payable on Closing (the " **Closing 
Cash Amount** ")  is equal to the Purchase Price less (i) the amount of the
Estimated  Long-Term Liabilities; (ii) a contribution of capital of
$7,000,000  being  the amount of cash, which together with the Target
Working Capital  will  permit Buyer immediately after the Closing Time to
carry on the  Diagnostics Business in the ordinary course of business; (iii)
the  Holdback Amount; and (iv) the aggregate amount of the net proceeds 
received by MDS or any Operators from the sale of any assets Primarily 
related to the Diagnostics Business since April 30, 2006 to the extent  that,
in respect of any sale completed, such net proceeds are not  less  than
$100,000 and have been distributed to MDS or the partners of  MDS ONT  LP,
as applicable. Buyer acknowledges that the Purchase Price does  not  include
any amount payable by Buyer as contemplated under Subsection  3.10(c).  MDS
shall provide a statement of the Estimated Long-Term Liabilities  to  the
Buyer three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. MDS acknowledges  that
the Purchase Price is inclusive of the purchase price consideration  payable
by Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate to  MDS under  a
Regional Purchase Agreement. Consequently, appropriate adjustments  shall 
be made to the Closing Cash Amount to reflect the actual purchase  price 
paid under all Regional Purchase  Agreements.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

The  Parties covenant and agree that the Holdback Amount shall be
calculated  under, governed by the principles set forth in, and released
and  paid to  MDS subject to the terms and conditions prescribed by,
Schedule  3.1.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**3.2** **Post-Closing  Audit**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Forthwith  following the Closing Time, MDS shall cause its auditor, Ernst and
Young  LLP, to conduct an audit of the MDS Diagnostics Division in order 
to  prepare the Closing Balance Sheet. Based on the Closing Balance Sheet, 
MDS  shall prepare the unaudited Closing Regional Balance Sheet and the 
calculation of the Working Capital of the MDS Diagnostics Division  in 
Ontario and Quebec and the head office of the MDS Diagnostics Division  as 
at the Closing Time. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Regional  Balance
Sheet and such calculation of Working Capital shall be prepared  on  a
combined basis in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent  with
the Financial Statements. Buyer shall co-operate with MDS and  Ernst  and
Young LLP and shall provide to such Persons copies of all financial  and
other records and access to all necessary personnel required  to  conduct
the audit and prepare the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing  Regional
Balance Sheet and calculation of Working Capital. At the  request  of MDS,
Buyer shall provide assistance in the preparation of the  Closing  Balance
Sheet, the Closing Regional Balance Sheet and the calculation  of  Working
Capital.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

MDS  shall co-operate with Buyer in conducting such audit and will provide 
to  Buyer and its auditor copies of all working papers prepared by MDS 
for  review. Representatives of Buyer or Buyer's auditor are permitted to
be  present at, and to participate in, any inventory counts and any other 
procedures used in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Regional 
Balance Sheet and calculation of Working Capital. A copy of the Closing 
Balance Sheet, Closing Regional Balance Sheet and Working Capital 
calculation shall be delivered to each Party within seventy-five  (75) days 
of the Closing Date.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

If  Buyer objects to any of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Regional 
Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital, then Buyer  shall 
prepare and deliver to MDS a statement (an " **Objection  Notice** ") 
setting forth the matters that are the subject of Buyer's objection and 
Buyer's position including reasonable details of calculations on or before 
the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery of such statements and 
calculation. The Parties shall then use reasonable efforts to resolve  such 
objection for a period of twenty (20) days following the delivery  of the 
Objection Notice. If the matter is not resolved by the end of such  twenty 
(20) day period, then the matters remaining in dispute will be referred  to 
the CEO of each Party to attempt to resolve within ten (10) days  after the 
date of referral. If the matter is not resolved within such ten (10)  day 
period, then the items remaining in dispute shall be submitted by  the 
Parties to arbitration in accordance with Article 9.  If Buyer fails to
deliver an Objection Notice within the thirty (30)  day  period, it shall be
deemed to have agreed to the Closing Balance  Sheet,  the Closing Regional
Balance Sheet and Working Capital calculation  which  shall then be final
and binding upon the  Parties.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(d)

    |  

The  " **Working  Capital Adjustment Date** "  shall be the date that is
three (3) Business Days after (i) the date  Buyer  agrees in writing or is
deemed under clause (c) above to agree to  the  Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Regional Balance Sheet and Working  Capital calculation, whichever is
earlier or (ii) if Buyer issues  an  Objection Notice in accordance with the
foregoing, the date the Parties  agree to the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Regional Balance  Sheet and  the calculation of Working Capital or
the date the Closing Balance  Sheet,  the Closing Regional Balance Sheet and
Working Capital calculation  are  finally determined by arbitration as
contemplated by this Section,  whichever is earlier.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**3.3** **Determination  of Value of Inventory, Accounts Receivable**

 

 

For  the  purposes of Section 3.4,  (a)  Inventory shall be valued at the
lower of actual cost or market value determined  in accordance with GAAP,
applied on a basis consistent with the Financial  Statements; and (b) the
value of the Accounts Receivable at the Closing Time  shall be the amount
included in the Closing Balance Sheet (and the Closing  Regional Balance
Sheet) less an amount equal to the balance of Accounts  Receivable owed by
Persons other than a Governmental Authority or hospital  that  are older
than 90 days and for which no provision has been made in the Closing  Balance
Sheet (and the Closing Regional Balance Sheet) and less the amount  of  any
Accounts Receivable excluded as an asset in the definition of Ontario Assets 
and Quebec Assets. For greater certainty, in determining Working Capital,
any  liability for Taxes arising from or in connection with the
implementation of  the  Buyer Purchase Structure shall be valued at zero.

 

 

**3.4** **Working  Capital Adjustment**

 

 

On  the  Working Capital Adjustment Date, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted in  accordance with Section 3.5  and as  follows:

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

the  amount of any decrease in Working Capital of the MDS Diagnostics 
Division  in Ontario and Quebec and the head office of the MDS Diagnostics 
Division  as at the Closing Time from the Target Working Capital shall be
deducted  from the Purchase Price and the amount of any increase in Working 
Capital  of the MDS Diagnostics Division in Ontario and Quebec and the head 
office  of the MDS Diagnostics Division as at the Closing Time from the
Target  Working Capital shall be added to the Purchase Price, each on a
dollar  for  dollar basis; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

the  Purchase Price shall be increased, on a dollar for dollar basis,  by
the  amount that the cash, marketable securities and other cash equivalents 
as  set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (and the Closing Regional 
Balance  Sheet) exceeds the Petty Cash included in the Working Capital of 
the MDS  Diagnostics Division in Ontario and Quebec and the head office of 
the MDS  Diagnostics Division,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

and  the  aggregate or net payment required under this Section 3.4  shall
be  made by the appropriate Party to the other Party on the Working Capital 
Adjustment Date.

 

 

**3.5** **General  Adjustments**

 

 

The  Parties shall make, without duplication, and provided that such

         |  

(a)

    |  

Subject  to and in compliance with Applicable Law, including the

Shared Contracts  as  relate to the Diagnostics Business, the Replacement
Contracts and  the  Migrating Assets, in each case, once acquired, and the
Books and  Records  over which it or an Operator exercises control on
condition that  no Person  given access interferes with the ordinary conduct
of the Diagnostics  Business by MDS or any Operator and MDS shall furnish to
Buyer such  operating data and other information with respect to the
Diagnostics  Business, the Purchased Assets, such portions of the Shared
Contracts  as  relate to the Diagnostics Business, to the extent related to
the  Diagnostics Business, the Replacement Contracts and the Migrating

time  reasonably request. MDS agrees that Buyer may conduct such
environmental  investigations and tests on the Real Property included in the
Purchased  Assets as Buyer, acting reasonably, considers necessary, at
Buyer's  expense and provided that no damage is caused to such Real
Property  and  the condition of the Real Property is restored substantially
to its  pre-investigation condition and that such investigations and tests 
do not  interfere with the ordinary conduct of the Diagnostics Business. 
Buyer  shall indemnify and hold harmless MDS and the Operators of and from 
and  against all actions, causes of actions, suits, claims, demands,
damages,  losses, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them to 
the  extent Buyer does not comply with the foregoing obligations with

forthwith  provide to MDS a copy of the results of such investigations and
tests  and  shall not disclose and shall cause any Person who prepared a
report  based  on such investigations and tests not to disclose, any
information  relating  to such investigations and tests or contained in any
such report  to any  Person unless compelled to do so by Applicable Law.
Except as set  forth in  this Agreement, the exercise of any rights of
access or inspection  by or  on behalf of Buyer under this Section 5.1.6 
will not affect or mitigate the covenants, representations and warranties  of
MDS in this Agreement which will continue in full force and effect  as 
provided in this Agreement.

         |  

(b)

    |  

Subject  to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.1.4, 
both prior to the Closing Date and, if the sale and purchase of the 
Purchased Assets hereunder fails to occur for whatever reason, thereafter 
Buyer will not disclose to anyone or use for its own or for any purpose 
other than the purpose contemplated by this Agreement any confidential 
information concerning MDS or an Operator or the Diagnostics Business 
obtained by Buyer pursuant hereto, will hold all such information  in the 
strictest confidence and, if the sale and purchase of the Purchased  Assets 
hereunder fails to occur for whatever reason, will return to MDS  or, at

prior notice to Buyer, to defend any claim or other proceeding as

Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and
in any  event within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement
(or within  such other period of time as the Parties may agree), on the
written election  of  Buyer, the Parties will prepare and file with the

    |  

a  short-form pre-merger notification (and if the Commissioner requests  a 
long-form, they shall file a long-form in addition to or in lieu  of a

**5.2.2** **Competition  Act Clearance Process**

 

 

Buyer  and  MDS shall promptly furnish to the Commissioner, or her
authorized representative  under the Competition Act, any additional

Buyer in consultation with the other. MDS and Buyer  will:

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

not  extend or consent to any extension of any waiting period under the 
Competition Act or enter into any agreement with the Commissioner,  or her

         |  

(c)

    |  

permit  the other to review in advance any proposed written communications 
of any  nature with the Commissioner, or her authorized representative
under  the  Competition Act, relating to such transactions, and provide the
other  with  final copies thereof, except to the extent of competitively
sensitive  information, which competitively sensitive information will be

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**5.2.3** **Filing  Fees**

 

 

The  responsibility for payment of the required filing fees and applicable
Taxes  thereon payable in connection with the Competition Act Clearance will

In  addition to its obligations in respect of Regulatory Consents under the 
Competition Act, Buyer shall, at its own expense, subject to obtaining the 
reasonable cooperation and assistance of MDS, use all commercially
reasonable  efforts to obtain by the Closing Time all other Regulatory
Consents in respect  of the Diagnostics Business in Ontario and Quebec. MDS
shall cause the Sellers  to reasonably co-operate with and assist Buyer
during the Interim Period in  order to permit Buyer to obtain such Regulatory
Consents. Subject to Applicable  Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Parties will coordinate and  co-operate with one another in exchanging such
information and supplying such  assistance as may be reasonably requested by
each in connection with the  foregoing including providing each other with
all notices and information  supplied or filed with any Governmental

**5.4** **Buyer 's  Covenants**

 

 

**5.4.1** **Employees**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Prior  to the Closing Time, but conditional upon the completion of the
Closing,  Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate shall offer
employment  to all the Ontario Employees and Quebec Employees on terms and
conditions  which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
upon  which  such Employees are employed by the relevant Seller at the
Closing  Time  including under the short-term incentive plan applicable to
each  such  Employee provided that it is agreed that such offer by Buyer
will  not  include any stock option or stock purchase plan entitlement.
Buyer  will  develop and implement a long-term performance based incentive
plan  or  other compensation scheme to be effective on or about January 1, 
2007, for  senior management of the Diagnostics Business in recognition
that  Buyer is  not able to offer a stock option or stock purchase plan.
Buyer neither  represents nor warrants that such long-term performance based
incentive  plan or other compensation scheme will be equivalent to any
stock  option  or stock purchase plan currently provided by MDS. In making
such  offer,  Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate shall take
into  account  the aggregate compensation and benefits (including, as
applicable,  the  short term incentive plan) enjoyed by the Ontario
Employees and Quebec  Employees and the existing seniority and length of
service of the  Ontario  Employees and Quebec Employees.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

Until  the Closing Time, each Seller shall be responsible for all wages, 
bonuses,  earned vacations, sick leave, termination and severance pay, and 
other  remuneration and benefits for all of their Employees. On and after 
the  Closing Time, Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  shall
be  responsible for all wages, bonuses, earned vacations, sick leave, 
termination and severance pay and other remuneration and benefits  under 
Buyer's Benefits Plans with respect to the Employees who accept Buyer's or 
the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate's offer of employment. For  greater
certainty, each Seller shall be responsible for all termination  and
severance costs related to the termination by such Seller of  any  Ontario
Employee or Quebec Employee who refuses the offer of employment  made in
accordance with Subsection 5.4.1(a).

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

If  Buyer, a Designated Buyer Affiliate or an Operator acquired by Buyer  or
a  Designated Buyer Affiliate terminates any Employee within six (6) 
months  of the Closing Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable
Designated  Buyer Affiliate or Operator to, provide such Employee with
termination  and  severance pay at least as favourable as that for which
such Employee  would  have been entitled to receive under the severance
policy or employment  contract applicable to such Employee immediately prior
to the Closing  Time  other than with respect to any entitlement under an
employee stock  option  plan or employee share purchase plan or any
retention, change of  control  or deal bonus pertaining to the sale of the
Diagnostics  Business.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**5.4.2** **Cooperation**

 

 

Buyer  shall co-operate with and assist Sellers during the Interim Period in
order  to  permit the Closing to be consummated. In particular, Buyer shall
provide to  the  applicable third party partners and shareholders in respect
of the Regional  Assets and the lessors and other third parties under the
Leases, Equipment  Leases and Contracts included in the Purchased Assets all
such information  relating to Buyer and the applicable Designated Buyer
Affiliate including  financial information, information relating to its
business experience and  the  business experience of the individuals who
ultimately control and operate Buyer  and the applicable Designated Buyer
Affiliate and with respect to their ability  to perform their obligations
under the applicable partnership agreement and  shareholders' agreement
relating to such Purchased Assets and such Leases,  Equipment Leases and
Contracts and operate the Diagnostics Business, as may  be  reasonably
required by such Persons in order to obtain the consents of such  Persons to
the transfer of such Purchased Assets to Buyer or the applicable  Designated
Buyer Affiliate.

 

 

**5.5** **Benefit  Plans**

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

As  soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but effective as of the 
Closing Time, Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  shall 
establish and register with the applicable Governmental Authorities,  or 
shall otherwise cause to be provided, one or more pension plans or  other 
retirement savings arrangements for those Ontario Employees and Quebec 
Employees who accepted the Buyer's or the Designated Buyer Affiliate's, as 
the case may be, offer of employment who participated in a Pension  Plan 
immediately prior to the Closing Time (the " **Buyer 's  Pension Plans**") 
each of which shall contain benefit provisions which are substantially 
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided under the Pension  Plan in 
which the Ontario Employees and Quebec Employees who accepted the  Buyer's 
or Designated Buyer Affiliate's, as the case may be, offer of employment, 
respectively, participated immediately prior to the Closing Time.  Buyer or 
the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate shall also establish or  otherwise
provide a pension fund or other funding arrangement for  each  Buyer's
Pension Plan. Buyer's Pension Plans shall provide that for the  purposes of
eligibility for membership, vesting and continued benefit  accrual, service
by Ontario Employees and Quebec Employees who accepted  the Buyer's or
Designated Buyer Affiliate's, as the case may be, offer of  employment
recognized under a Pension Plan shall be recognized as  continuous unbroken
service with Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer  Affiliate. Buyer or
the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate further  agrees to provide the
applicable Seller with such documentation and  information as it may
reasonably require to satisfy itself that the  Buyer's Pension Plans and the
pension funds therefor have been properly  established or otherwise provided,
as applicable, in accordance with  this  Section. For those Ontario
Employees and Quebec Employees who join  a  Buyer's Pension Plan that is a
"registered pension plan" as that term is  defined in subsection 248(1) of
the ITA, MDS shall cause the Pension  Plans  in which such employees
participated immediately prior to the Closing  Time  to recognize service of
such employees with Buyer or the applicable  Designated Buyer Affiliate after
the Closing Time for purposes of  vesting  and eligibility for benefits.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

At  the Closing Time, Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate 
shall  make available to the Ontario Employees and Quebec Employees who 
accepted  the Buyer's or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate's, as the
case  may be, offer of employment benefits, in addition to those provided 
under  the Buyer's Pension Plans, which are substantially comparable, in
the  aggregate to those provided under the Benefit Plans which currently 
are  applicable to such Employees (" **Buyer 's  Benefit Plans**").  For
the purposes of Buyer's Benefit Plans, Buyer or the applicable  Designated
Buyer Affiliate agrees to credit the Employees who accepted  the  Buyer's or
the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate's offer of employment  with
eligibility and vesting service on and after the Closing Time  for  such
Employees' service prior to the Closing Time recognized by the  applicable
Benefit Plans. Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer  Affiliate agrees to
waive any pre-existing medical condition or similar  restriction in any
Buyer's Benefit Plans only to the extent an Employee  has coverage on the
Closing Date under the Benefit Plans which currently  are applicable to such
Employee notwithstanding such pre-existing  medical  condition or similar
restriction. Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer  Affiliate will
credit amounts paid by such Employees during the 2006  plan  year as
deductibles or co-payments under the applicable Benefit Plan  toward the
total deductible and/or co-payment requirements under  the  applicable
Buyer's Benefit Plan after the Closing Time. With respect to  any flexible
benefit arrangements, Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer Affiliate
will provide credit under the applicable Buyer's Benefit  Plan after the
Closing Time for the net unused benefits remaining  including, for greater
certainty, the balance in the health spending  account of any such Employee.
MDS or the applicable Seller shall  remain  responsible for those
Liabilities under any Benefit Plan in connection  with claims incurred with
respect to Employees before the Closing  Time. No  Seller shall be
responsible for any Liabilities under any Benefit  Plan in  connection with
claims incurred at or after the Closing Time with  respect  to any Ontario
Employees or Quebec Employees who accepted the offer  of  employment of the
Buyer or applicable Designated Buyer  Affiliate.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

Effective  as of the Closing Time, each Employee who is a participant in
any  Benefit  Plan shall cease to be an active participant in such Benefit
Plan  and the  applicable Seller shall be responsible for any benefits
accrued by  or  payable to any Employee under such Benefit Plan up to the
Closing  Time.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(d)

    |  

Effective  as of the Closing Time, each Seller shall assign to Buyer or the 
applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate, and Buyer or the applicable 
Designated Buyer Affiliate shall assume all of Sellers' Liabilities and 
responsibilities with respect to death or medical benefits (whether  or not 
insured), with respect to Ontario Employees and Quebec Employees  who 
accepted the Buyer's or applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate's, as the  case
may be, offer of employment beyond retirement or other termination  of 
service.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(e)

    |  

For  greater certainty, effective as of the Closing Time, each Seller 
shall  cease to have any Liabilities or obligations in respect of those 
Benefit  Plans to which it did not contribute or was not required to
contribute  and  for which its obligations were limited to providing
administrative  services in respect thereto, provided that nothing in this
Subsection  5.5(e)  shall relieve any obligation of a Seller to provide
benefits after  the  Closing Time as provided by this Agreement to Ontario
Employees and  Quebec  Employees who do not accept Buyer's or the applicable
Designated Buyer  Affiliate's, as the case may be, offer of  employment.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**5.6** **Limited  Trade Mark Licence**

 

 

At  the  Closing Time and conditional upon Closing, MDS and Buyer and/or the
Designated  Buyer Affiliates shall execute and deliver a limited trade mark
licence  agreement (the " **Limited  Trade Mark Licence** ")  in the  form
of agreement attached as Schedule 5.6 hereto.

 

 

**5.7** **Migration  Agreement**

 

 

Contemporaneously  with the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, MDS
and Buyer and/or the  Designated Buyer Affiliates have executed and delivered
a migration agreement  (the " **Migration  Agreement** ")  in the  form of
agreement attached as Schedule 5.7(a) hereto. At the Closing Time and 
conditional upon Closing, MDS and Buyer and/or the Designated Buyer
Affiliates  shall execute and deliver a licence agreement in respect of the
CBS IP (the  " **CBS  License Agreement** ")  in the  form of agreement
attached as Schedule 5.7(b)  hereto.

 

 

**5.8** **Non-Competition  Agreement**

 

 

At  the  Closing Time and conditional upon Closing, MDS and Buyer and/or the
Designated  Buyer Affiliates shall execute and deliver a non-competition
and  non-solicitation agreement (the " **Non-Competition  Agreement** ") 
in the  form of agreement attached as Schedule 5.8 hereto.

 

 

**5.9** **Support  Services Agreement**

 

 

At  the  Closing Time and conditional upon Closing, MDS and Buyer and/or the
Designated  Buyer Affiliates shall execute and deliver a support services
agreement (the  " **Support  Services Agreement** "),  which  agreement
shall be consistent with the term sheet attached hereto at Schedule  5.9 
(the " **Support  Services Agreement Term Sheet** ")  and on  terms and
conditions mutually agreed to by the Parties.

 

 

**5.10** **Shared  Contracts**

 

 

Buyer  and  MDS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of
the Shared  Contracts to be split into two contracts, one with respect to the
rights  relating to the Diagnostics Business in Ontario and Quebec and, as
applicable  British Columbia, in favour of Buyer or the applicable Designated
Buyer  Affiliate and the other with respect to the rights not relating to
such  Diagnostics Business in favour of MDS. Each Shared Contract will only
be split  upon the mutual agreement of MDS, Buyer (or, as applicable, the
Designated  Buyer  Affiliate) and the applicable third party as to the terms
of each of the  contracts resulting from the split thereof. Subject to the
foregoing, the  Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) each of the Parties
(and in the case  of  Buyer, any Designated Buyer Affiliate, as applicable)
shall co-operate and  work  together with the other Party and the applicable
third party to achieve such  splitting; (ii) no Seller shall be obliged to
commence arbitration or any other  legal proceeding or make any payments to
third parties other than any  administrative, processing or similar fee in
connection with such splitting;  (iii) for any Shared Contract, the Parties
may not be able to obtain terms  and  conditions in each of the contracts
resulting from a split thereof that are  identical to or as favourable as the
terms and conditions of such Shared  Contract prior to the split; and (iv)

Shared Contract to effect any split  of  such Shared Contract until such
time as it is satisfied as to the terms and  conditions of such amendment or
new, extended, renewed or replacement contract,  if any, as the case may be.
Each reference in this Agreement relating to the  assignment or non-
assignment of Non-Assignable Contracts shall, as it pertains  to Shared
Contracts, be deemed to be a reference to the intended splitting  of  such
Shared Contracts as described in this Section.

Agreement so as to acquire certain of the Purchased Assets,  Replacement
Contracts and Migrating Assets as contemplated under Schedule 2.5.  Each
Designated Buyer Affiliate shall execute a contract of adhesion agreeing

(a)

    |

disbursements) will  be  borne by MDS or any of the other Sellers and Buyer
will be solely  responsible for any and all Taxes actually incurred by MDS in
connection  with or in any way related to the implementation of the Buyer
Purchase  Structure and any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation,  legal  fees and disbursements) actually incurred by MDS or the
Sellers in  the  event of the termination or unwinding of such steps of the
Buyer  Purchase  Structure should Closing not occur (unless Closing does not
occur  as a  result of the failure of MDS to satisfy any conditions
precedent  within  its control), and the Buyer shall indemnify and reimburse
MDS and  the  Sellers forthwith, on an as incurred basis, for any and all
such  Taxes,  costs and expenses;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

without  restricting the application of paragraph (a) above, MDS agrees to 
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in respect of any required or desired 
amendment to Schedule 2.5 following the date of this Agreement; provided, 
however, that (i) if MDS or any of the Operators incurs  incremental ****

for  liability to Tax to MDS or any of the Operators, and MDS or any of 
the  Operators incurs Taxes in connection with or in any way related to 
the  subject matter of such amendment, in both (i) and (ii) as determined

all  such Taxes. In the event of any such amendment, Buyer shall be
responsible  for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all
legal  fees  and disbursements) actually incurred by MDS or any of the
Operators  in  connection with or in any way related to implementation of
the subject  matter of any such amendment to Schedule 2.5. Buyer shall
indemnify  and  reimburse each of MDS and the Operators forthwith, on an as
incurred  basis, for any and all such Taxes, costs and expenses so
incurred;

any way related  to  implementation of the subject matter of any such
amendment to Schedule  2.5. MDS shall indemnify and reimburse each of Buyer

survive completion or termination of this Agreement and  the  transactions
contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force  and  effect for the
benefit of the other Party until 60 days after the  expiration of the period

**5.14** **Replacement** **Material** **Contracts**

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement, including Section 5.1.1,  in 
proceeding to seek any necessary consent to the assignment of any Contracts 
contemplated in Subsection 6.1.5(b),  if, in  MDS' reasonable estimation,
after having made commercially reasonable efforts to  do so (which efforts
shall not include commencing arbitration or any other  legal  proceeding),
the applicable third party to any particular Contract other than,  for the
avoidance of doubt, a Lease (a " **Subject  Contract** ")  will  not, on or
prior to the Closing Time, provide its consent to the assignment  of  the
Subject Contract to Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  or 
will not provide such consent without requiring MDS to pay any amount other 
than  an amount contemplated to be payable by MDS under Section 2.3,  then 
MDS may satisfy the condition in Subsection 6.1.5(b)  by  securing on or
prior to the Closing an equivalent substitute for such Subject  Contract and
assigning such equivalent substitute Contract to the Buyer or  the 
applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate on the Closing and the provisions of 
Subsection 2.3(b)  shall  not apply to such Subject Contract. Whether MDS
shall have secured, on or before  the BC Closing, an equivalent substitute
for a Subject Contract shall be (i)  determined by the President, Senior
Vice-President, Finance and, in respect  of a  Subject Contract pertaining
to information technology, by the Senior  Vice-President, Information
Technology of the management team of the MDS  Diagnostics Division, and (ii)
evidenced by the delivery to Buyer on or before  the BC Closing of an
officers' certificate executed by each of such Persons  certifying such
determination in their respective view. Each such Person shall  act
reasonably in his determination under this Section.

may  terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to the other Party and in
such  event:

 

 

         |  

(a)

unless  the other Party can show that the condition or conditions which
have  not  been satisfied and for which the First Party has terminated
this  Agreement  are reasonably capable of being performed or caused to be
performed  by the  First Party or have not been satisfied by reason of a
default by  the First  Party hereunder, the First Party shall be released
from all obligations  hereunder, except as contemplated in Section 10.10;

any of its assets is subject or grant access to any of its  proprietary,
confidential or classified information. MDS, Buyer and any  Designated Buyer

The  Buyer  and each Designated Buyer Affiliate hereby agrees to (and to

relating thereto  and the remedies for breach thereof, to which the
applicable MDS Contracting  Party (and its Affiliates) is subject pursuant to
the agreements executed in  connection with the sale of the MDS diagnostics
business in the United States,  as such agreements are listed in Section
7.12  of the  Disclosure Letter (the " **U.S.  Non-Competition Agreements**
"),  to  the same extent (including for the periods of time) as the
applicable MDS  Contracting Party (and its Affiliates), as if Buyer and the
Designated Buyer  Affiliates were the original MDS Contracting Party under
such U.S.  Non-Competition Agreements. For certainty, such non-competition
covenants,  non-solicitation covenants, the waivers of defences relating
thereto and the  remedies for breach thereof consist of those provisions set
out opposite the  applicable U.S. Non-Competition Agreements in Section
7.12  of the  Disclosure Letter. The Buyer and its Designated Buyer
Affiliates acknowledge  and  agree that the covenants set forth in this
Section are reasonable, properly  required in the circumstances and are

assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer  and  its Designated Buyer
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement and the BC Purchase  Agreement.

**8.4** **Agency  for Representatives**

 

 

Each  Party agrees that it accepts each indemnity in favour of any of its 
Representatives as agent and trustee of that Representative and MDS accepts 
each  indemnity in favour of the other Sellers and their Representatives as
agent  and  trustee of that Seller and Representative. Each Party agrees

Representatives on behalf  of that Representative (and in the case of MDS, on
behalf of the other Sellers  and their Representatives).

 

 

**8.5** **Notice  of the Defence of Third Party Claims**

 

 

If  an  Indemnified Party receives notice of the commencement or assertion
of any Third  Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifier
reasonably prompt  written notice thereof, but in any event no later than 30
days after receipt  of  such notice of such Third Party Claim. Such notice
to the Indemnifier shall  describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail
and shall indicate, if  reasonably practicable, the estimated amount of the
Loss that has been or may  be  sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifier shall have the right to  participate in or, by giving notice to
that effect to the Indemnified Party  not  later than 30 days after receipt
of such notice of such Third Party Claim and  subject to the rights of any
insurer or other third party having potential  liability therefor, to elect
to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim  at  the Indemnifier's own
expense and by such Indemnifier's own counsel, and the  Indemnified Party
shall co-operate in good faith in such defence. The  Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defence of any  Third Party Claim
assisted by counsel of its own choosing at the Indemnified  Party's expense.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third  Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifier.

 

 

**8.6** **Assistance  for Third Party Claims**

 

 

The  Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to
make  available to the Party which is undertaking and controlling the defence
of  any  Third Party Claim,

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

those  employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to 
assist  such Party in evaluating and in defending any Third Party Claim; 
and 

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

all  documents, records and other materials in the possession of such 
Party  reasonably required by such Party for its use in defending any Third 
Party  Claim,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

and  shall  otherwise co-operate with the Party defending such Third Party
Claim. The  Indemnifier shall be responsible for all reasonable expenses
associated with  making such documents, records and materials available and
for all reasonable  expenses of any employees made available by the
Indemnified Party to the  Indemnifier hereunder, which expense shall be equal
to an amount to be mutually  agreed upon per person per hour or per day for
each day or portion thereof  that  such employees are assisting the
Indemnifier but such expenses shall not exceed  the actual direct out-of
pocket cost to the Indemnified Party associated with  such employees.

 

 

**8.7** **Settlement  of Third Party Claims**

 

 

If  an  Indemnifier elects to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim as
provided  in  Section 8.5,  the  Indemnifier shall not be liable for any
legal expenses subsequently incurred  by  the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defence of such Third Party Claim.  However, if the
Indemnifier fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend  diligently
such Third Party Claim within 15 days after receiving notice from  the 
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party bona fide believes on
reasonable  grounds that the Indemnifier has failed to take such steps, the
Indemnified  Party may, at its option, elect to assume the defence of and to
compromise  or  settle the Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own
choosing and the  Indemnifier shall be liable for all reasonable costs and
expenses paid or  incurred in connection therewith; provided that the
Indemnified Party shall  not  enter into any compromise or settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the  prior written consent of the Indemnifier,
which shall not be unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 

**8.8** **Direct  Claims**

 

 

Any  Direct Claim shall be asserted by giving the Indemnifier reasonably
prompt  written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 days after
the  Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The Indemnifier
shall  then  have a period of 15 days within which to respond in writing to
such Direct  Claim. If the Indemnifier does not so respond within such 15 day
period, the  Indemnifier shall be deemed to have rejected such Claim, and in
such event  the  Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as
may be available  to  the Indemnified Party.

 

 

**8.9** **Failure  to Give Timely Notice**

 

 

A  failure  to give timely notice as provided in this Article 8  shall 
not affect the rights or obligations of the Indemnifier or Indemnified Party 
except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any such
party  which was entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to
recover  any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise
directly  and materially damaged as a result of such failure or whose rights
were  materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

 

**8.10** **Limitation**

 

 

Claims  for indemnification made by Buyer, any Designated Buyer Affiliate or
the  Representative of Buyer or a Designated Buyer Affiliate against any
Seller  shall  be limited as follows:

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

in  respect of Claims made under Subsection 8.2(a)  (other than a Claim
resulting from a misrepresentation or breach  of  warranty in respect of a
representation or warranty in Subsection  4.1.26)  no Losses shall be
recoverable until the aggregate of all Losses  suffered  or incurred by
Buyer, any Designated Buyer Affiliate or the Representative  of Buyer or a
Designated Buyer Affiliate in respect of all  misrepresentations or breaches
of warranty made or given by MDS in  this  Agreement or in any Closing
Document exceeds 0.5% of the Purchase  Price in  the aggregate in which
event the amount of all such Losses in excess  of  such amount may be
recovered by Buyer or the applicable Designated  Buyer  Affiliate or
Representative, as applicable; 

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

the  maximum aggregate liability of Sellers to Buyer, any Designated Buyer 
Affiliate and their Representatives for Losses pursuant to Section  8.2 
shall not exceed 30% of the Purchase Price other than Losses resulting 
directly from the intentional breach of this Agreement or any Closing 
Document by a Seller or a Seller's fraudulent or deceitful act;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

if  any Applicable Law would give Buyer, any Designated Buyer Affiliate  or
the  Representative of Buyer or a Designated Buyer Affiliate the right, 
notwithstanding the express terms of Section 4.5  or  8.2  to  the
contrary, to make a claim in respect of a breach of a representation  or
warranty made or given by a Seller in this Agreement or in any  Closing 
Document after the expiry of the survival period set forth in Section  4.5 
with respect to such representation and warranty, the Parties agree  that 
the aggregate Losses suffered or incurred by Buyer, any Designated  Buyer 
Affiliate or the Representative of Buyer or a Designated Buyer Affiliate  as
a result of, or arising in connection with, any such Claim shall  be  deemed
to be limited to $1.00 and Buyer and each Designated Buyer  Affiliate hereby
forever waives, releases and discharges each Seller  from  any Loss in
excess of such deemed  amount.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**8.11** **Reductions  and Subrogation**

 

 

If  the  amount of any Loss incurred by an Indemnified Party at any time
subsequent  to  the making of an Indemnity Payment is reduced by

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

any  net Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party;  or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

any  recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance 
coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment  by or 
against any other Person,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

the  Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifier in writing of
the nature  and amount of such reduction (and any costs, expenses (including
Taxes) or  premiums incurred in connection therewith), and the amount of such
reduction  (less any such costs, expenses (including Taxes) or premiums)
shall promptly  be  repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifier. Upon
making an Indemnity  Payment, the Indemnifier shall, to the extent of such
Indemnity Payment, be  subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
against any third party in  respect of the Loss to which the Indemnity
Payment relates. Until the  Indemnified Party recovers full payment of its
Loss, any and all claims of  the  Indemnifier against any such third party
on account of such Indemnity Payment  shall be postponed and subordinated in
right of payment to the Indemnified  Party's rights against such third party.

 

 

**8.12** **Exclusive  Remedy**

 

 

The  rights of indemnity set forth in this Article 8  are the  sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer and each Designated Buyer Affiliate on the  one
hand and the Sellers on the other in respect of any misrepresentation, 
breach of warranty or breach of covenant by the other hereunder or under any 
Closing Document (other than the rights of termination in Section 6.4  or a 
claim for specific performance or injunctive relief).

 

 

**8.13** **Duty  to Mitigate**

 

 

Nothing  in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or limit the general
obligation  at  law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any Loss which it
may suffer or incur  by  reason of the breach by an Indemnifier of any
representation, warranty or  covenant of the Indemnifier hereunder or under
any Closing Document. If any  Loss  can be reduced by any recovery,
settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to  any  insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment  by  or against any
other Person, the Indemnified Party shall take all appropriate  steps to
enforce such recovery, settlement or payment.

 

 

**8.14** **General  Limitations**

 

 

An  Indemnifier shall have no liability to an Indemnified Party hereunder or
under  any Closing Document:

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

for  any Liability which arises solely by reason of a proposed or actual 
enactment or change of any applicable Tax legislation or any proposed  or 
actual change in the interpretation or administration of such legislation 
after the date hereof;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

for  any Liability that arises as a result of any legislation not in force 
on  the date hereof which takes effect retrospectively or occurs as a 
consequence of a change in the interpretation of the law after the  date 
hereof;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

in  respect of any matter or thing done or omitted to be done by or at

of  this  Agreement (but otherwise without limitation or restriction), the

affiliates (including the  Designated Buyer Affiliates, as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement)  and to  such other persons as Borealis determines
is reasonably necessary or required  or  desirable in, and solely for the
purposes of, the conduct, support and  continued  evolution of the

(ii) sublicense pursuant to a written agreement that is  materially and
substantially consistent with the terms and conditions of  this  Agreement,

Business.

modify,  adapt, change, customize, enhance and make derivatives of, the
Licensed  Materials, solely for the Permitted Use in accordance with this

to provide or make available to Borealis  any  employee, contractor, agent
or other representative of MDS or any affiliate  of  MDS. Borealis also
acknowledges and agrees that the license of the Licensed  Materials hereunder
does not obligate MDS to permit Borealis or any authorized  user to access
any computer systems of MDS or any affiliate of MDS.

 

2.3   **Licensed Materials Ownership** : Borealis  acknowledges and agrees
that MDS and its licensors are and shall remain  the sole  and exclusive
owners of all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed  Materials,
including all copyright, trademarks, patents, trade secrets  and all  other
intellectual property or proprietary rights therein.

 

2.4   **Improvements Ownership** : MDS acknowledges and agrees that 
ownership of, and all right, title and interest in and to (including all 
copyright, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and all other intellectual 
property rights therein), any modifications, improvements, adaptations,

Materials  (" **Improvements** ") made by Borealis shall be owned solely
and  exclusively by Borealis.

 

2.5   **Confidential Information** :

 

(a)   The Licensed Materials are the confidential information of MDS.
Borealis  agrees  that it shall take reasonable measures to keep secure and
protect the Licensed  Materials from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss
and theft and to maintain  the confidentiality of all Licensed Materials in
its possession or control,  which measures shall in any event be no less than
the measures it uses  to  maintain the confidentiality of its own
confidential information of similar  importance. Borealis shall not disclose
to any person any of the Licensed  Materials except as expressly permitted in
this Agreement. Borealis may  disclose  the Licensed Materials (or parts
thereof): (i) to the extent required by  compulsion of law, including by
order of a court or other governmental  authority  of competent
jurisdiction, or otherwise as required by applicable law;  (ii) to  its
officers, directors, personnel, professional advisors, third parties  (as
is  permitted under Section 2.2(b) above), provided, however, that prior to 
such  disclosure, Borealis shall inform such persons of the confidential
nature  of the  Licensed Materials and shall be responsible to ensure that
all persons  to whom  it discloses the Licensed Materials comply with the
terms hereof; (iii)  to the  extent, as established by reliable evidence,
that such information is publicly  available when it was received by or
became known to Borealis (including  because  and to the extent it had
previously been disclosed by MDS in the course  of the  conduct of the MDS
Diagnostic Division), or which subsequently entered  the  public domain,
through no fault of or breach of the terms of this Agreement  by  Borealis
(but only after it enters the public domain); (iv) which, as  established by
reliable evidence, is already known to Borealis at the time  of  its
disclosure to Borealis by MDS provided that the receipt of such information 
was not made pursuant to an obligation of confidentiality between MDS and 
Borealis or in contravention of this Agreement or was not made by a person 
in  contravention of an obligation of confidence of any kind that is, or
reasonably  ought to be known, by Borealis.

 

(b)   Borealis agrees that in the event it or any person(s) authorized
hereunder  to  use the Licensed Materials is requested pursuant to, or
required by, applicable  law, regulation or legal process to disclose the
Licensed Materials or  any  portion thereof, it shall notify MDS promptly in
writing so that MDS may  seek a  protective order or other appropriate
remedy. Borealis and such authorized  person(s) shall consent to MDS
obtaining any protective order or other  appropriate remedy that it and/or
its affiliates may seek for the purpose  of  preventing disclosure of any of
the Licensed Materials to the public. In  the event that no such protective
order or other remedy is obtained, Borealis  and such authorized person(s)
shall furnish only that portion of the Licensed  Materials which it is
advised by legal counsel is legally required and  shall  take all
commercially reasonable steps, to the extent permitted by law,  to  remove
from such portion of the Licensed Materials that is required to  be 
disclosed any information that is commercially sensitive to MDS.

 

(c)   Borealis acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of any of
the  covenants or provisions contained in this Section 2.5 may cause MDS
and/or  its  affiliates to suffer irreparable harm which could not be
adequately compensated  for by damages. In such circumstances, Borealis
agrees that MDS and/or its  affiliates shall be entitled to seek to enforce
the performance of this  Agreement by equitable relief (including injunction
or specific performance)  upon application to a court of competent
jurisdiction. Any such relief or  remedy shall not be exclusive, but shall be
in addition to all other available  legal or equitable remedies. Borealis
agrees that the provisions of this  Section 2.5 are fair and reasonable in
the commercial circumstances of  this  Agreement, and that MDS has relied on
such provisions in entering into  this  Agreement

 

2.6   **Limited Warranty**. MDS warrants to Borealis that it has full  power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, it has all necessary  rights to 
perform its obligations herein and to grant the Licensed Rights and that 
the  execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement are not to any
extent  limited or restricted by, and are not in conflict with, any
obligations,  agreement or instrument to which it is either bound or subject.

 

2.7   **Disclaimer Of Warranties** : OTHER THAN THE LIMITED WARRANTIES 
EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THIS AGREEMENT, MDS MAKES, AND THERE ARE, NO OTHER 
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE 
LICENSED MATERIALS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, ARISING OUT OF  A
COURSE  OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO,  ANY  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR
ADEQUACY  FOR ANY  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL 
OR  CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY MANNER FROM THIS
AGREEMENT  AND  THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER,
WHETHER BASED  IN  CONTRACT (INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH AND BREACH OF A
FUNDAMENTAL TERM),  TORT  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, IN LAW OR
EQUITY, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EACH
PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY AND  OBLIGATION TO THE OTHER, IN THE AGGREGATE
(INCLUDING CLAIMS MADE UNDER  SECTION  2.9) FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY CONNECTION WITH THIS  AGREEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY

HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000).

 

2.9   **Remedies and Limitation** :

 

(a)  Subject  to Section 2.8, in the event of any claim, suit, action,
threat, allegation  or  proceeding by any third party ("Claim") against
Borealis (and any other  person  authorized hereunder to use the Licensed
Materials) arising out of, or  otherwise  related to the use of the Licensed
Materials (or any part thereof) as and  to the  extent permitted under this
Agreement infringes any patent, trade secret,  confidentiality, copyright or
any other intellectual property rights of  that  person, such Claim shall be
deemed to be a breach by MDS of this Agreement  and  MDS shall indemnify and
hold harmless, and at the option of Borealis, defend  Borealis, its
affiliates and any other person authorized hereunder to use  the  Licensed
Materials and their respective directors, officers and employees  from  any
and all liabilities, damages, losses and expenses (including legal  fees
and  expenses) arising out of such Claim, provided that with respect to
such  Claim:  (i) the indemnity conditions described in Section 2.9(c) below
are complied  with; and (ii) the infringement does not result from any
Improvements made  by  Borealis (or on its behalf by a third party), or the
use or operation of  the  Licensed Materials in combination with any
Improvements, or other software,  products, data, apparatus or equipment.

 

(b)  Subject  to Section 2.8, in the event of any Claim against MDS arising
out of, or  otherwise related to, any allegation that the use of the
Improvements (or  any  part thereof) by Borealis (or any other person
authorized hereunder to  use the  Licensed Materials) infringes any patent,
trade secret, confidentiality,  copyright or any other intellectual property
rights of that person, Borealis  shall indemnify and hold harmless, and at
the option of MDS defend, MDS  and its  affiliates and their respective
directors, officers and employees from  any and  all liabilities, damages,
losses and expenses (including legal fees and  expenses) arising out of such
Claim, provided that with respect to such  Claim  the indemnity
preconditions described in Section 2.9(c) below are complied  with.

 

(c)  To  receive the indemnities contained in this Section 2.9, each Party
seeking  indemnification shall provide: (i) prompt written notice of the
Claim to  the  indemnifying Party; (ii) all reasonable information and
assistance which  the  indemnifying Party may reasonably require to defend
the Claim; and (iii)  the  other party with sole control of the defence of
the Claim, and all negotiations  for its settlement or compromise, provided
that neither Party may settle  any  Claim without the prior written consent
of the other Party which consent  will  not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and provided further that the  failure  to give such notice,
information and assistance or to provide such control shall  not relieve the
indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations pursuant  to this
Section except to the extent that the indemnifying Party was actually 
prejudiced by such failure.

 

**3.0    TERMINATION**

 

3.1   **Termination** : MDS acknowledges and confirms that the use  by
Borealis of the Licensed Materials is required for the ongoing operation 
of  the Diagnostics Operations and therefore, after Closing, this Agreement 
(including the license granted hereunder) may only be terminated as follows: 
(a) upon mutual agreement of the Parties set out in writing; and  (b) by
Borealis at any time on notice to MDS. MDS agrees that the foregoing 
limitation is fair and reasonable in the commercial circumstances of this 
Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the BC Purchase Agreement and 
agrees  not to assert any right to, and hereby waives to the maximum extent
permitted  by  law, its right to terminate this Agreement inclusive of any
Licensed Rights.  For  certainty, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant

held to be a waiver of any other breach, or a waiver of,  acquiescence in, or
consent to, any further or succeeding breach  hereof.

**2.4   Non-Solicitation** **by MDS and  Affiliates**

 

MDS  acknowledges that the Transferred Employees are a key component of
carrying  on  the Canadian Diagnostics Business and therefore agrees to the
covenant  in this  Section 2.4. Accordingly, MDS agrees that, for a period
of three (3) years  after the Closing, neither MDS nor any of its Affiliates
shall, on their  own  behalf or on behalf of, or together with, any Person,
directly or indirectly,  solicit, employ, or offer employment to, any

**2.5   MDS Acknowledgement**

 

MDS: (i) acknowledges  and agrees  that it has carefully considered with the

provisions of Sections 2.2 and 2.4 are  reasonable and necessary to protect
and preserve Buyer's interests in and right  to use the Purchased Assets and
the operation of the Canadian Diagnostics  Business (as such business is
carried on as of the date hereof) from and  after  Closing; (iii)
irrevocably waives (and agrees not to raise) as a defence  any  issue of

may  suffer irreparable harm if MDS or its Affiliates breach any of their

its Affiliates  of  the provisions of Sections 2.2 and 2.4. Accordingly, in
the event of a  breach or threatened breach by MDS or any of its Affiliates
of any of the  provisions of Sections 2.2 and 2.4, in addition to any remedy

**2.6   Non-Solicitation by Buyer and Affiliates**

 

Buyer acknowledges that  the  employees of MDS and its Affiliates other than
those who from and after  the date  of this Agreement become employees of
Buyer (in accordance with the Purchase  Agreements or after Closing in
accordance with and as contemplated by the  Parties in connection with a
Migration Project (as defined in the Migration  Agreement)) (" **MDS
Employees** ") are a key component of carrying  on MDS' businesses and
therefore agrees to the covenant in this Section  2.6. Accordingly, Buyer

Buyer, any Designated Buyer Affiliate (as defined  in and  pursuant to the
Purchase Agreements), any BC Operator (as defined in the  Ontario  Purchase
Agreement) excluding Metro GP, Mether LP and Mether GP (as each  is  defined

a Designated Buyer Affiliate or BC Operator) (each a " **Buyer  Entity** ")
shall, on their own behalf or on behalf of, or together with,  any Person,
directly or indirectly, solicit, employ, or offer employment  to any  MDS
Employee. For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not apply in  respect
of OMERS Administration Corporation or any of its Affiliates that  is not  a
Buyer Entity. However, Buyer shall not and shall cause the other Buyer 
Entities not to encourage, assist or facilitate the solicitation or hiring 
of  any MDS Employees by OMERS Administration Corporation or any of its
Affiliates  that is not a Buyer Entity including by disclosing any
information about  any MDS  Employee.

 

**2.7   Buyer Acknowledgement**

 

Buyer acknowledges and  agrees  that: (i) it has carefully considered with

covenant set forth in Section 2.6;  (ii) the provisions of Section 2.6 are
reasonable and necessary to protect  and preserve MDS' interests in and right
to carry on its business from and after  Closing; (iii) MDS may suffer
irreparable harm if Buyer or its Affiliates  breach  any of their
obligations set out in Section 2.6; and (iv) monetary damages  may  not be a
sufficient remedy for a breach by Buyer or its Affiliates of the  provisions
of Section 2.6. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or  threatened breach
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any of the provisions  of  Section 2.6,
in addition to any remedy provided for at law or in equity,  MDS  shall be
entitled to seek equitable relief, including an interim injunction, 
interlocutory injunction and permanent injunction or specific performance 
or  both.

 

**2.8   Accounting for Profits**

 

If either Party or its  Affiliates  breaches any of its obligations as set
out in this Agreement the other  Party  shall be entitled to seek an
accounting and repayment of any and all profits,  compensation, royalties,
commissions, remunerations or benefits which the  breaching Party or its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall have realized  or may realize as a
result of, arising out of, or in connection with, any  such  breach.

 

**2.9   Other Remedies**

 

The rights of each Party  hereunder shall be in addition to any and all other
remedies available  to it and  shall not be construed to prevent it from
pursuing, either consecutively  or  concurrently, any and all other legal or
equitable remedies available to  it  including the recovery of monetary
damages.

 

**2.10   Effective Time**

 

Notwithstanding anything  in this  Agreement, the terms and provisions

**SCHEDULE  5.9**

 

 

 

**SUPPORT  SERVICES AGREEMENT 
TERM SHEET**

 

 

 

**A.  Remaining AutoLabs Contracts**

 

**Purpose**

 

To the extent that any of the contracts  listed  on Schedule "A" hereto (the
**" AutoLabs Contracts"**) have not been  validly assigned to the Buyer or an
applicable Designated Buyer Affiliate  (a " **Buyer Entity** ") on the
Closing Date (such non-assigned AutoLabs  Contracts, the **" Remaining
AutoLabs Contracts"**), notwithstanding  Section 2.3 of the Agreement, then
under the terms of the Support  Services  Agreement, a Buyer Entity will
assume responsibility for the performance  of all  services, covenants and
obligations under such contracts.

 

**Performance of  Obligations**

 

Pursuant to the Support Services  Agreement,  from and after the Closing
Date, MDS or the MDS entity party to the  applicable  contract (the " **MDS
Contracting Party** ") will hold the Remaining  AutoLabs Contracts in trust
for the applicable Buyer Entity, and  the Buyer  Entity will be required to
assume and perform all of the covenants  and  obligations of the MDS
Contracting Parties under the Remaining AutoLabs  Contracts under such trust
arrangement until the earliest of: (i)  such contract  being validly
assigned to a Buyer Entity; (ii) such contract being  validly  assigned to a
service provider (e.g. [REDACTED]), provided that the  MDS  Contracting
Party is released from any obligations or liabilities  in respect of  future
performance under the contract; (iii) the expiration or termination  of 
such contract, or (iv) the extension, amendment or renewal of such  contract
to  remove the MDS Contracting Party as a party to the contract. The 
performance by the Buyer Entity will be in accordance with the terms  of
the  applicable Remaining AutoLabs Contract. For certainty, the MDS
Contracting  Party shall not, without the written consent of Buyer, have the
right  to  terminate or refuse to extend or renew a Remaining AutoLabs
Contract  if such  termination, non-extension or non-renewal could, pursuant
to the  terms of the  applicable AutoLabs Contract, result in the right of
the applicable  third party  to obtain the source code for the software
licensed to such person  pursuant to  the applicable AutoLabs Contract.

 

The applicable Buyer Entity will  grant the  applicable MDS Contracting
Party a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable  license to the AutoLabs
Assets to extent required to effect the license  of the  AutoLabs Assets to
the applicable third party. Each applicable MDS  Contracting  Party shall
indemnify Buyer and the applicable Buyer Entity from  any breach of  such
license.

 

Each applicable MDS Contracting  Party shall  take or provide such
reasonable action, assistance and/or information  so as to  provide the
applicable Buyer Entity with the benefits of and to allow  the  applicable
Buyer Entity to comply with the obligations under the  Remaining  AutoLabs
Contracts, and each applicable MDS Contracting Party shall  pay over to 
Buyer all money received by such MDS Contracting Party in respect  of
services  performed by a Buyer Entity under each Remaining AutoLabs
Contract  within a ten  (10) business days **)** following receipt of such
money.

 

Buyer shall be responsible for any  failure to  perform the services,
covenants and obligations under the Remaining  AutoLabs  Contracts, except
to the extent caused by MDS.

 

**B.  U.S. Transition Services  Contracts**

 

**" U.S. Transition Services  Contracts" **means the U.S. Support Services
Contracts relating to the  provision of  transition services in connection
with the sale of the diagnostics  business in  the U.S. to (i) [REDACTED],
as are more particularly set out and  described in  Schedule "B" hereto.

 

Pursuant to the Support Services  Agreement,  from and after the Closing
Date, the applicable Buyer Entity will  use  commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the applicable MDS Contracting  Party  with services, on a sub-
contract basis, as may be required to enable  such MDS  Contracting Party to
fulfill its obligations under the U.S. Transition  Services  Contracts (the
**" Transition Support Services"**). Buyer and MDS  acknowledge that the
performance of any such sub-contracting arrangement  shall  be on terms and
conditions that provide for the ownership and licensing  of work  product,
the protection of confidential information and privacy related  obligations
in a manner consistent with the applicable U.S. Transition  Services 
Contracts.

 

The Transition Support Services  shall be  provided on a cost-recovery
basis, with customary provisions for  verification of  such costs by MDS.
Each applicable MDS Contracting Party shall pay  to Buyer the  costs
incurred by applicable Buyer Entity in respect of services  performed by 
such Buyer Entity within a ten (10) business days) following receipt  of
the  applicable Buyer Entity invoice.

 

The liability of the Buyer Entity  in  connection with its performance of
the Transition Support Services  will be  subject to a customary limitation
of liability. The Buyer Entity  will only be  liable for direct damages (and
not any indirect damages of any kind  or nature  whatsoever).

The MDS Entities, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities,  on the  other hand, shall protect, to the same extent and in the same manner  as it  protects its own confidential information (provided that such standard  is not  less than commercially reasonable efforts), all Information of the  other that it  retains in its respective possession or under its respective control  from all  harm, loss, theft, reproduction and unauthorized access and shall ensure  that  such Information is not disclosed, published, released, transferred  or otherwise  made available in any form to, for the use or benefit of, any Person  except as  provided in this Agreement, without the prior written approval of Buyer  or MDS,  as applicable.

published  policies of applicable securities regulators and applicable stock
exchange  rules);

6.  Each  Party  acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of any of the covenants  or  provisions contained herein would cause the other Party and/or any  of the other  Party's Affiliates to suffer irreparable harm which could not be adequately  compensated for by damages. In such circumstances, subject to Section 3,  each Party agrees that the other Party and/or its Affiliates shall,  in addition  to any other remedy or relief, be entitled to seek to enforce the performance  of  this Agreement by equitable relief (including injunction or specific  performance) upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction  without proof  of actual damage to such Party or its Affiliates and notwithstanding  that  damages may be readily quantifiable, and each Party agrees not to contest,  object to, or otherwise delay, obstruct or oppose (including by pleading  sufficiency of damages as a defence) an application for equitable relief  by any  other Party in the circumstances of such threatened or actual breach,  on notice  or _ex parte_ , and hereby waive any and all immunities from injunctive or  other equitable relief to which they may be entitled. Any such relief or  remedy shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to all other  available  legal or equitable remedies.

8.   Each Party agrees that in the event it or any of its Representatives  are  requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law, regulation or  legal  process (other than under applicable securities laws, published policies  of  applicable securities regulators or any applicable stock exchange rules)  to  disclose any Information of the other Party, it shall notify the other  Party  promptly in writing so that the other Party may seek a protective order  or other  appropriate remedy. The notifying Party shall consent to the other  obtaining any protective order or other appropriate remedy that it  and/or its  Affiliates may seek for the purpose of preventing disclosure of any  of the  Information to the public. In the event that no such protective order or  other remedy is obtained, such Party shall furnish only that portion  of the  other Party's Information which it is advised by legal counsel is legally  required and shall take all commercially reasonable steps, to the extent  permitted by law, to remove from such Information that is required  to be  disclosed any information that is commercially sensitive to the other. 

 

9.   Each Party agrees that all of the terms, conditions and restrictions  in this  Agreement are reasonable in the circumstances and are intended to protect,  in  the case of Buyer, Buyer's substantial investment and legitimate business  interests in carrying on the specimen collection and diagnostic services  business carried on by the Buyer after the date of this Agreement,  and, in the  case of MDS, MDS' businesses and the businesses of its Affiliates, other than  the MDS Diagnostics Division. Nevertheless, if any such restrictions shall  be held invalid, the remaining restrictions shall not be so affected.  In  addition, if any amendment to any restriction would be necessary in  order to  ensure its validity, such restriction shall apply with such amendment  or  modification as may be necessary to make it valid and effective.

 

10.   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed, by implication,  estoppel  or otherwise, as a grant of a licence to use any of the Information  of the other  Party.

 

11.   A Party's obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement survives  indefinitely. 

 

12.   This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining  to  the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings,  negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written.

 

13.   No waiver of or consent to depart from the requirements of any provision  of this  Agreement shall be binding on a Party and/or its Affiliates unless  it is in  writing and is signed by such Party. Such waiver or consent shall be  effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose  for which  it has been given. No failure on the part of a Party to exercise, and no  delay in exercising, any right under this Agreement shall operate as  a waiver of  such right. No single or partial exercise of any such right shall preclude  any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any  other  right.

Rules of Procedure for  Arbitration**

 

The following rules and procedures  shall apply  with respect to any matter
to be arbitrated by the Parties under  the terms of  the Agreement.

 

1.   INITIATION OF ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

 

(a)   If any Party to this Agreement wishes to have any dispute under
Sections  3.4,  3.5 and 3.6 and Schedule 3.1 arbitrated in accordance with
the provisions  of  this Agreement, it shall give notice to the other Party
hereto specifying  particulars of the matter or matters in dispute and
proposing the  name of the  person it wishes to be the single arbitrator.
Within 15 days after receipt  of such notice, the other Party to this
Agreement shall give notice  to the first  Party advising whether such Party
accepts the arbitrator proposed  by the first  Party. If such notice is not
given within such 15 day period, the other  Party shall be deemed to have
accepted the arbitrator proposed by  the first  Party. If the Parties do not
agree upon a single arbitrator within such  15  day period, either party may
request that the ADR Institute of Canada,  Inc.  select a single arbitrator
(the " **Arbitrator** ").

 

(b)   The individual selected as Arbitrator shall be qualified by education 
and  experience to decide the matter in dispute. The Arbitrator shall be at 
arm's length from both Parties and shall not be a member of the audit  or
legal  firm or firms who advise either Party, nor shall the Arbitrator be 
an individual  who is, or is a member of a firm, otherwise regularly retained
by  either of the  Parties.

 

2.   SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN STATEMENTS

 

(a)   Within 30 days of the appointment of the Arbitrator, the Party
initiating  the  arbitration (the " **Claimant** ") shall send the other
Party (the " **Respondent** ") a Statement of Claim setting  out in
sufficient  detail the facts and any contentions of law on which it relies,
and  the relief  that it claims.

 

(b)   Within 30 days of the receipt of the Statement of Claim, the
Respondent  shall  send the Claimant a Statement of Defence stating in
sufficient detail  which of  the facts and contentions of law in the
Statement of Claim it admits  or denies,  on what grounds, and on what other
facts and contentions of law it  relies.

 

(c)   Within 15 days of receipt of the Statement of Defence, the Claimant 
may send the  Respondent a Statement of Reply.

 

(d)   All Statements of Claim, Defence and Reply shall be accompanied by 
copies (or,  if they are especially voluminous, lists) of all essential
documents  on which  the Party concerned relies and which have not
previously been submitted  by any  Party.

 

(e)   After submission of all the Statements, the Arbitrator will give 
directions for  the further conduct of the arbitration.

 

3.   MEETINGS AND HEARINGS

 

(a)   The arbitration shall take place in the City of Toronto, Ontario  or
in such  other place as the Claimant and the Respondent shall agree upon in 
writing  within 5 days after the Statements of Claim, Defence and Reply
have  been  delivered. The arbitration shall be conducted in English unless
otherwise  agreed by such Parties and the Arbitrator. Subject to any
adjournments  which the Arbitrator allows, the final hearing will be
continued  on successive  working days until it is concluded.

 

(b)   All meetings and hearings will be in private unless the Parties
otherwise  agree.

 

(c)   Any Party may be represented at any meetings or hearings by legal 
counsel.

 

(d)   Each Party may examine, cross-examine and re-examine all witnesses  at
the  arbitration.

 

4.   THE DECISION

 

(a)   The Arbitrator will make a decision in writing and, unless the
Parties  otherwise  agree, will set out reasons for the decision in the
decision.

 

(b)   The Arbitrator will send the decision to the Parties as soon as
practicable  after the conclusion of the final hearing, but in any event no
