with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow

Fund Amount deposited with the Escrow Agent shall be applied by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to pay amounts
owing or payable, with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow

cash payable in respect of Options pursuant to Sections 2.09 and the cash

Payment, Per Option Closing Payment or Per Directly Exercisable Warrant
Closing Payment, as applicable.

 



23 (c) The remaining funds, if any, in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount following the determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and
the making of any payments from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to
Buyer required pursuant to Section 2.14(e) and/or to the Accounting Referee
required pursuant to Section 2.14(c), as applicable, shall be released from
the Purchase Price Escrow Account for distribution to the Holders in
accordance with Section 2.14.

 

 __(d) On the Interim Indemnity Escrow Release Date (or, if such day is not a
Business Day, the next Business Day thereafter), an amount equal to (x)
fifty percent (50%) of the funds deposited in the Indemnity Escrow Account on
the Closing Date _less_ (y) the aggregate amount of all Claims paid from the

(z) the aggregate amount of any outstanding and unpaid Claims made against the
Indemnity Escrow Account as of the Interim Indemnity Escrow Release Date,
shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account for distribution to the
Holders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. On the Final

Business Day thereafter), an amount equal to (x) the remaining funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account at such time _less_ (y) the aggregate amount of any
outstanding and unpaid Claims made in accordance with Article 9 against the
Indemnity Escrow Account as of the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date, shall
be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account for distribution to the Holders
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, if at any

any Claims, such funds shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account
for distribution to the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity Escrow Amount and all
interest and other amounts earned thereon in escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. Distributions of any funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall
be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. __

 

(e) On the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date (or, if such day is not a
Business Day, the next Business Day thereafter), the remaining funds in the
Holders Representative Expense Fund Account at such time shall be released
from the Holders Representative Expense Fund Account for deposit into an
account designated by the Holders Representative. Thereafter, based solely
on the Holders Representatives discretion, the Holders Representative shall
distribute all or portions of such funds, from time to time, to the Holders in
the proportions contemplated by Section 2.06(f). The Escrow Agent shall hold
the Holders Representative Expense Fund Amount and all interest and other
amounts earned thereon in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Upon
deposit into the account designated by the Holders Representative as
prescribed above, the remaining Holders Representative Expense Fund Amount
and all interest and other amounts earned thereon (collectively, "Income", and
together with such remaining Holders Representative Expense Fund Amount,
the "Holders Representative Expense Fund Property") shall be maintained by
the Holders Representative, and the Holders Representative shall have the
right to recover the Charges (as defined below) from the Holders
Representative Expense Fund Property. The Holders shall be responsible for and
shall pay and discharge all taxes, assessments and governmental charges
imposed on or with respect to the Holders Representative Expense
Fund Property. The Holders Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any funds or other assets

 



24  otherwise payable out of the Holders Representative Expense Fund Property
to any Holder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Holders
Representative is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Holders Representative so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Holders in respect of which the Holders
Representative made such deductions and withholding.

(f) Any amounts payable to or released to the Holders from the Escrow Account
(other than any release to the Holders Representative in its capacity as
such) will be released _pro rata_ to the Holders relative Remaining Possible
Consideration. Upon any such release from escrow, the total amount of any
such release payable to the Holders of Shares and Directly Exercisable
Warrants (the "Shares and Warrants Escrow Percentage") will be delivered to
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Shares and Directly
Exercisable Warrants, and the total amount of any such release payable to
Holders of Options (the "Options Escrow Percentage") will be delivered to the
Company for payment to the Option Holders.

 

Section 2.07. Surrender and Payment of Shares and Directly Exercisable
Warrants

 

(a) Each Holder whose Shares have been converted into the right to receive
payment pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of (i) certificate(s) representing Shares (the "Stock
Certificates") (or an affidavit and indemnity as contemplated by Section 2.12)
together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal or (ii)
uncertificated Shares by delivering to the Exchange Agent a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares (
_less_ any amounts deducted, pursuant to this Article 2, for deposit into the
Escrow Account, which amounts shall be deemed paid to the Holders for purposes
of this Section 2.07 in the manner and at the times set forth in Section 2.06
and Section 2.14). Until so surrendered, each such Stock Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such payment provided in Section 2.05. The Exchange Agent shall provide
confirmation of receipt of each Letter of Transmittal to Buyer in accordance
with the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the Exchange Agent was
retained (the "Paying Agent Agreement"). No Holder may modify the form or
substance of a Letter of Transmittal without the prior written approval of
Buyer. 

(b) The Exchange Agent shall pay the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
to the Stockholders in the following manner:

indemnity as contemplated by Section 2.12), together with a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, or in the case of uncertificated Shares, a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, to the Exchange Agent prior to the
determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, then such Stockholder
shall receive in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by such Stockholder in respect of each Share represented thereby
(A) in accordance with

Payment, (B) any additional payment in respect of such Share in accordance
with Section 2.14 following the determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase

with Section 2.06.

 

(ii) If any Stockholder surrenders its Stock Certificates (or an affidavit and
indemnity as contemplated by Section 2.12) together with a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, or in the case of uncertificated Shares, a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, to the Exchange Agent after the determination
of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, then such Stockholder shall receive in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by such
Stockholder in respect of each Share represented thereby payment of an amount
equal to (A) in accordance with the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, the
Per Share Closing Payment _plus_ any amounts due in respect of that Share in
accordance with Section 2.14 and (B) any additional payment in respect of such
Share in accordance with Section 2.06.

 

(c) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Stock Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Stock
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of any Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration upon the applicable Holders
compliance with Section 2.07(b). For purposes of such exchange, the cancelled
Common Stock shall be deemed surrendered pursuant to Section 2.07(b) as of the
date presented to the Surviving Corporation.

 

 __(e) Each Holder of Directly Exercisable Warrants immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of such Warrant, the Directly Exercisable Warrant Consideration for such
Directly Exercisable Warrant ( _less_ any amounts deducted pursuant to this
Article 2 for deposit into the Escrow Account), which amounts shall be
deemed paid to the Holders for purposes of this Section 2.07 in the manner
and at the times set forth in Section 2.06 and Section 2.14. Until so
surrendered, each such Directly Exercisable Warrant shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such payment
provided herein. __

 



26 (f) The Exchange Agent shall pay the applicable Directly Exercisable Warrant
Consideration to the Holders in the following manner:

(i) If any such Holder surrenders its Directly Exercisable Warrant to the
Exchange Agent prior to the determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase
Price, then such Holder shall receive in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account designated by such Holder (A) in accordance with the
terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, the applicable Directly Exercisable
Warrant Closing Payment, (B) any additional payment in respect of such
Directly Exercisable in accordance with Section 2.14 following the
determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and (C) any additional
payment in respect of such Directly Exercisable Warrant in accordance with
Section 2.06.

(ii) If any such Holder surrenders its Directly Exercisable Warrant to the
Exchange Agent after the determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price,
then such Holder shall receive in immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account designated by such Holder (A) in accordance with the terms of
the Paying Agent Agreement, the applicable Directly Exercisable Warrant
Closing Payment plus any additional payment in respect of such Directly
Exercisable in accordance with Section 2.14 following the determination of
the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and (B) any additional payment in respect
of such Directly Exercisable Warrant in accordance with Section 2.06.

 

Section 2.08. Appraisal Rights

 

 __Notwithstanding Section 2.05, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a Holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares
in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the
Effective Time, such Holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the
right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration ( _less_ any amounts deducted for deposit into the Escrow
Account). The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Buyer shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. __

Section 2.09. Cancellation and Payment of Options

 

(a) The compensation committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company
Board shall adopt resolutions and take all actions necessary or advisable
(including providing any required notices) to provide that (i) the Options, to
the extent unvested and unexercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable prior to the Effective Time, (ii) each Option Holder shall be
given the opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding Options prior to the
Effective Time on a cashless exercise basis based on the Estimated Per-Share
Merger Consideration for shares of Common Stock, (iii) the provisions of this
Section 2.09 shall be effectuated and (iv) the Equity

 



27  Incentive Plan and all other equity incentive plans of the Company shall be
terminated, effective as of the Closing Date. In the event that such Options
are not exercised prior to the Effective Time, such Options shall be
cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in accordance with Section 2.09(b).

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Option then issued
and outstanding (and not forfeited or canceled in accordance with its terms)
shall, without any action on the part of any party hereto or the Option Holder
thereof, be cancelled. In consideration of such cancellation, at Closing,
Buyer shall make available to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the
aggregate Option Closing Payment in respect of the outstanding Options _less_
any portion of such amount payable to Buyer in accordance with the
Contribution Agreement on the Option Holders behalf, to the extent set forth
on the Rollover Participants Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(b),
and (a) the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each Option Holder at the
Effective Time the Option Closing Payment for each Option _less_ any portion
of the Option Closing Payment deemed to be delivered to Buyer in accordance
with the Contribution Agreement on behalf of such Option Holders behalf, to
the extent set forth on the Rollover Participants Schedule delivered pursuant
to Section 5.05(b) (but treating, for withholding tax purposes, the Option
Closing Payment with respect to each Option as made without reduction for
the portion of such deduction attributable to the Holders Representative
Expense Fund Account) and (b) thereafter any subsequent additional payment in
respect of Options shall be made in accordance with Section 2.06 and Section
2.14 (for avoidance of doubt, without duplication of any amounts previously
paid to such Option Holders in accordance herewith). Each payment made to
Option Holders under this Section 2.09 shall be made on the same dates, and
subject to the same terms, as payments to the other Holders.

Section 2.10. Adjustments

 

If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of capital stock, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar event relating
to the capital stock, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, Option
Consideration and Warrant Consideration, and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.11. Withholding Rights

 

The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Buyer and/or the Surviving
Corporation so withhold amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder, Warrant
Holder or Option Holder, as applicable, in respect of which the Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, made such deduction and withholding.

 



28 Section 2.12. Lost Certificates

 

If any Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and the provision of an indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Stock represented by such
Stock Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

Section 2.13. Pre-Closing Estimate of the Aggregate Purchase Price

 

No later than three Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer, in conjunction with Buyers delivery to the
Company of the Rollover Participant Schedule pursuant to Section 5.05(b), a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the Companys good faith
estimate of (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Indebtedness, (iii) Company
Transaction Expenses, (iv) Closing Working Capital and (v) Notional Rollover
Share Merger Consideration (based on the Rollover Participant Schedule and the
other elements of the Closing Statement). The Company shall also deliver to
Buyer its good faith calculation, using the amounts set forth on the Closing
Statement, of the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price (the "Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price"), the estimated Per Share Merger Consideration (the
"Estimated Per Share Merger Consideration") in respect of each issued and
outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Share, Series A-2 Preferred Share, Series B
Preferred Share and each Common Share, the estimated Option Consideration
(the "Estimated Option Consideration") and the estimated Directly Exercisable
Warrant Consideration (the "Estimated Warrant Consideration") in respect of
each Series A-1 Preferred Warrant, Series A-2 Preferred Warrant, Series B
Preferred Warrant and Common Warrant and the amounts of the Per Share Closing
Payments and the Directly Exercisable Warrant Closing Payments based on the
foregoing calculations. The Company shall provide Buyer with access to such
information used by the Company in its calculation of such amounts as is
reasonably necessary for Buyer to review such amounts.

 

Section 2.14. Post-Closing Adjustment

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days, after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Holders
Representative a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth
Buyers calculation of (i) Closing Indebtedness, (ii) Closing Cash, (iii)
Company Transaction Expenses, (iv) Closing Working Capital and (v) Notional
Rollover Share Merger Consideration. Buyer shall also deliver to the Holders
Representative its calculation, using the amounts set forth on the Post-
Closing Statement, of the Aggregate Purchase Price, and the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share, Option Consideration in respect of
each Option and the Warrant Consideration in respect of each Warrant. Buyer
shall provide the Holders Representative with access to such information
used by Buyer in its calculation of such amounts as is reasonably necessary
for the Holders Representative to review such amounts.

 



29 (b) If the Holders Representative disagrees with Buyers calculation of any
of the items set forth on the Post-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 2.14(a), the Holders Representative may, within 30 days after receipt
of the Post-Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such
calculation, specifying the Holders Representatives calculation of such
amount and, in reasonable detail, the Holders Representatives grounds for
such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items
or amounts as to which the Holders Representative disagrees, and the
Holders Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items
and amounts contained in the Post-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 2.14(a).

 

(c) If the Holders Representative delivers a notice of disagreement pursuant
to Section 2.14(b), Buyer and the Holders Representative shall, during the
15 days after delivery thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
Aggregate Purchase Price. If Buyer and the Holders Representative are unable
to reach agreement as to such amount during such period, the parties shall
promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Referee to promptly review this
Section 2.14 (and any related definitions) and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Aggregate Purchase Price. In making such
calculation, such independent accounting firm shall (w) be limited to a review
of whether the disputed amounts were calculated in accordance with
this Section 2.14 (and any related definitions), (x) consider only those
items or amounts in the Post-Closing Statement as to which the Holders
Representative has disagreed and shall therefore be bound as to all other
matters and calculations as to which the Closing Statement and the Post-
Closing Statement are in accord, (y) be bound in all respects and for all
purposes by the definitions hereof and the Agreed Accounting Principles, and
shall not assign a value to any disputed amount greater than the higher of
the amounts proposed by Buyer and Holders Representative or less than the
lower of the amounts proposed by Buyer and Holders Representative, and (z)
not consider in any respect or for any purpose any settlement discussions or
settlement offer made by or on behalf of Buyer or the Holders, unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Holders Representative, and no party hereto
will disclose (or permit its representatives to disclose) to the Accounting
Referee any such discussions or offer. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to
Buyer and the Holders Representative, as promptly as practicable, a report
setting forth its calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price. Such report shall
be final and binding upon Buyer and the Holders Representative without any
right to appeal or bring suit to challenge the calculation of the Aggregate
Purchase Price (or any component or consequences thereof). The cost of such
review and report shall be borne (i) by the Holders, if the difference
between the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and the Holders Representatives
calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.14(b)
is greater than the difference between the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and
Buyers calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section
2.14(a), (ii) by Buyer, if the difference between the Final Aggregate Purchase
Price and the Holders Representatives calculation of Aggregate Purchase
Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.14(b) is less than the difference
between the Final Aggregate Purchase Price and Buyers calculation of
Aggregate Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.14(a) and (iii)
otherwise,

 



30  equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand. Costs
for which the Holders are responsible in accordance with the prior sentence
shall be paid from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account. In the event
that such costs exceed the remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount,
any excess shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account. If the Holders are
responsible for all or a part of the costs and expenses of such review and
report, Buyer and the Holders Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay out of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and/or the
Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, to the account(s) specified by the
Accounting Referee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a portion
of the amount held in such escrow account equal to the amount of the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Referee payable by the Holders, and the release of
amounts from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account by Sections 2.06(c)
and 2.14(e) shall be made after giving effect to such payment to the
Accounting Referee.

 

(d) The Holders Representative and Buyer agree that they shall, and Buyer
agrees to cause its and the Surviving Corporations respective independent
accountants and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price and in the conduct of the reviews
referred to in this Section 2.14, including making available to the extent
necessary books, records, work papers and personnel.

__(e) If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Purchase Price, then Buyer shall be entitled to (x) payment of an
amount equal to such shortfall from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account and (y) to receive from the Indemnity Escrow Account the additional
amount (if any) by which the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price. In the event that the Holders obligations
under this Section 2.14 exceed the sum of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount _plus_ the Indemnity Escrow Amount, such excess shall be paid to
Buyer by the Holders _pro rata_ to their relative Indemnity Percentages. If
the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price, then the Holders shall be entitled to payment of an amount
equal to such excess, to be paid by or on behalf of Buyer to the Exchange
Agent, and in turn to be distributed by the Exchange Agent among the Holders
_pro rata_ to their Remaining Possible Consideration. If any amounts remain in
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account after the applicable payment
pursuant to this Section 2.14(e), then such remaining amount shall be
promptly released from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account (i) to
the Exchange Agent, in respect of any Stockholders and Directly Exercisable
Warrant Holders, to be distributed by the Exchange Agent among such
Stockholders and Directly Exercisable Warrant Holders _pro rata_ to their
Remaining Possible Consideration and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation, in
respect of Option Holders to be distributed to such Option Holders _pro rata_
to their Remaining Possible Consideration. Any payment from Buyer or the
Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.14(e) shall be made within three
Business Days after the date on which the Final Aggregate Purchase Price has
been determined, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by Buyer or
the Escrow Agent (as directed by the parties), as the case may be, to the
applicable party or parties. Buyer and the Holders Representative shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent irrevocable instructions giving effect to any
payment or release provided for by this Section 2.14(e) in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. __

 



31 (f) "Final Aggregate Purchase Price" means the Aggregate Purchase Price (i)
as shown in Buyers calculation thereof set forth on the Post-Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.14, if the Holders Representative
does not deliver any notice of disagreement with respect thereto pursuant
to Section 2.14(b) or (ii) if the Holders Representative does deliver such a
notice of disagreement, (A) as agreed by Buyer and the Holders Representative
pursuant to Section 2.14(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as
determined by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.14(c).

Section 2.15. Tax Treatment

 

The parties intend the Indemnity Escrow Amount to qualify for installment sale
reporting under Section 453 of the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. All payments required pursuant to Section 2.14 will,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be deemed to be adjustments for Tax
purposes to the Aggregate Purchase Price paid by Buyer for the equity
interests of the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.16. Payments by Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any payments made by or on
behalf of Buyer, Merger Sub or, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at the direction of the Holders
Representative or, at or prior to the Closing, the Company, shall be deemed to
satisfy and discharge in full all of Buyers, Merger Subs and the Surviving
Corporations obligations and liability to the Holders Representative and the
Holders under this Agreement with respect thereto, regardless of whether such
payments are further distributed or paid to any Holder.

of its Investment Advisory Contracts and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent; _provided_  that the Companys obligations

Advisory Contract with an Investment Advisory Client to continue after the
Closing shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement (i) upon
receipt of written consent by the Investment Advisory Client or an agent of
such Investment Advisory Client as contemplated by the Consent Notice or (ii)

the receipt of such notice) (which Negative Consent Notice may be included in
the Consent Notice sent to such Investment Advisory Client or its agent)
requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing such Investment
Advisory Client: (A) of the intention to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which will result in a deemed assignment of

the existing Investment Advisory Contract with such Investment Advisory Client
after the Closing if such Investment Advisory Client does not terminate such
agreement prior to the Closing; and (C) that the consent of such Investment

written consent from such Investment Advisory Client or its agent as

 



62  contemplated by the Consent Notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in any

has not so consented or has terminated its Investment Advisory Contract, and
in each case such notice or termination has not been revoked. For the

counterparty to such agreement, and that consent from such counterparty or
counterparties obtained in accordance with this Section 5.13 shall be deemed

Investment Advisory Client referenced in such agreement (but not a party to
such agreement) for all purposes under this Agreement.

Consent Contract with an Investment Advisory Client, the Company shall use

such Investment Advisory Client or its agent, including by seeking to contact,

Period that would reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnity claim
under this Agreement.

 

(d) Buyer will not, and will not cause or permit the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, (i) take any action on the Closing Date other than
in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to the
distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption that could
give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) make any election or deemed election under Section
338 of the Code or (iii) make any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or waive
or extend any statute of limitations for the assessment or collection of
Taxes, in each case with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnity claim under this
Agreement, unless any such action (x) is required by Applicable Law or (y) the
Holders Representative gives its prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(e) Holders Representative shall have delivered to Buyer (i) a certification
for the Company, signed under penalties of perjury by the Company and dated
not more than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, that satisfies the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)
and confirms that the Company is not, nor has it been within 5 years of the
date of the certification, a "United States real property holding corporation"
as defined in Section 897 of the Code and (ii) a notice to the IRS, signed by
the Company, that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(2).

 



64 Section 6.02. Transfer Taxes

 

All excise, sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar
Taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and any expenses incurred in
connection therewith) shall be borne one-half by the Holders and one-half
by the Buyer. Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all
such Taxes, and, if required by applicable law, the Company will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

 

ARTICLE 7

Employee Matters

 

Section 7.01. Employee Benefits

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it shall, through the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, continue the employment of all of the employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Continuing Employees"). For a period beginning on the Effective Time and
continuing thereafter through December 31, 2015 (or, if shorter, during the
period of employment), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, provide the Continuing Employees with (i) base salary
or wage rates, incentive opportunities and severance plans and arrangements
that are no less favorable than the base salary or wage rates, incentive
opportunities and severance plans and arrangements provided to such Continuing
Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 __(b) From and after the Closing, with respect to any employee benefit plan
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee
becomes a participant, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation, paid time-off and severance plan and other benefit plan
accruals (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan),
each Continuing Employee s service with the Company or any of its Affiliates
(as well as service with any predecessor employer, to the extent service with
the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or any of its
Affiliates) shall be treated as service with Buyer and its Affiliates to the
same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Affiliates under a
comparable Employee Plan prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits. __

(c) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing, except to the extent that such preexisting conditions,
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting 

 



65  periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing. For the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or to cause its Affiliates to recognize, all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the Closing
for purposes of satisfying any analogous deductible and co-payment
limitations and out-of-pocket requirements under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.01(a), except as set forth on
Section 7.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, make payments to Continuing Employees
pursuant to annual cash incentive plans with respect to the annual performance
period in which the Closing Date occurs based on actual performance upon the
terms and conditions of such plans as in effect on the date hereof and
otherwise based on the allocation by the Compensation Committee set forth on
Section 7.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Continuing Employees employment is terminated prior to the
applicable payment date under the applicable annual cash incentive plan, such
employees annual bonus shall be paid based on actual performance as of the
date of such employees termination of employment in a lump sum cash payment
upon such employees termination.

 

Section 7.02. No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in Section
7.01 are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and the Company. Without
limiting the generality of Section 11.08, nothing in this Article 7, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, including
any current or former employees or any Continuing Employee, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, and no provision of this Article 7 (other than Section 7.01(d))
shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Employee
Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyer
or its Affiliates or limit the right of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any Employee Plan after the
Closing. Nothing in this Article 7 shall create any obligation on the part of
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, to continue to employ any Continuing
Employee for any period of time following the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 9

Survival; Indemnification

Section 9.01. Survival

 

All representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or
in connection herewith shall expire and terminate upon the Final Indemnity
Escrow Release Date, except for the Company Fundamental Warranties, Holder
Fundamental Warranties and the Buyer Fundamental Warranties, each of which
shall expire and terminate on the three-year anniversary following the
Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered

 



68  pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing until
the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date; _provided_ that the covenants which
by their terms are to be performed by the parties following Closing shall
survive the Closing indefinitely or for the shorter period explicitly
specified therein. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, (A) any
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at
which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if
notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of
indemnity shall have been given in accordance with Section 9.04 or Section
9.05, as applicable, to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought
prior to such time, (B) all representations and warranties of any Holder set
forth in Section 10(c) (Ownership) of any Letter of Transmittal shall survive
indefinitely, and (C) any claim for fraud shall survive indefinitely.

Section 9.02. Indemnification by the Holders.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9, from and after the
Effective Time, each Holder, severally but not jointly, in proportion to such
Holders Indemnity Percentage, hereby agrees to indemnify Buyer, its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries), and their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees, partners, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Persons") against, and to hold each of them harmless from any and
all damages, losses, costs and expenses ((x) including reasonable expenses of
investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection with
any Claim, but (y) excluding (A) punitive, exemplary or other similar damages
and (B) any consequential damages to the extent that such damages were not
reasonably foreseeable (other than, in each case in this clause (y), any such
damages or losses actually paid to a third party in respect of a Third-Party
Claim)) (collectively, "Damages") to the extent arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by the Company or a
Holder in this Agreement (or any inaccuracy in the certificate required
pursuant to Section 8.02(e)) or any Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ that,
with respect to a breach by a Holder of a Holder Fundamental Warranty, such
Holder shall be liable for the full amount of any Damages attributable to
such breach and any amount payable from the Indemnity Escrow Account in
respect thereof shall be deducted from such Holders Remaining Possible
Consideration;

 

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the
Company or any Holder pursuant to this Agreement or any Letter of
Transmittal; _provided_ that, with respect to a breach by a Holder of a
covenant or agreement in such Holders Letter of Transmittal, such Holder
shall be liable for the full amount of any Damages attributable to such breach
and any amount payable from the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect thereof
shall be deducted from such Holders Remaining Possible Consideration;

 

(iii) any Indemnifiable Taxes; or

 

(iv) any Stockholder Claims.

 



69 (b) With respect to indemnification by the Holders pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(i), other than in respect of any breach of a Company Fundamental
Warranty or a Holder Fundamental Warranty or in the event of fraud, (i) the
Holders shall not be liable for any individual matter or series of related
matters unless the Damages with respect thereto exceed $25,000 (the "De
Minimis Amount"), (ii) the Holders shall not be liable for any Damages in
respect of any matter unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages
with respect thereto (disregarding any Damages for which the Holders are not
liable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i)) exceeds $1,000,000 (the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent of such excess and (iii) the
Holders maximum aggregate liability shall be limited to the Indemnity Escrow
Amount (the "Cap").

__(c) With respect to indemnification by the Holders for all matters pursuant
to Section 9.02(a), Buyer hereby agrees that the sole recourse of Buyer
Indemnified Persons in respect of all such matters shall be the right to seek
payment from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
have no right to seek payment directly from the Holders in respect of any such
matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the remedies available to any party hereto (A) for any breaches of Company
Fundamental Warranties or Holder Fundamental Warranties or any breach of
covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the Company or any Holder
pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or (B) for fraud. Except for
breaches involving fraud (in which case, the liability of the Holders shall be
uncapped), in no event shall the aggregate amount for which any Holder shall
be liable to all Buyer Indemnified Persons under this Agreement exceed the
amount actually received by such Holder hereunder. __

 

 __(d) To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 for any Damages, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be required to first pursue such claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Account, and, to the extent there are sufficient funds
available in the Indemnity Escrow Account to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for the full amount of the indemnifiable portion of such Damages, any
dispute with respect to such claim related to such Damages shall be resolved
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement prior to any such Buyer
Indemnified Persons seeking payment directly from any Holders with respect to
such Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there are insufficient funds
available in the Indemnity Escrow Account to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for the full amount of the indemnifiable portion of such Damages,
such Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be permitted to seek indemnification
directly from the relevant Holder(s) to the extent of any shortfall, subject
to the limitations set forth in this Article 9. __

 

(e) With respect to indemnification by the Holders pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(i) for breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.17, Holders shall be liable for Damages only with respect to Taxes
incurred in Pre-Closing Tax Periods. For this purpose, in the case of any
Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) that

 



70  are payable for a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Taxes incurred in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than gross
receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be
deemed to equal the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such
Straddle Period that ends on and includes the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income and any gross
receipts, sales or use Tax, shall equal the portion of such Tax that
would have been payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation
set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Company.

Section 9.03. Indemnification by Buyer

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9, from and after the
Effective Time, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify the Holders and their
Affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, partners, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Holder Indemnified Persons")
against, and to hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages to the
extent arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer or Merger Sub in this Agreement (or any inaccuracy in the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iii)(A)); or

 

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to indemnification by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.03(a),
other than in respect of any breach of a Buyer Fundamental Warranty, any
breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement or in the event of fraud, (i) Buyer shall not be
liable for any individual matter or series of related matters unless
the Damages with respect thereto exceed the De Minimis Amount, (ii) Buyer
shall not be liable for any Damages in respect of any matter unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Damages with respect thereto (disregarding any
Damages for which the Holders are not liable pursuant to the foregoing clause
(i)) exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess and
(iii) the Buyers maximum aggregate liability shall be limited to the Cap. For
avoidance of doubt, the rights of Holders and their Affiliates with respect
to Damages arising under Section 9.03(a)(ii) shall not be affected by the fact
that such Damages constitute Indemnifiable Taxes resulting from a breach of
Section 6.01(d).

 

Section 9.04. Third-Party Claim Procedures

 

(a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a)
(the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the
party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third party (a 

 



71  "Third-Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such
Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances of such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification in
respect thereof (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.04, have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party as
soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within 45 days of receipt of
notice of such Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.04(a), to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so elect to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the sole
right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party and shall not constitute indemnifiable
Damages hereunder unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, or (ii)
the representation of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party
by the same counsel would present such counsel with a conflict of interest
under applicable standards of professional conduct.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.04, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim, if the settlement (A) does not release the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-
Party Claim, (B) imposes injunctive, equitable relief or any obligation on the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates other than solely the payment of
money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be fully indemnified
hereunder, (C) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing or violation of
Applicable Laws by the Indemnified Party or (D) encumbers the assets of the
Indemnified Party or imposes any restriction or condition that would apply to
or adversely affect the Indemnified Party or (E) reasonably could be expected
to affect the Taxes of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates for a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice
and at its own expense for such purpose. The Indemnified Party shall not
settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

 



72 (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, and shall furnish or cause
to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 9.05. Direct Claim Procedures

 

In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.03 against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve
a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of such Direct
Claim and the basis for indemnification in respect thereof (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure
of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent
such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 9.06. Escrow Procedures

 

The parties hereto agree that their respective rights and obligations with
respect to the Indemnity Escrow Account, including the funding of the
requisite amounts into the Indemnity Escrow Account, the procedure for the
making of claims against the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account and the
release of such amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Account, shall be governed
by, and subject to the terms and provisions of, this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

Section 9.07. Calculation of Damages

 

(a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 9.02(a) or Section
9.03(a), as applicable, by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i)
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or pursuant to contractual indemnities from any other Person alleged
to be responsible therefor and (ii) Tax benefit arising from the incurrence
or payment of such Damages actually realized by the Indemnified Party (in
cash or as a reduction in Taxes otherwise due in the same 24 month period as
such incurrence or payment). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or pursuant to contractual indemnities
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, after the
Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment in respect of such
Damages, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 



73 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein, and the right of the applicable
Indemnified Party to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives), or by
reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty or covenant
(as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule) is, was or might be
inaccurate or by reason of any waiver by such Indemnified Party of any
condition set forth in Article 8.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 9.02(a) or
Section 9.03(a), as applicable, for any Damages relating to any matter to the
extent that (i) the Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for such
Damages pursuant to the purchase price adjustment under Section 2.14 or (ii)
the Indemnified Party has recovered for such Damages under another provision
of this Agreement. In addition, in determining the amount of Damages, due
regard shall be given to items identified in, and either accrued or reserved
for in, the Financial Statements (or disclosed in the notes thereto).

(d) For purposes of this Article 9 (including for purposes of (i) determining
whether or not there has been a breach of a representation or warranty by the
Company, any Holder or Buyer and (ii) calculating the amount of Damages
incurred arising out of or relating to any such breach), all representations,
warranties and covenants contained herein shall be construed as if the word
"material" and any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" (and variations
thereof) were omitted from such representation, warranty or covenant, as the
case may be.

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages for which such Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under this Agreement, including taking any commercially
reasonable actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party for such
purpose, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any Damages to the extent arising from or aggravated by such Indemnified
Partys failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Damages. No Indemnified Party shall be required to take or omit to take any
action to mitigate under this Section 9.07(d) if the taking or omission of
such action would be detrimental in any material respect to such Indemnified
Party or would disrupt the ongoing business operations of the Indemnified
Party. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of such Damages, the Indemnified Party must notify
the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the
value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the
Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of mitigation) promptly after the benefit
is received. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any costs to the Indemnified
Party in connection with any mitigation undertaken pursuant to this Section
9.07(e) shall be deemed Damages of the Indemnified Party, (ii) such efforts to
mitigate shall not include an obligation to litigate or initiate any action
or pursue indemnification and (iii) if mitigation first requires expenditure
of funds, then the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to seek such
mitigation unless the Indemnifying Party advances such funds.

 



74 (f) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any proceeds available under applicable insurance policies, or from
any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under
Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a), as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt,
the relevant Indemnified Party shall be obligated to pursue the recovery of
insurance proceeds only if such pursuit is reasonable, taking into account the
effort necessary to pursue such recovery and any adverse consequences
resulting, or reasonably expected to result, from such pursuit to such party.

Section 9.08. Exclusive Remedy

 

This Article 9 shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the Closing for
recovery of Damages by Indemnified Parties in connection with any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the rights or remedies of Buyer or any other Indemnified
Party (a) in connection with fraud, (b) with respect to specific performance,
injunctive and other equitable relief or (c) pursuant to Article 12 hereof.

 

Section 9.09. Purchase Price Adjustment

 

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any amount paid under this Article
9 shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Aggregate
Purchase Price. Any amount payable by Buyer to the Holders under this Article
9 shall be paid to the Holders in proportion to each such Holders Indemnity
Percentage.

 

Section 9.10. Holders Representative

 

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the vote of the Stockholders approving and
adopting this Agreement and the Merger (including pursuant to the Written
Consent) and in respect of the other Holders by virtue of approval of the
Merger pursuant to any Letter of Transmittal or other receipt of consideration
in respect of the Merger, and without any further act of any of the Holders,
the Holders Representative shall be hereby appointed as the representative
of the Holders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each
such Holder for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and will
take such actions to be taken by the Holders Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and such other actions on behalf of such
Holders as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including (i)
taking all actions and making all filings on behalf of such Holders with any
Governmental Authority or other Person necessary to effect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii)
agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of,
complying with orders of courts with respect to, and otherwise administering
and handling any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of such Holders, including indemnifications claims, (iii) negotiating
and executing any waivers or amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement (provided that any amendment that shall adversely
and disproportionately affect the rights or obligations of any Holder shall
require the prior written consent of such Holder)

 



75  and (iv) taking all other actions that are either necessary or appropriate
in its judgment for the accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Holders Representative
hereby accepts such appointment. The Holders Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts based on contact information available to the
Holders Representative to keep the Holders reasonably informed with respect
to actions of the Holders Representative pursuant to the authority granted
the Holders Representative under this Agreement which actions have a material
impact on the amounts payable to the Holders. Each Holder shall promptly
provide written notice to the Holders Representative of any change of address
of such Holder.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders Representative (or
any one of them, if the Holders Representative shall be comprised of more
than one Person) hereunder shall constitute a decision, act, consent or
instruction of all Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such Holders, and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders Representative (or
any one of them, if the Holders Representative shall be comprised of more
than one Person) as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
and every such Holder. The Escrow Agent and Buyer shall be relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders Representative (or any
one of them, if the Holders Representative shall be comprised of more than
one Person).

(c) The Holders Representative shall have the right to recover from, at its
sole discretion, the Holders Representative Expense Fund Account, the
Holders Representative Expense Fund Property or any disbursements to be made
to the Holders from the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, prior to any
distribution to the Holders, (i) Holders Representatives reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in serving in that capacity and (ii) any amounts to
which it is entitled pursuant to the indemnification provision in Section
9.10(e) (each item in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.10(c) referred to
as a "Charge", and collectively the "Charges"). In the event the Indemnity
Escrow Account funds so distributed, the Holders Representative Expense Fund
Account and the Holders Representative Expense Fund Property (collectively,
the "Escrow Property") is insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then the
Holders (including the Holders Representative itself) will be obligated to
pay the Charges in excess of the Escrow Property _pro rata_ , based on their
relative Indemnity Percentages.

 

(d) The Holders Representative will incur no liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such Holders
Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and
shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for
any other action or inaction, except its own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. In all questions arising under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, the Holders Representative may rely on the advice of
outside counsel, and the Holders Representative will not be liable to any
Holder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Holders
Representative based on such advice.

 



76 (e) The Holders shall severally (each based on its Indemnity Percentage) but
not jointly indemnify the Holders Representative and hold the Holders
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, on the part of the
Holders Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Holders Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Holders Representative.

 

(f) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of Holders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as
the Holders Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written
consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of
Holders of a majority-in-interest of those Holders must be delivered to
Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less than ten days prior to
such appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the
date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Buyer
and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. For the purposes of this Section 9.10,
a "majority-in-interest of the Holders" shall mean Holders representing in the
aggregate over 50% of the percentage interests in the Escrow Property.

 

(g) In the event that the Holders Representative becomes unable or unwilling
to continue in its capacity as Holders Representative, or if the Holders
Representative resigns as a Holders Representative, a majority-in-interest of
the Holders shall use its reasonable best efforts, by written consent, to
appoint a new representative as the Holders Representative. Notice and a
copy of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of the Holders of a majority-in-interest of the Holders must be
delivered to Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will
be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date
such consent is received by Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent.

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Buyer;

 

(b) by the Company, if Buyer has breached in any material respect any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in

in Article 8 to be satisfied, which breach has not been cured within 20
Business Days after the giving of written notice by the Company to Buyer
specifying such breach;  _provided_ that the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b) only if the Company is not in
breach in any material respect of any of its obligations hereunder;

representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made by it contained in

Business Days after the giving of written notice by Buyer to the Company
specifying such breach; _provided_ that Buyer may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.01(c) only if Buyer is not in breach in any

shall not have been consummated on or before January 31, 2015 (or if such day
is not a Business Day, the next Business Day) (the "Outside Date"); _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(d)
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

 

(e) by either the Company, the Holders Representative or Buyer if

termination shall be effective as against all parties hereto and shall be
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
parties to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result
from the willful failure (a) of a party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or (b) of a party to perform
a covenant under this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and
all losses, costs and liabilities of any kind, character or description
incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure or
breach. The provisions of this Section 10.02 and of Section 5.04, Section
5.09, Section 9.10 and Articles 11 and 12 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 10.01. __

party against whom the waiver is to be effective (with the Holders
Representative being authorized to act on behalf of the Holders).

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.03. Expenses

 

Except as otherwise provided herein (including, for the sake of clarity, with
respect to the Company Transaction Expenses, which shall be borne by the
Holders as a deduct from the calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price), all

benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its

Section 11.08. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries

 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and

other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no
effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the

Representative to pursue claims (on behalf of all of the Holders) for monetary

right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Buyer and Merger Sub,
(ii) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of the Holders Representative
to pursue claims (on behalf of all of the Holders) for damages incurred or
suffered by such Holders, subject to Section 10.02, for any breach of this
Agreement by Buyer or Merger Sub, whether or not this Agreement has been
validly terminated, which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by

with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of any party hereto shall have any liability for

contemplated hereby.

 



82 Section 11.10. Entire Agreement

 

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
oral and written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

 

Section 11.11. Severability

 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.12. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege

 

(a) Each of Buyer and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries)
covenants and agrees that, following the Closing, Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
or any other internal or external legal counsel currently representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Prior Company Counsel") may serve
as counsel to the Holders, the Holders Representative and their respective
Affiliates in connection with any matters arising under or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including with
respect to any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
notwithstanding any representation by the Prior Company Counsel prior to the
Closing Date of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby irrevocably (i) waive any
claim they have or may have that a Prior Company Counsel has a conflict of
interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and
(ii) covenant and agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any Holder(s), the Holders Representative and/or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Prior Company Counsel may represent
any Holder, the Holders Representative and/or any of their respective
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be
directly adverse to Buyer or the Acquired Companies and even though Prior
Company Counsel may have represented the Acquired Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

 



83 (b) All communications between any Holder(s), the Holders Representative,
the Company of any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior
Company Counsel, on the other hand, related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to the Holders, the Holders Representative and their
respective Affiliates (excluding, for the sake of clarity, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (the "Holder Pre-Closing Transaction Related Communications").
Accordingly, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their directors, officers, advisors or other representatives shall have access
to any such Holder Pre-Closing Transaction Related Communications or to the
files of Prior Company Counsel relating to such engagement from and after the
Closing, and all books, records and other materials of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries in any medium (including electronic copies) containing or
reflecting any of the Holder Pre-Closing Transaction Related Communications
or the work product of legal counsel with respect thereto, including any
related summaries, drafts or analyses, and all rights with respect to any of
the foregoing, are hereby assigned and transferred to the Holders and the
Holders Representative effective as of the Closing (collectively, the "Holder
Privileged Materials"). The Holder Privileged Materials shall be excluded from
the transfer contemplated by this Agreement and shall be distributed to the
Holders Representative (on behalf of itself and the Holders) immediately
prior to Closing with no copies thereof retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective representatives.
From and after the Closing, Buyer, its Affiliates and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives shall maintain the
confidentiality of the Holder Privileged Materials. From and after the
Closing, none of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and their respective representatives shall access or in any way,
directly or indirectly, use or rely upon any Holder Privileged Materials. To
the extent that any Holder Privileged Materials are not delivered to the
Holders Representative (on behalf of itself and the Holders), the Company
agrees (on behalf of its self and its Subsidiaries) not to assert a waiver of
any applicable privilege or protection, and will deliver all such Holder
Privileged Materials to the Holders Representative (on behalf of itself and
the Holders) promptly upon discovery thereof, without retaining copies
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, (a) the Holders and the Holders Representative in such capacities
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
Holder Privileged Materials, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Prior Company Counsel in respect of Holder Privileged Materials constitute
property of the client, only the Holders and the Holders Representative shall
hold such property rights and (c) Prior Company Counsel shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Holder Privileged Materials to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Prior Company Counsel and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise. Each of Buyer and the Company hereby acknowledges
and confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and obtain adequate
information regarding the significance and risks of the waivers and other
terms and conditions of this Section 11.12, including the opportunity to
discuss with counsel such matters and reasonable alternatives to such terms.
This Section 11.12 is for the benefit of Holders, the Holders
Representative, their respective Affiliates, each of which is an intended
third party beneficiary of this Section 11.12. The covenants and obligations
set forth in this Section 11.12 shall survive for 10 years following the
Closing Date.

 



84 Section 11.13. Company Disclosure Schedule

 

(a) In respect of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the parties agree that

 

(i) any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in this Agreement,
but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or covenants)
would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference
and such representations and warranties (or covenants); and

 

(iii) (i) the Company Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer,
and (ii) the disclosure by the Company of any matter in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company
that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is material.

Section 11.14. Specific Performance

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in the courts provided in Section 11.06, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) any defense to any action for specific
performance hereunder based on the claim that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The pursuit of specific
enforcement by any party hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in
equity) to which such party may be entitled (including monetary damages), and
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party.

ARTICLE 12

 

Guarantee

Section 12.01. Guarantor Representations

Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows: Guarantor
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and

 



85  perform its obligations under this Article 12. The execution and delivery by
Guarantor of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations under this
Article 12 have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of
Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The execution, delivery and performance by
Guarantor of this Article 12 do not and will not (a) conflict with or violate
the organizational documents of Guarantor, (b) require the consent of
any Person or (c) conflict with or violate, in any material respect, any
Applicable Law.

Section 12.02. Guarantee. Subject to the provisions of this Section 12.02,
Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Company the due and punctual payment of (i) any and all amounts payable by
Buyer pursuant to Article 2 or Article 9 or (ii) in the event Closing does
not occur, any monetary obligation of Buyer to the Company resulting from such
failure to close (together with clause (i) immediately above, the "Guaranteed
Obligation"). Guarantor hereby acknowledges that this guaranty of the
Guaranteed Obligation shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and not
of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of
any remedies against Buyer. Guarantor agrees that (A) if Buyer fails to make
any payments of the Guaranteed Obligations when due, such amount shall for
purposes hereof, be immediately due and payable by Guarantor by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
the Company upon written notice from the Company to Guarantor demanding
payment thereof and (B) the Company may at any time and from time to time, so
long as Buyer has failed to pay the Guaranteed Obligation if due, take any and
all actions available hereunder or under Applicable Law to collect the
Guaranteed Obligation from Guarantor. Guarantor hereby waives diligence,
demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of a merger or
bankruptcy of Buyer, any right to require a proceeding first against Buyer,
the benefit of discussion, protest or notice and all demands whatsoever, and
covenants that this guaranty will not be discharged as to any obligation
except by satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligation in full. Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter
acquire against Buyer that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of its obligations under this guaranty and this Agreement,
including any right of reimbursement, exoneration, contribution,
indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Company against Buyer or any collateral which the Company hereafter acquires,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under
contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from
Parent, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in
any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other
rights. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of a party to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, (b) any rescission,
waiver, amendment or

 



86  modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement or the invalidity or unenforceability (in whole or in part) of this
Agreement, unless consented to in writing by the Company and (c) any change
in the existence (corporate or otherwise) of Buyer or Guarantor or any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting any of
them or their assets. Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and
indirect benefits from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that the waivers set forth in this Section 12.02 are knowingly made
in contemplation of such benefits.
