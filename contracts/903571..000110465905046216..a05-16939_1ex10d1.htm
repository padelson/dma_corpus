Dear Sirs:

  



       

**RE:**

**Proposed Business  Combination between Golden Star Resources Ltd. and St.
Jude Resources Ltd.**

    
---|--- 
   



  



  

This letter agreement (the " **Agreement** ") sets forth the terms and
conditions under which Golden Star Resources Ltd. (" **Golden Star** ") and
St. Jude Resources Ltd. (" **St. Jude** ") will complete a business
combination (the " **Business Combination** ") whereby Golden Star will
acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of St. Jude (" **St.
Jude Common Shares** ") and other securities of St. Jude, subject to the
terms and conditions herein contained. For the purpose hereof, St. Jude and
Golden Star are collectively referred to as the " **Parties** " and
individually as a " **Party** " and " **Material Adverse Effect** " means,
in respect of a Party, any change, effect, event or occurrence which is
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, affairs, properties, assets, liabilities, capitalization, results
of operations, operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Party and its subsidiaries (individually a " **Subsidiary** " and
collectively, the " **Subsidiaries** ") taken as a whole, other than any
change, effect, event or occurrence relating to: (i) the global economy or
securities markets in general; (ii) the price of gold; (iii) the rate at
which Canadian dollars or United States dollars can be changed for
any foreign currency; (iv) the gold mining industry in general and
not specifically relating to or affecting such Party; (v) the
general political and business climate related to carrying on business in
Ghana; and (vi) any change in the trading price of the securities of a Party
immediately following and reasonably attributable to the disclosure of the
Business Combination.

  



  

 **1.** ** THE BUSINESS COMBINATION**

  



  

 **1.1** ** Basis of the Business Combination**

  



  

The Parties intend to proceed with a court sanctioned plan of arrangement of
St. Jude effected pursuant to the _Canada Business Corporations Act_ whereby
Golden Star will directly or indirectly acquire all of the issued and
outstanding St. Jude Common Shares (and other securities of St. Jude)
following which St. Jude will become a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Golden Star. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ultimate form
of Business Combination will be mutually determined by Golden Star and St.
Jude, each acting reasonably, based on tax, securities and corporate law and
other considerations. The Parties intend that the Business Combination will
be completed by December 16, 2005 (the " **Effective Date** "). Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties shall complete the
Business Combination on the following terms: (a) the holders of St. Jude
Common Shares will exchange their St. Jude Common Shares for common shares of
Golden Star (the " **Golden Star Common Shares** ") on the basis of 0.72
Golden Star Common Shares for each one St. Jude Common Share; and (b) the
outstanding warrants and options of St. Jude (the " **St. Jude Convertible
Securities** ") **** shall be exchanged for Golden Star warrants or options,
such that each holder will be entitled to receive

  

   

     
   

  



  

on the exercise thereof that number of Golden Star Common Shares that is
equal to (w) the number of St. Jude Common Shares that would otherwise have
been issuable upon the exercise thereof multiplied by (x) 0.72, with the
exercise price thereof being adjusted to be the number that is equal to (y)
the exercise price of the applicable St. Jude Convertible Security divided by
(z) 0.72, provided that such options and warrants shall not expire prior to
the date on which the respective St. Jude Convertible Securities were to
expire pursuant to their respective terms or, in the event of St.
Jude options that would otherwise expire on the completion of the Business
Combination as a result of a holder thereof ceasing to be an employee,
officer or director concurrent with the completion of the Business
Combination, subject to receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals and
provided that no majority of the minority St. Jude securityholder approval is
required, the expiry date of such options will be extended to the date that
is 90 days after the date of completion of the Business Combination.

  



  

 **1.2** ** Structure Subsequent to the Business Combination**

  



  

In conjunction with the completion of the Business Combination:

  



  

(a) the number of directors of Golden Star shall be increased to seven (7).
All of the current directors of Golden Star shall remain directors of Golden
Star and St. Jude shall be entitled to nominate one nominee (who shall be the
Chief Executive Officer of St. Jude) to the board of directors of Golden Star
and, subject to any applicable legal requirements, Golden Star shall propose
the Chief Executive Officer of St. Jude as a director to its shareholders at
its next annual general meeting and shall solicit proxies in favour of his
election to the board of directors at such meeting;

  



  

(b) Golden Star shall determine: (i) which personnel of St. Jude will be
appointed or retained upon the completion of the Business Combination; and
(ii) which offices and personnel of St. Jude in West Africa will be
maintained or retained subsequent to the Business Combination;

  



  

(c) subject to clause (b) above, St. Jude shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause all directors and officers of St. Jude who will not be retained to
resign and sign releases in favour of St. Jude concurrently with the
completion of the Business Combination; and

  



  

(d) the existing office of St. Jude in Vancouver, British Columbia will be
phased out during the remainder of the existing lease.

  



  

 **1.3** ** Definitive Agreement**

  



  

The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith and use best efforts to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for the Business Combination consistent
with the terms hereof (the " **Definitive Agreement** ") as soon as
practicable and, in any event, on or before October 17, 2005, which shall be
in form and substance satisfactory to Golden Star and St. Jude and will
contain, in addition to the provisions of this Agreement, other
terms, conditions, representations and warranties, covenants,
indemnifications and closing conditions that are customary for a transaction
of this nature.

hereby and have unanimously determined that the Arrangement is fair to the
holders of St. Jude Common Shares (the " **St. Jude Shareholders** ") and is
in the best interests of St. Jude, and have unanimously resolved to recommend
that the St. Jude Shareholders vote in favour of the Business Combination,

represent in the St. Jude information circular related to an St. Jude Meeting

3   

     
   

  



  

(h) the board of directors of St. Jude has received on or before the date
hereof advice from St. Judes financial advisors indicating that the share

directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, advisor,
representative or agent, (a) solicit, initiate, facilitate, engage in or
respond to or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) any
inquiries, proposals or transactions involving St. Jude and/or its
Subsidiaries regarding any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, restructuring,
take-over bid, tender offer, exchange offer, sale or purchase of substantial
assets, sale or purchase of treasury shares, any equity interest or rights or
any other interests therein or thereto, business combinations, liquidations,
reorganizations or recapitalizations or similar transactions or series of

foregoing (any of the foregoing inquiries, proposals or transactions being
referred to as an " **Acquisition Proposal** "); (b) encourage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal; (c)
accept, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (d) cause St. Jude
or any Subsidiary to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
related to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the board of directors of St. Jude
which receives an unsolicited and _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the
date hereof in respect of it, from considering, negotiating, approving or
recommending to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal which the board of
directors of St. Jude determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors and after receiving written advice from counsel
(copies of which shall forthwith be provided to Golden Star) that such action
would be a proper exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable laws,
would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction:
(i) more favourable to its shareholders than the Business Combination (as it
may be amended pursuant to Section 3.4); (ii) having consideration with a
value per St. Jude Common Share greater than the value per St. Jude Common
Share provided by the Business Combination (as it may be amended pursuant to
Section 3.4); (iii) reasonably capable of being completed within a reasonable
period of time; and (iv) which is not contingent upon financing (any such
Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a " **Superior Proposal** ").

  



  

3.3.2 From and after the date hereof, St. Jude shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated in writing any existing discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than Golden Star) with respect to any potential
Acquisition Proposal and shall, subject to Section 3.3.4, cease to provide
any other person with access to information concerning St. Jude and its
Subsidiaries and exercise all rights it has to require the return of all
confidential information. St. Jude agrees not to release or permit
the release of any person from, or waive, any confidentiality, non-
solicitation or standstill agreement to which such person is a party, unless
the board of directors of St. Jude has determined that such person has made a
Superior Proposal.

  



  

3.3.3 St. Jude shall promptly notify Golden Star orally and in writing within
24 hours of any Acquisition Proposal or any amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal being received directly or indirectly by St. Jude, or any request
for non-public information relating to St. Jude or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, in connection with such an Acquisition Proposal or for
access to the properties, books and/or records of St. Jude or any Subsidiary,
by any person that informs St. Jude or such Subsidiary that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such written notice shall
include a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal and all amendments thereto
or, in the absence of a written Acquisition Proposal, a description of the
material terms and conditions thereof, in either case including the identity
of the person making the Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

3.3.4 If St. Jude receives a request for non-public information from a person
who has made or intends to make an Acquisition Proposal and the board of
directors of St. Jude determines in good faith after consultation with
financial and legal advisors **** that such Acquisition Proposal is, or if
made would be, a Superior Proposal, then, and only in such case, St. Jude
may, subject to the execution by such person of a confidentiality agreement
containing standstill and other provisions substantially the same as those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 7.3), ****
provide such person with access to non-public confidential information
regarding St. Jude; provided that St. Jude shall send a copy of any such
confidentiality agreement (including the identity of the person who
has entered into such agreement) to Golden Star as soon as practicable and in
any event within 24 hours of its execution and shall, as soon as practicable
and in any event within 24 hours, provide Golden Star with a list and copies
of all information provided to such person that was not previously provided
to Golden Star and immediately provide Golden Star with all other information
that was provided to such person.

  



  

3.3.5 St. Jude shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and
those of its Subsidiaries and any financial, legal and other advisors, agents
and representatives retained by St. Jude are aware of the provisions of this
Section 3.3, and St. Jude shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
by such persons. For greater certainty, any amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this
Section 3.3.

  



  

 **3.4** ** ****Notice of Superior Proposal Determination**

  



  

3.4.1 If St. Jude has fully complied with Section 3.3 and this Section 3.4,
St. Jude may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal and
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Golden Star its recommendation of
the approval of the Business Combination, if and only if it:

  



  

(a) provides to Golden Star: (i) written notice that the board of directors
of St. Jude has determined that it has received and is prepared to accept a
Superior Proposal; (ii) a copy of any agreement or other document in respect
of such Superior Proposal as executed by the person making the Superior
Proposal, in each case as soon as possible but in any event not less than
five full business days prior to acceptance of the Superior Proposal by the
board of directors of St. Jude; and (iii) in the case of an Acquisition
Proposal that includes non-cash consideration, the value or range of values
attributed by the board of directors of St. Jude, in good faith, for such
non-cash consideration after consultation with its financial advisors;

  



  

(b) provides Golden Star with an opportunity (but not the obligation), during
the five business day period referred to in Subsection 3.4.1(a) to propose
to amend this Agreement to provide for consideration having a value
equivalent to or more favourable to the St. Jude Shareholders than that of
the Superior Proposal with the result that the Superior Proposal would cease
to be a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(c) subject to Subsection 3.4.2, terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Subsection 6.1(d) and pays to Golden Star the St. Jude Break Fee (as defined
below in Subsection 5.1) as contemplated by Section 5.2.

  



  

3.4.2 In the event that Golden Star agrees to amend this Agreement in the
manner described in Subsection 3.4.1, the board of directors of St. Jude
shall consider the terms of the proposed amendment, and: (i) if the board of
directors of St. Jude concludes the Superior Proposal is no longer a Superior
Proposal given the terms of the proposed amendment, St. Jude shall not
implement the proposed Superior Proposal and shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Subsection 6.1(d), and shall agree to the
proposed amendments to this Agreement; or (ii) if the board of directors of
St. Jude concludes that the Acquisition Proposal would nonetheless remain
a Superior Proposal, St. Jude shall terminate this

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

Agreement in accordance with Subsection 6.1(d) and concurrently pay to Golden
Star the St. Jude Break Fee in accordance with Section 5.2, and only
thereafter St. Jude may enter into an agreement in order to implement the
Superior Proposal.

  



  

 **3.5** ** ****Access to Information**

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable
laws, upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford the other Partys officers, employees and advisors
access, during normal business hours from the date hereof and until the
earlier of the execution of the Definitive Agreement and the termination of
this Agreement, to its properties, books, contracts and records as well as to
its management personnel, and all material information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request.
In addition, after the execution of the Definitive Agreement and until the
Effective Time: (i) St. Jude shall provide to Golden Star reports of its
activities including, but not limited to monthly operating reports and
monthly financial reports, as well as full and open access on a real time
basis to its offices, books and records; and (ii) Golden Star will provide to
St. Jude a copy of the monthly operating report that it provides to Golden
Stars board of directors.

  



  

 **3.6** ** ****Covenants in Respect of the Business** **Combination**

  



  

Each Party covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement, until the earlier of the Effective Date and the date upon
which this Agreement is terminated, it will:

to enable it to participate in and effect the Business Combination (including

Securities, voting as single class, for the purpose of considering the
Business Combination in compliance with applicable laws as soon as reasonably
practicable and no later than December 7, 2005 or such later date (but in any
case, on or before March 16, 2006) as the Parties, acting reasonably, may
agree to in writing; and (iv) in the case of St. Jude, prepare in
consultation and co-operation with Golden Star and in compliance with

 **5.** ** BREAK FEES AND EXPENSES**

  



  

 **5.1** ** Interpretation**

  



  

For the purposes of this Section 5:

  



  

" **St. Jude Break Fee** " shall mean a fee of CDN$4,000,000.

  



  

" **St. Jude** **Fee Event** " shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:

  



  

(a) the termination of this Agreement by Golden Star pursuant to Subsection
6.1(b)(i) (only in the case of a breach by St. Jude of any provision of
Sections 3.2(d), 3.3 or 3.4, but excluding any immaterial breach of a
provision of Section 3.3 which would not have a material impact on the timing
or likelihood of completing the Business Combination) or Subsection 6.1(e);

  



  

(b) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Subsection 6.1(d); or

  



  

(c) if all of the following occur: (i) an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made to St. Jude or made known to the St. Jude Shareholders generally or
shall have been made directly to St. Jude Shareholders or any person shall
have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal in
respect of St. Jude; (ii) this Agreement is terminated; and (iii) St. Jude
completes any Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement or
within 12 months following the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

 **5.2** ** St. Jude Break Fee**

  



  

St. Jude shall pay to Golden Star the St. Jude Break Fee in immediately
available funds no later than one business day after the first to occur of
any St. Jude Fee Event or, in the event of the St. Jude Fee Event set out in
subparagraph (c) of the definition of St. Jude Fee Event, no later than one
business day following completion of the Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

 **5.3** ** Expense Reimbursement**

  



  

(a) If the Agreement is terminated by Golden Star pursuant to Subsection
6.1(b)(i) (other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Subsection
6.1(b)(i) which would constitute a St. Jude Fee Event, in which case St. Jude
shall pay Golden Star the St. Jude Break Fee in accordance with

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

Section 5.2), St. Jude shall forthwith pay to Golden Star within one (1)

available funds.

  



  

 **5.4** ** Liquidated Damages**

  



  

(a) St. Jude acknowledges that the payment amount set out in Section 5.2 is
a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages which Golden Star will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement
and is not a penalty. St. Jude hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages
are excessive or punitive.

  



  

(b) Each Party acknowledges that the payment amount set out in Section 5.3 is
a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages which the other Party will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement
and is not a penalty, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated
damages are excessive or punitive. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Subsection 5.4(b) to the contrary, payment by one Party to the other Party
pursuant to Section 5.3 shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other
payment or remedy available at law or in equity in the event of any wilful or
intentional breach by the Party making the payment of any of its obligations
or covenants under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

as the Parties, acting reasonably, may agree to in writing) or such other
time prior thereto as is specified in this Agreement,

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

provided that the terminating Party is not then in breach of any
representations, warranties and covenants herein contained in any material
respect;

  



  

(c) by Golden Star or St. Jude if any of the following have occurred:

  



  

(i) if the approval of the St. Jude Shareholders has not been obtained by

expected to facilitate it, the approval of the holders of St. Jude Common
Shares and holders of St. Jude Convertible Securities, voting as a single
class, is not obtained in accordance with applicable laws;

  



  

(d) by either Party, upon the determination by St. Jude after conclusion of
the process set out in Section 3.3 that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal, the provision of notice to Golden Star of a
Superior Proposal as required by Section 3.4 and the time period for Golden
Star to propose an amendment to the Agreement as contemplated by Section 3.4
has elapsed; or

  



  

(e) by Golden Star, if the board of directors of St. Jude (i) has withdrawn
or changed any of its recommendations to the St. Jude Shareholders in a
manner adverse to Golden Star or which would impede the completion of the
Business Combination, or has made a recommendation to the St. Jude
Shareholders not to accept or approve the Business Combination, or (ii) has
not submitted the Business Combination for approval to St. Jude Shareholders
on or prior to December 7, 2005 (or such later date (but in any case, on or
before March 16, 2006) as the Parties, acting reasonably, may agree to in
writing), provided that Golden Star has provided, on a timely basis,
information regarding Golden Star required by applicable securities laws for
inclusion in the management information circular of St. Jude to be used at
the St. Jude Meeting, or (iii) has failed to solicit proxies in favour of
approving the Business Combination, or (iv) has resolved to do any of the
foregoing.

  



  

In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Party as provided in
this Section 6, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of either Party, except with respect
to Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 7.2, and 7.3 which provisions shall survive the
termination; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, neither Party shall be (i) relieved or released from any
liability or damages arising out of any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination or (ii) precluded from seeking injunctive relief to restrain
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or otherwise to obtain
specific performance of any provision of this Agreement.
