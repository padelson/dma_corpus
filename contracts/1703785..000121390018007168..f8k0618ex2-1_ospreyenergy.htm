Units and shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock such transferee may be

entitles Royal LP to an Earn-Out Payment pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)(i)_ and
_2.6(a)(ii)_ (but only if neither of which has previously been paid), then
Royal LP shall be entitled to receive both of such Earn-Out Payments. If the
30-Day VWAP does not exceed either or both of the Tier 1 Target or the
Adjusted Tier 2 Target at any time during the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the last day of the Earn-Out Payment Period, then Buyer

the applicable Common Units shall be deemed issued and outstanding, effective
immediately prior to the consummation of such Liquidity Event and the holders
thereof shall be entitled to receive the corresponding Liquidity Event
Consideration, subject to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Following
the consummation of any Liquidity Event, Buyer shall cease to have any
further obligation under this _Section 2.6_. Any such Earn-Out Payment or
Earn-Out Payments shall not be paid or payable in the event such Liquidity
Event is not consummated and Buyer will continue to have the obligations set
forth in this _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(f)  If, prior to the termination of Buyer's obligation to make any Earn-
Out Payment, any change in the outstanding shares of Buyer Class A Common
Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, the Earn-Out Payments, the Tier
1 Target and Adjusted Tier 2 Target shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change and to provide to Royal LP the same economic effect as
contemplated by this _Section 2.6_ prior to such change.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

2.7 _  Withholding_. Buyer and the Partnership shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Contributor such amounts that Buyer or the Partnership, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law with
respect to the making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
and Partnership shall notify the Contributors of any amounts expected to be
deducted and withheld at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date and the basis for such deduction and withholding. Buyer or Partnership,
as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with the Contributors to reduce or

amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Documents of the Royal Entities the Contributors' Appointees, the
Contributors or their respective Affiliates to the extent relating to periods
prior to Closing. Buyer shall cause the Royal Entities to, effective as of
the Closing Date, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance
policies that cover the existing directors and officers of the Royal Entities
for a claims-reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and
after the Closing Date with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against any of the Contributors' Appointees by reason of

cause the Royal Entities to spend more than 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Buyer for Buyer's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Cap Amount_"); _provided further_
that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the DandO Cap Amount then the Royal
Entities shall purchase as much coverage as is obtainable for the DandO Cap
Amount which shall satisfy the obligations of Buyer and the Royal Entities
under this _Section 6.5_. From and after the Closing, in the event that Buyer
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_. Buyer shall not
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render Buyer unable to satisfy
their obligations under this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

48

 



    

  



  

6.6 _  Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Royal shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Royal Entities or with respect to the Assets of the Royal
Entities that are due on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Laws. Not later than five (5) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for filing any such Tax Return, Royal
shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation, to Buyer for its reasonable comment. Royal shall
cause such Tax Returns (as revised to incorporate Buyer's reasonable
comments) to be timely filed and will provide a copy to Buyer. No amended Tax
Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be filed by any of
the Royal Entities or with respect to any Assets of the Royal Entities without
the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(b) The Partnership shall be responsible for the payment of any Transfer
Taxes. Each Contributor, Buyer and the Partnership shall timely file its own
Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes as required by Law and shall
notify the other Parties when such filings have been made. Each Contributor,
Buyer and the Partnership shall cooperate and consult with the other Parties
prior to filing such Tax Returns (i) in order to minimize such Transfer
Taxes, and (ii) to ensure that all such Tax Returns are duly and timely
filed.

  



  

(c) The Parties shall furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to
books and records) and assistance relating to the Royal Entities or the Assets
of the Royal Entities as is reasonably requested by any Party for the filing
of any Tax Returns or for the preparation, prosecution or defense of any
Tax Proceeding. The Party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse any
applicable other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such assistance. Any information obtained under this _Section
6.6(c)_ shall be held confidential by the receiving Party in the same manner
as it holds confidential its own similar information, except (i) as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims
for refund or in conducting a Tax Proceeding or (ii) with the consent of each
applicable Party.

  



  

(d) The Parties agree that, to the extent made in exchange for Common Units,
the Buyer Contribution and the Contributors' Contributions shall be treated,
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, as contributions to the Partnership
pursuant to Section 721 of the Code. To the maximum extent permitted pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), any transfer of money or other
consideration by the Partnership to the Contributors shall not be treated as
part of a sale of property by the Contributors to the Partnership under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a) and shall be treated as a reimbursement
of preformation capital expenditures. The sum of (i) cash and other
consideration not treated as reimbursement of preformation capital
expenditures and (ii) the amount of assumed liabilities treated as a transfer
of consideration under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5 will be treated as
proceeds from the sale of property by the Contributors to the Partnership
described in Section 707 of the Code.

  



  

(e) On or before the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of the Royal
Entities pursuant to all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements (other than
this Agreement), if any, to which any of the Royal Entities, on the one hand,
and any Affiliate of Royal (other than the Royal Entities), on the other
hand, are parties, shall terminate, and neither any of the Royal Entities, on
the one hand, nor any Affiliate of Royal (other than the Royal Entities), on
the other hand, shall have any rights or obligations to each other after the
Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

  



  

   

49

 



    

  



  

(f) Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a
statement reflecting a valuation of all of the Assets of the Royal Entities
in accordance with the principles of Sections 1060 and 755 of the Code, as
applicable. The Parties shall then cooperate in good faith to prepare a final
allocation (the " _Tax Allocation Statement_ "). The Parties agree that, to
the extent required by Law, they will each properly prepare and timely file
Form 8594 in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and any statements
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1(k).

  



  

(g) None of the Parties shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates not to)
take any position (whether on any Tax Return, Tax Proceeding or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment or the Tax Allocation
Statement, except to the extent otherwise required to do so by applicable Law
or pursuant to any good faith resolution or settlement of a Tax Proceeding.

  



  

(h) The Parties shall retain, or cause to be retained, all books and records
pertinent to the Royal Entities and the Assets of the Royal Entities until
the period for assessment of Taxes under applicable Law (giving effect to any
and all extensions or waivers) has expired and such additional period as
necessary to complete any Tax Proceeding (or proposed Tax Proceeding), and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority.

  



  

(i) The Partnership shall have in effect an election under Section 754 of the
Code and any similar election under corresponding provisions of applicable
state and local tax Laws.

  



  

(j) The Parties agree that the Partnership shall use the "remedial allocation
method" as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(d) for purposes
of Section 704(c) of the Code.

  



  

6.7 _  Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) No Party shall make any public announcement or issue any public
communication regarding this Agreement or the Transactions without first
obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, except if such
announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law or the
rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's capital stock is traded,
in which case, to the extent permitted by Law, the disclosing Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate or communicate
such announcement or communication with the other Party prior to announcement
or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that no provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to restrict in any manner (i) any Party's ability to
communicate with its employees or equity holders, (ii) the ability of Buyer
and the Royal Entities to communicate with their financial and legal advisors,
lenders, underwriters or Financing Sources or (iii) any Party's ability to
make or issue any public announcement or communication that is substantially
consistent with any prior public announcement or public communication made in
accordance with this _Section 6.7(a)_.

  



  

   

50

 



    

  



  

(b)  From the Closing Date and for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing Date, Royal and each Contributor will, and will cause its respective
Affiliates and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective
Representatives to (i) maintain the strict confidentiality of any and all
Confidential Information and (ii) not disclose such Confidential Information
to any Person other than any of the respective Affiliates or Representatives
of Royal or any Contributor, except (x) to the extent required by Law
(provided that if required by Law, each party agrees, to the extent legally
permissible, to give the others prior written notice of such disclosure in
sufficient time to permit the others to seek a protective order should it so
determine) or (y) in a Proceeding brought by such party in the pursuit of its
remedies under this Agreement. Each Party shall (1) notify all Persons to
whom Confidential Information is disclosed of the confidential nature of the
materials disclosed and the provisions of this Agreement; and (2) ensure that
all Persons to whom the terms of this Agreement or the Confidential
Information is disclosed keep such information confidential and do not
disclose or divulge such information to any unauthorized Person in each case
in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _  Distributions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Contributors shall have the right to cause the Royal Entities
to pay cash dividends, and/or make cash distributions to the Contributors or
its Affiliates at any time prior to Closing.

  



  

6.9 _  The Proxy Statement and the Special Meeting_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date, but in
any event within 12 Business Days following delivery of information required
to be provided by the Royal Entities, Buyer will prepare and file with the SEC
a proxy statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14A of the
Exchange Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary form. Buyer shall as
promptly as practicable notify the Contributors and the Royal Entities of the
receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy
Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information. Buyer shall cooperate and provide the
Contributors and the Royal Entities with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement
thereto) and all responses to requests for additional information by and
replies to comments of the SEC and give due consideration to all comments
reasonably proposed by the Contributors and the Royal Entities in respect of
such documents and responses prior to filing such with or sending such to the
SEC, and the Parties will provide each other with copies of all such filings
made and correspondence with the SEC. Except in the case of a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 6.9(d)_ , the Buyer Board Recommendation
shall be included in the Proxy Statement. Buyer will use its reasonable best
efforts to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement. Buyer will cause the Proxy Statement to be
transmitted to the holders of Buyer Common Stock as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within five Business Days, following the date on which the
SEC confirms it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.

  



  

   

51

 



    

  



  

(b)  The Contributors and the Royal Entities acknowledge that a substantial
portion of the Proxy Statement shall include disclosure regarding the Royal
Entities and their management, operations and financial condition.
Accordingly, the Royal Entities will, and the Contributors will cause the
Royal Entities to, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Execution
Date, use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer with all
information concerning the operations and business of the Royal Entities
and the Royal Entities' management and operations and financial condition, in
each case, required to be included in the Proxy Statement, including the
required financial statements of the Royal Entities prepared in accordance
with Regulation S-X and a related consent from the Royal Entities'
independent public accountants. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Royal, the Contributors and the Royal Entities shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the preparation for inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro
forma financial statements that comply with the requirements of Regulation
S-X under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Royal, the Contributors and
the Royal Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make their
managers, directors, officers and employees and other Representatives
available to Buyer and its counsel in connection with the drafting of the
Proxy Statement, as reasonably requested by Buyer, and responding in a timely
manner to comments on the Proxy Statement and such other filings from the SEC;
_provided_ that doing so does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Royal Entities or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c)  Buyer will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and
the Organizational Documents of Buyer, all action necessary to call, hold and
convene a special meeting of holders of Buyer Common Stock (including any
permitted adjournment or postponement, the " _Special Meeting_ ") to consider
and vote upon the Stockholder Proposals (as defined below) as promptly as
practicable after the filing of the Proxy Statement in definitive form with
the SEC. Once the Special Meeting to consider and vote upon the Stockholder
Proposals has been called and noticed, except as required by Law, Buyer will
not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the consent of the
Contributors (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) other than (1) for the absence of a quorum, or (2) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that Buyer has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal advisors, is necessary under applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by
the holders of Buyer Common Stock prior to the Special Meeting or (3) an
adjournment or postponement to solicit additional proxies from holders of
Buyer Common Stock to the extent Buyer has determined in good faith that such
adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary to obtain the approval of
the Stockholder Proposals. Subject to _Section 6.9(d)_ , Buyer will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit approval of the Stockholder Proposals by
the holders of Buyer Common Stock.

  



  

   

52

 



    

  



  

(d)  The Buyer Board will recommend that the holders of Buyer Common Stock
approve the Stockholder Proposals (the " _Buyer Board Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the
Stockholder Proposals, the Buyer Board may withdraw, modify or qualify in any
manner the Buyer Board Recommendation (any such action a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the Buyer Board shall have concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial advisors,
that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that
the Buyer Board shall not be entitled to exercise its rights to make a Change
in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless (i) such Change in
Recommendation is based upon an Intervening Event and (ii) Buyer has provided
to the Contributors three Business Days' prior written notice advising the
Contributor that the Buyer Board intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail. Buyer agrees that, unless the
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, its obligation to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Special Meeting for the purpose of voting on the Stockholder Proposals shall
not be affected by any Change in Recommendation, and Buyer agrees to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Special Meeting and submit for the approval of its stockholders the
matters contemplated by the Proxy Statement, regardless of whether or not
there shall be any Change in Recommendation.

  



  

(e)  If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event, circumstance or
information relating to Buyer, the Contributors or the Royal Entities, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors or other Representatives
should be discovered by Buyer, the Contributors or the Royal Entities, as
applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC by Buyer
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the holders of Buyer
Common Stock;  _provided_ that no information received by Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 6.9(e)_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made hereunder by any Party,
and no such information shall be deemed to change, supplement or amend the
Schedules.

  



  

(f)  Buyer shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in
connection with the valid termination of this Agreement. Buyer shall extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC, NASDAQ or the respective staff thereof that is
applicable to the Offer. Nothing in this _Section 6.9(f)_ shall (i) impose any
obligation on Buyer to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date, or (ii) be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
Buyer to terminate this Agreement in accordance its terms.

Contributor or Royal Entity, as applicable, with respect to solvency matters)

other fee or incur any other Liability prior to Closing in connection with

their Related Persons that may arise (i) out of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Transactions, or (ii) as a result of the ownership by such
Contributor or its Related Persons of any Interests in the Partnership or any
of its Affiliates from and after the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Each of the Buyer, the Partnership and the Royal Entities hereby
waives, acquits, forever discharges and releases, effective as of the
Closing, on behalf of itself and each of its past, present and future
stockholders, partners, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and
each of their respective successors and assigns in their capacities as such
(collectively, their respective " _Buyer Related Persons_ "), to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any and all Proceedings, causes of action, damages,
judgments, liabilities and rights against each Contributor and its Related
Persons, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, determined, determinable or otherwise, that the Royal Entities or
their respective Buyer Related Persons has ever had, may now or hereafter
have to the extent, and only to the extent, arising from facts,
occurrences or circumstances existing at or prior to the Closing, in each
case, relating to the ownership by such Contributor of the Royal Entities or
the business of the Royal Entities, including pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Royal Entities (and any breaches thereof), whether in law or
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in any capacity, other than
obligations arising under the covenants which expressly surviving Closing as

to cause the Royal Entities and Buyer Related Persons not to assert any
Proceeding against the Contributors or any of their Related Persons with
respect to the Royal Released Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

limitations on the ability of the Partnership or Buyer to exercise or assert
any rights or remedies against Royal, the Contributors or any of their Related
Persons or any other Person that may arise (i) out of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions, or (ii) as a result of the
ownership by such Contributor or its Related Persons of any Interests in the
Partnership or Buyer, as applicable, from and after the Closing.

9.4   _Conflict Waiver_.

  



  

(a)  Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Royal Entities and their Subsidiaries,
to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating
to the representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_
"), of the Contributors or any of their Affiliates, or any equityholder,
officer, employee, manager or director of the Contributors or any of their
Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter
involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions, by any
legal counsel currently representing any Designated Person in connection with
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions, including
Kirkland and Ellis LLP (any such representation, the " _Current Representation_
").

  



  

(b)  Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Royal Entities, to waive and not
assert, any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection
with respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any
Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation (the "
_Privileged Communications_ ") or in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any Royal Entity), it being the
intention of the Parties that all such rights to such attorney-client
and other applicable legal privilege or protection and to control such
attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or protection shall be
retained by the Contributors and their Affiliates and that the Contributors,
and not Buyer or its Affiliates or the Royal Entities, shall have the sole
right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege or protection. Accordingly, from and after
Closing, none of Buyer or its Affiliates, including the Royal Entities, shall
have any access to any such communications or to the files of the Current
Representation, all of which shall be and remain the property of the
Contributors and not of Buyer or its Affiliates, including the Royal Entities,
or to internal counsel relating to such engagement, and none of Buyer or its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Royal Entities, or any
Person acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain the
same by any process on the grounds that the privilege and
protection attaching to such communications and files belongs to Buyer or its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Royal Entities, or does not
belong to the Contributors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Buyer or its Affiliates, including, following the
Closing, the Royal Entities, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Contributors or their Affiliates, on the other hand, Buyer or its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Royal Entities, shall be entitled to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party
and the Contributors shall not permit such disclosure to the extent requested
by Buyer.

10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
supersede all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties and/or
their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the
sole and entire agreement between the Parties and their Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

10.3 _  Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether
or not the Transactions are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions,
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses;
_provided_ that in the event that the Transactions are consummated, the
Partnership shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all expenses described in
_Schedule 1.1(a)-TE_ and _Schedule 1.1(b)-TE_.

  



  

10.4 _Disclosure_. Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized
terms used in the Schedules shall have the respective meanings assigned to
such terms in this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, neither the Schedules, the exhibits nor any disclosure made in or
by virtue of them constitutes or implies any representation, warranty, or
covenant by the Contributors, the Royal Entities or Buyer not expressly set
out in the Agreement, and, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
neither the Schedules, the exhibits, nor any such disclosure has the effect
of, or may be construed as, adding to, broadening, deleting from or
revising the scope of any of the representations, warranties, or covenants of
the Contributors, the Royal Entities or Buyer in the Agreement. Any
information, item or other disclosure set forth in any Schedule, shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement
(or to have been set forth in any other Schedule), if the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure notwithstanding the omission of a reference or a cross-
reference with respect thereto and notwithstanding any reference to a
Schedule, as applicable, in such section of this Agreement. The fact that any
item of information is contained in the Schedules is not an admission of
liability under any applicable Law, and does not mean that such information
is material, but rather is intended only to qualify the representations,
warranties and covenants in the Agreement and to set forth other information
required by the Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply that
such amount, or a higher or lower amount, or the item so included, or any
other item, is or is not material, and no Party shall use the specification
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between or among the Parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Schedules is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement. The information set forth on the
Schedules or exhibits shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material", "materially", "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect", or any
similar qualification in this Agreement. Neither the specification of any item
or matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or another item or matter, is or is not in
the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the specification or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
or among the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter described
or not described herein or included or not included in the Schedules is or is
not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of the Agreement.
Headings have been inserted in the Schedules for reference only and do not
amend the descriptions of the disclosed items set forth in the Agreement.

  



  

   

67

 



    

  



  

10.5 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any
Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law, will, subject to _Section
9.2_ , be cumulative and not alternative.

  



  

10.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by the Contributors and Buyer;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this _Section 10.6_ , _Section 10.7_ , _Section 10.12_ , _Section 10.15_ and
_Section 10.17_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would
modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented,
waived or otherwise modified in any manner that is adverse in any respect to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

  



  

10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Except for the provisions of _Sections
6.5_ and _9.3_ and _10.15_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons identified therein), the terms and provisions of this Agreement are
intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to
confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person; _provided_ that
only Buyer and each Contributor (and their respective successors and assigns)
will have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its behalf
or on behalf of any of its related indemnitees (but shall not be obligated to
do so)provided further that the Financing Sources shall be deemed third
party beneficiaries of _Section 10.6_ , this _Section 10.7_ , _Section 10.12_
, _Section 10.15_ and _Section 10.17 _ (and the defined terms used in such
sections), each of which shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and, to
the extent enforced thereby, construed in accordance with, and governed by,
the Laws of the State of New York without reference to the conflict of laws
principles thereof. Without limiting the provisions of this _Section 10.7_ and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto (a) agrees that it will not bring or support any action cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (c)
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 10.1_ shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, (d) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (e) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

   

68

 



    

  



  

10.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate, but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be void, except for
assignments and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section 10.8_
, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable
by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

10.9 _Headings_. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and do not modify, define or limit any of the
terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

10.10 _Invalid Provisions_. Upon any determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable rule of Law or public policy, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

10.11 _ Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
.pdf copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

  



  

10.12 _ Governing Law; Venue; and Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to any conflict of laws
principles thereof); _provided_ that (without limiting the provisions of
_Section 10.7_ and _Section 10.17_ ) any claims or causes of action (whether
in contract or tort) in connection with this Agreement against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Financing and the
transactions contemplated thereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York.

the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions. The Parties further agree that
the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions in any court or
jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain
execution of judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to
the extent permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against
a Party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATED

10.13 _  Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus
of Buyer, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-219025) (the " _Prospectus_ "),
and dated as of July 20, 2017. Each of Royal, the Contributors and the Royal
Entities acknowledges that it has read the Prospectus, the Trust Agreement
and the Organizational Documents of Buyer and understands that Buyer has
established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial public
offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring
simultaneously with the IPO initially in an amount of approximately $275
million for the benefit of Buyer's public stockholders and certain parties
(including the underwriters of the IPO) and that Buyer may disburse monies
from the Trust Account only: (a) to Buyer's public stockholders in the event
they elect to exercise their Buyer Stockholder Redemption Right, (b) to
Buyer's public stockholders if Buyer fails to consummate a Business
Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the IPO, (c)
to pay any franchise and Income Taxes with any interest earned on the amounts
held in the Trust Account or (d) to Buyer after or concurrently with the
consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of Buyer
entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements with Royal, the
Contributors and the Royal Entities regarding the Transactions, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, Royal and each Contributor and the Royal Entities hereby
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for purposes of this
_Section 10.13_ , shall not give effect to the last sentence of the definition
of Affiliate), and Representatives that except as provided below, it does not
now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim or bring any Proceeding against, the Trust
Account, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection
with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business relationship
between Buyer and Royal, the Contributors or the Royal Entities or any of
their Affiliates or Representatives, this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the Transactions or any other matter, and regardless of whether
such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability. Each of Royal and the Contributors, on behalf of itself and the
Royal Entities, and its and their Affiliates and Representatives, (i)
hereby irrevocably waives any such claims it may have against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
(including the negotiation, execution and performance thereof) or any other
Contract with Buyer, the Transactions or any other matter and will not seek
recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom)
for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement), (ii) agrees and acknowledges that such
irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon
by Buyer to induce it to enter in this Agreement, and each of the Each of
Royal and the Contributors further intends and understands such waiver to be
valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law and (iii) acknowledges and
agrees that, to the extent Royal, any Contributor, any Royal Entity or any of
their Affiliates or Representatives commences any action or proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
Buyer, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against
Buyer, the sole remedy of any such Person shall be against funds held outside
of the Trust Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
10.13_ shall serve to limit or prohibit (i) the Contributors' or Royal
Entities' right to pursue a claim against Buyer for legal relief against
assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other non-
monetary relief, or (ii) any claims that the Contributors or Royal Entities
may have in the future against Buyer's assets or funds that are not held in
the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust
Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such
funds). This paragraph will survive the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

  



  

   

70

 



    

  



  

10.14 _ Affiliate Status_. To the extent that a Party is required hereunder
to take certain action with respect to entities designated in this Agreement
as such Party's Affiliates, such obligation shall apply to such entities only
during such period of time that such entities are Affiliates of such Party.
To the extent that this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement requires an
Affiliate of any Party to take or omit to take any action, such agreement and
obligation includes the obligation of such Party to cause such Affiliate to
take or omit to take such action.

  



  

10.15 _ Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may
be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement or the Transactions, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Parties. Except in
the case of Fraud, no Person who is not a Party, including any current, former
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Party, or any current, former
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and
any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing or any Financing
Source (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the
Transactions, or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than any liability
of any Financing Source to Buyer, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates
pursuant to or in connection with any agreement by or between them), and, to
the maximum extent permitted by Laws, each Party hereby waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any
such Nonparty Affiliates (other than any liability of any Financing Source to
Buyer, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates pursuant to or in
connection with any agreement by or between them). Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Laws, (a) each Party hereby
waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action
that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to
avoid or disregard the entity form of a Party or otherwise impose liability
of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil,
unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement (other than any liability of any
Financing Source to Buyer, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates pursuant
to or in connection with any agreement by or between them).

  



  

10.16 _  Continuing Directors_. Following the Closing, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director if there
shall only be one Continuing Director then in office) shall be required to
authorize (a) any amendment, supplement or modification to, or termination of
this Agreement by or on behalf of the Buyer or (b) any exercise or waiver of
any rights or remedies of Buyer or enforceable by Buyer with respect to any
provisions, covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement contemplated
to survive or be performed after the Closing. Following the Closing, any
action by Buyer with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement, as such
enforcement relates to the payment of Indebtedness of the Royal Entities and
Transaction Expenses as set forth in _Section 6.11(a) and (b)_ , by or on
behalf of Buyer shall be effected only by and at the direction of a majority
of the Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director if
there shall only be one Continuing Director then in office), and any such
authorization or direction shall constitute the authorization and direction
of the full Buyer Board with respect thereto, and no other action on the part
of Buyer, including any action by any other director of Buyer, shall be
required to authorize, or for Buyer to take, any such action. In connection
with the foregoing, the Continuing Directors shall have the authority to
retain such counsel and other advisors at the expense of Buyer as reasonably
determined by the Continuing Directors and any such reasonable and
documented expenses shall be paid by Buyer promptly upon written request by
the Continuing Directors.

  



  

10.17 _  Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Contributor agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that (a) none of the Financing Sources
shall have any liability to Royal or any Contributor or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transaction, including the financing of the Transaction, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) neither Royal, any
Contributor nor any of their respective Affiliates will have any rights or
claims against any Financing Sources under this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the
Transaction, including any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of
financing the Transaction.
