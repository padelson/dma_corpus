condition, business or results of operations of the Group, taken as a whole,
that has had a Group Material Adverse Effect. No member of the Group has
taken any action during the period from March 29, 2014 through the date of
this Agreement that would have been

 



35  prohibited by Section 6.1 (Group Interim Covenants) or Section 10.3 (Interim
Tax Covenants) if such action had been taken during the period from the date

29, 2014 and that would not be materially adverse to the Group, taken as a
whole.

 

Section 4.10 _Actions and Litigation_. As of the date hereof and, except as
would not be materially adverse to the Group taken as a whole, as of the
Closing Date, there are no material Actions pending, or to the Knowledge of

or contributes to, or is party to, any Benefit Plans, other than the Excluded
Incentive Arrangements.

 

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, each Company has made available to the
Purchaser a correct and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists,

plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified. Each
such plan and the related trust has timely received a favorable determination
letter, or is entitled to rely on a favorable advisory or opinion letter, from
the Internal Revenue Service that has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge
of the Companies, there are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be
expected adversely to affect the qualified status of any such plan or the
related trust.

 



36 (d) No member of the Group (excluding those in the United Kingdom, with
respect to the UK Pension Obligations and those in the United States, with
respect to the US Pension Obligations) has, or would reasonably be expected to
have, any liability in respect of any defined benefit pension plan (as defined
in Section 3(35) of ERISA) or plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA. The Companies have made available to Purchaser all
actuarial valuations and reports in respect of the US Defined Benefit Pension

employment health, medical or life insurance benefits for any current or
former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of any member of
the Group, except as may be required under COBRA or similar Laws and at the

contractor or in amounts that are not material to the Group, taken as a
whole.

(f) No Non-Group Seller Entity employs any employee or retains
any independent contractor. No member of the Group is a party to any

council or staff association is currently seeking to represent any member of
the Groups employees. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the

including all applicable Laws relating to employees, employment
discrimination, labor relations, payment of wages and overtime, leaves of
absence, employment tax and social security, occupational health and safety,
and immigration.

 

(g) No member of the Group is a party to any agreement under which any
employee or independent contractor is entitled to any "gross-up" payment in
respect of Taxes under Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code. Except as would not
be material to the Group, taken as a whole, (i) each Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
maintained in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the
Code and (ii) no stock option granted pursuant to any Benefit Plan had an
exercise price per share as of the grant date that was less than the fair
market value of a share underlying such stock option as of such date, as
determined by the applicable plan administrator in good faith and in
compliance with the relevant Internal Revenue Service guidance in effect on
the date of grant (including, without limitation, Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)
of the Treasury Regulations).

 



37 (h) The consummation of the Transactions would not reasonably be expected to
result in (i) severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date of this Agreement, (ii) any payment,
compensation or benefit becoming due, or increase in the amount of any
payment, compensation or benefit due, to any employee of the Group, (iii) the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of compensation or benefits or
(iv) the termination, winding up or the imposition of any liability under
Sections 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995 in respect of the UK Defined
Benefit Pension Plan, provided, that no representation or warranty is made by
the Companies with respect to any such termination, winding up or imposition
of liability which arises out of, relates to, or results from, (x) the
assignment of the Pension Credit Support Agreement to the Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates or any failure of the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to
assume the Pension Credit Support Agreement at or prior to the Closing or (y)
any action or inaction of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
any member of the Group) on or after the Closing. No member of the Group has
any obligation to make any payments to any director, officer or employee of
any member of the Group as a result of or in connection with the
Transactions, including any such obligations contained in the retention
agreements set forth on Section 4.12(h) of the Group Disclosure Letter (the "
_Retention Agreements_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(i) With respect to each Benefit Plan, no material Actions (other than routine
claims for benefits) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Companies,
threatened.

(j) With respect to each Benefit Plan maintained by any member of the Group
outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of the Groups
employees outside the United States, including any such benefit plan required
to be maintained or contributed to by applicable Law or custom of the relevant
jurisdiction (each, a " _Foreign Group Plan_ "): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Foreign Group Plan required by Law or by the
terms of such Foreign Group Plans have been made or accrued in accordance with
normal accounting practices; and (ii) each Foreign Group Plan required to be
registered (if required) has been registered and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable Governmental Authorities and, if intended to qualify
for special Tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment, in each
case, except as would not result in any material liability to the Group, taken
as a whole.

(k) The Companies have made available to the Purchaser a true and correct
copy of the most recent report delivered to the Companies by Mercer Limited
regarding the UK Pension Obligations, which report is dated as of April 5,
2014, and, to the Knowledge of the Companies, such report, and the factual
data upon which it is based, is complete and accurate in all material
respects. The UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan is the only Benefit Plan which
provides benefits on retirement, which is principally administered in
the United Kingdom and which is not a money purchase scheme within the
meaning of s.181 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993.

Purchaser on the contemplated action; and

(ii) no member of the Group shall agree to any material provision previously
identified by the Purchaser and the Seller without the prior consent in
writing or by email of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that if the Purchaser does not
respond within three (3) Business Days of any written request for such
consent, the Purchasers consent shall be deemed to have been granted.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.1(c)) or elsewhere in this
Agreement is intended to, nor shall it operate in any way so as to, provide

violation of any applicable Law (it being acknowledged and agreed that the

(c) enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial

Section 6.3 _Pre-Closing Access and Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller shall, and shall cause the
members of the Group to, in connection with the Transactions and preparations
for the transition of ownership of the Group at the Closing, or for purposes

facilitate the integration and transition of ownership of the Groups
business and operations at the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
member of the Group shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information (x) the disclosure of or access to which is prohibited under
applicable Law (including any Competition Law) or the confidentiality
provisions of any Contract to which any member of the Group is a party,
provided that such Group member has used reasonable best efforts to seek a
waiver of any such restriction or otherwise seek to provide access to such
information in a manner that does not violate such restriction, or (y) the
disclosure of which would cause the Seller or any member of the Group to waive
its attorney-client privilege with respect to such information; and
_provided_ , _further_ that the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives
shall not conduct any invasive environmental sampling at any of the Real
Property.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall treat all information obtained from the Group which is
non-public as Proprietary Information (as such term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) and the Purchaser shall continue to honor, and
cause the Purchasers Representatives to honor, its obligations thereunder.
The Purchaser shall also treat as confidential and not disclose any
information it or its Representatives may learn about the direct and indirect
equityholders of the Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and its
Affiliates (i) may

 



59  disclose any non-competitively sensitive information regarding the Group and
its business, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
Transactions (x) in connection with the Financing or (y) that is reasonably
required for regulatory or compliance purposes (including disclosures made to
comply with any securities regulation or securities exchange rule), and (ii)
may disclose any information previously approved for disclosure by the
Seller, and in either case without the prior written consent of the Seller.

(c) Prior to Closing, the Purchaser shall not contact any customer or
supplier of the Group with respect to the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.4 _Affiliate Agreements_. From and after the Closing, all Affiliate
Agreements shall be terminated without any ongoing obligation or liability of
any party thereto, and Seller shall take such action as may be necessary so
that, effective as of the Closing, there shall be no liabilities, indebtedness
or other obligations owed to or from any member of the Group, on the one
hand, and the Seller or any Seller Affiliated Person, on the other hand.

and the Companies agree to supply, or cause to be supplied, as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under

hereof. The Seller shall, and shall procure that the Companies and their
Affiliates shall, cooperate with the Purchaser in furnishing such information
as may be required to make the HSR Filings, the Additional Filings and any
other filings and any additional information or documentary material that may
be required under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws in a timely and
efficient manner (provided that the Companies may provide confidential
information directly to any Governmental Authority with an advance copy to the
Purchasers counsel on an outside counsel only basis consistent with Section
7.2(a)). The Purchaser and the Companies shall not (A) extend any waiting
period or agree to re-file under the HSR Act (except with the prior written
consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (B) enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority agreeing not to consummate the
Transactions.

 



60 (b) Each of the Purchaser and the Companies shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to do, or cause to be done, any
and all steps necessary, proper, or advisable to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under the HSR Act and any other Competition Laws that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority or any third Person so as to enable
the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable,
and in any event prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Purchaser be required to sell, divest or dispose of
assets, properties or businesses (including assets, properties or businesses
to be acquired by it under this Agreement) that generated total worldwide
revenues in excess of $35,000,000 in calendar year 2013. In addition,
until the Outside Date, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend through any Action on the merits, including through appeal, any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date.

(c) The Purchaser shall not enter into any transaction, or any agreement to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition), that might
reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially
increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration and termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws applicable to
the Transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of any Action
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order that would materially delay or
prevent the completion of the Transactions, or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consent orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

(d) The Purchaser and the Companies shall pay, or cause to be paid, in equal
proportions, all filing or other fees incurred in connection with the HSR

Section 7.2 _Consents_.

 

(a) Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.1 (Competition Filings), each
of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Companies shall cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to (i) make, as promptly as practicable, all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions and obtain, as
promptly as practicable, from any Governmental Authority any authorizations,
exemptions, certificates, registrations, clearances, consents, orders,
approvals, permits or licenses that are required under any applicable Law to
be obtained or made by the Seller, any member of the Group or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii)
respond to any requests for information under any applicable Law. Except to
the extent prohibited by applicable Law, the Purchaser, the Seller and the
Companies shall consider in good faith the views of one another in connection
with and provide to the other in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, filings, submissions, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto pursuant
to this Section 7.2(a) or any correspondence or communications between the
Purchaser, the Seller, the Companies or any of their Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand in connection with
any filings or submissions made

 



61  pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) and if requested, accept reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that any correspondence or communications
provided to the other party pursuant to this sentence, may be redacted (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Group, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any applicable Law. None of
the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting,
telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, Action (including the settlement of any Action) or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion.

 

(b) Each Company shall give (and shall cause any applicable member of the
Group to give) any notices to third Persons, and use (and shall cause any
applicable member of the Group to use) reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents or approvals from third Persons required in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions under any Material Group Contracts. If either
Company or any member of the Group fails to obtain any such consent from a
third Person, then the Companies shall (and shall cause the Group members to)
use reasonable best efforts to limit the adverse effect upon the Group from
the failure to obtain such consent. The Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to assist the Company and the Group in obtaining all such consents and
providing such notices, including providing any reasonable information or
executing any documents reasonably required in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but without limiting the parties obligations
pursuant to Section 7.1 (Competition Filings), none of the Purchaser, the
Companies or any other member of the Group shall have any obligation to pay
any fee or similar payment to any third Person for the purpose of obtaining
such consent or any costs and expenses of any third Person resulting from the
process of obtaining any such consent.

prompt notice to the Purchaser upon becoming aware of (i) any notices,
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Authorities with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) any written notices or other written communications from
any third Persons alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required with respect to the Transactions, (iii) the institution of any
material Action involving any member of the Group relating to the Transactions
or (iv) any material confidential information becoming compromised.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser shall give prompt notice to
the Seller and the Companies upon becoming aware of (i) any notices,

Transactions, (ii) any written notices or other written communications from
any third Persons alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be

pertaining to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be issued in such
form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, and no
party hereto shall issue or otherwise make any public announcement or
communication pertaining to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser; _provided_ , that if
any such public announcement or communication is required by applicable Law,
IFRS, GAAP or the rules and regulations of a stock exchange or trading system
to be made by any party hereto, then such party shall be permitted to make

public announcement or communication, such party shall (a) use reasonable
best efforts to consult with the Seller and the Purchaser regarding the
contents of such public announcement or communication, (b) deliver a draft of
such public announcement or communication to the Seller and the

the Seller Representative shall not, and shall cause Parent, the Companies and
the Group, their respective Affiliates and their Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (a) take any action intended to solicit, initiate,
resume, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (b) other
than informing Persons of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 7.5, engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or enter into
any agreement relating to, any Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years following the Closing Date, the Group shall, and
if it fails to, the Purchaser shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless all
current and former directors and officers of the Group (each, a " _Group
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Group Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any Damages (including any Damages described in clause (ii) of the
definition of "Purchaser Group Liabilities") incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, incurred or
suffered by such Group Indemnified Party by reason of: (i) any act or
omission or alleged act or omission performed or omitted to be performed on
behalf of any member of the Group or otherwise in connection with the business
of any member of the Group; or (ii) the fact that he or she is or was a
director or officer of the any member of the Group, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent that
such member of the Group, or the Purchaser, as the case may be, would have
been permitted, under applicable Law, indemnification agreements existing on
the date hereof or the applicable Organizational Documents in effect on the
date hereof, to indemnify such Group Indemnified Party (and members of the
Group shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnification agreements or the applicable
Organizational Documents). For a period of six years following the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group to, ensure that the
provisions in the Organizational Documents of each member of the Group
allowing for the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to the Group
Indemnified Parties and the provision of insurance for the Group Indemnified
Parties shall not be amended in a manner that would limit the scope of such
indemnification and insurance, except as required by applicable Law.

 



63 (b) The Companies shall purchase (or shall cause to be purchased) "tail"
insurance policies comparable in all material respects to the Groups current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
Group Indemnified Parties that shall provide such Group Indemnified Parties
with coverage for a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, with
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in
the aggregate than the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Group with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , however, that the Companies shall not be obligated to expend
more than 300% of the annual premium for the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Group in the aggregate to
purchase such "tail" insurance. If such insurance coverage can only be
obtained at a premium in excess of 300% of such current annual premium, the
Companies shall obtain and maintain one or more policies with the greatest
coverage available for an aggregate premium equal to 300% of such current
annual premium. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Purchaser and the Companies shall each be responsible for and shall pay
one half of the price for the "tail" insurance policies to be purchased by
the Companies under this Section 7.6(b).

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Group Indemnified Party and each party
entitled to insurance coverage under this Section 7.6, respectively, and his
or her heirs and legal representatives, which shall be deemed as third party
beneficiaries under this Agreement, and shall be in addition to, and shall
not impair, any other rights a Group Indemnified Party may have under the
applicable Organizational Documents of any member of the Group, under
applicable Law or any indemnification agreement. The Purchaser shall ensure
that the members of the Group comply with all of their respective obligations
under this Section 7.6 and the Purchaser hereby guarantees all such
obligations of the Group under this Section 7.6.

 

(d) If the Purchaser or any member of the Group (or any of their respective
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and is not the continuing company or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall cause proper provisions to be
made such that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser or such member of
the Group (as applicable) shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.6.

 

Section 7.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, for a period of no less
than one year following the Closing Date, cause the Group to provide
individuals who are employed by any member of the Group immediately prior to
the Closing Date and who remain employed by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Employees_ ") with salaries, wages, bonus, commission and
incentive opportunities and employee benefits that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to the Employees by such member of the Group
immediately prior to the Closing.

 



64 (b) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company to, honor all Benefit Plans and each written contract between any
member of the Group, on the one hand, and any employees, officers, directors
or consultants of such member of the Group, on the other hand, in accordance
with their respective terms as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.7 of this Agreement shall in any way
restrict or limit the ability of the Purchaser or any member of the Group to
(i) modify, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or Contract referred to in
the preceding sentence in accordance with its terms or obligate any of them to
continue any such Benefit Plan or Contract for any time after the Closing Date
or (ii) terminate the employment of any Employee at any time after the
Closing Date.

(c) The Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates shall cause all of their
benefit plans, policies or arrangements under which Employees participate to
recognize service with the Group (including predecessors) prior to the Closing
Date, for all purposes to the same extent recognized by the Group under a
corresponding Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, provided that such
service recognition shall not be required for purposes of retiree medical
programs, for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit retirement
plans, or where such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
(or where similar credit is not given to other similarly situated employees
of Purchaser).

(d) With respect to all welfare benefit plans and other US Group Plans
maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Employees
on and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable
member of the Group or such plan to, make commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods applicable to the Employees (and their covered dependents), and (ii)
in determining any deductible, out-of-pocket limitations, co-payments
or similar requirements under healthcare plans, give full credit towards
satisfying any applicable deductible or similar requirements for the
applicable plan year in which the Closing Date occurs with respect to an
amount equal to the excess of the total expenses paid by any Employee during
the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Closing Date pursuant to
all Benefit Plans that are healthcare plans.

 

(e) Purchaser shall have no liability in respect of the Excluded Incentive
Arrangements, and the Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its
Affiliates harmless in respect of the Excluded Incentive Arrangements and any
liabilities thereunder.

(f) The Companies will provide to the Purchaser within ten Business Days
following the date of this Agreement a correct and complete list of each
current employee of all members of the Group as of the date of this Agreement,
with such list indicating each employees job title, status (active or on
statutory or employer approved leave and full-time or part-time), annual base
salary or wage rate, target annual bonus, work location, and years of service.
Such list shall be updated by the Companies as of a date as near as
practicable to the Closing Date and provided to the Purchaser no later than
the Closing Date.

(g) Nothing in this Section 7.7, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any Person (including any current or former director, officer or employee
of, or consultant or independent contractor to, the Purchaser, any member of
the Group or any of their 

 



65  respective Affiliates) any third party beneficiary or other rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period or continued participation in any benefit plan, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.7. No provision
of this Section 7.7 is intended to and such provisions do not modify, amend or
create any employee benefit plan of the Purchaser, any member of the Group or
any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 7.8 _280G Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall, or
shall cause an Affiliate of the Seller to, (a) solicit, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, from each "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such individual of any and all
payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
Transactions (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to
the extent necessary so that such payments and benefits would not be
"excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, (b) submit to the
Shareholders for a vote all such waived payments in a manner such that, if
such vote is adopted by such shareholders in a manner that satisfies the
shareholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder, no payment received by such "disqualified
individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code

to the Purchaser evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser of the
results of such vote. Such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to receive or retain the payment or other
compensation. In addition, the Seller shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
the Seller to, provide adequate disclosure to the Shareholders of all material
facts concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" to any such "disqualified individual" under Section 280G
of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Seller shall provide or cause to
be provided to the Purchaser written drafts of the shareholder disclosure
statement, waivers, and shareholder approval forms that will be provided to
disqualified individuals and shareholders in advance of delivering such
documents to the disqualified individuals and shareholders, as applicable, and
allow the Purchaser and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to
provide comments on such documents.

the Companies and the Seller Representatives obligations under Section
7.9(a), shall not be deemed unsatisfied due to a breach by the Companies or
the Seller Representatives breach(es) of their obligations under Section
7.9(a) unless such breach materially contributed to a failure to obtain
Financing.

 

(c) Subject to Section 7.9(d), the Companies shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver all notices and take other actions required to facilitate the

and the Mezzanine Credit Agreement and, to the extent requested by the

Indebtedness is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee or other representative
on behalf of such Persons, which Payoff Letters together with any related
release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount
(the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and provide in substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, among other things, that Liens (and 

 



67  guarantees), if any, granted in connection therewith relating to the assets,
rights and properties of the Parent and its Subsidiaries securing such
Indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, shall be, upon the

applicable redemption notice. At or prior to the Closing (but subject to the
Closing occurring), the Seller Representative shall cause the obligors under
the PIK Notes to discharge the PIK Notes by paying to the holders of the PIK

credit or cash collateral by any member of the Group; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not require the Seller or any of the Companies to pay any
amount, continue or grant any guarantee or Lien or post any letter(s) of
credit or cash collateral (it being acknowledged and agreed that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any member of the
Group may take the actions mutually agreed by the Seller and the Purchaser).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if after
complying with their obligations pursuant to this Section 7.9(d), the Seller
and the Companies fail to obtain the release, discharge, removal and
termination of all liens on the assets of the Group and equity interests
in members of the Group arising under the Specified Swaps and Seller notifies
the Purchaser in writing of such failure prior to Closing, none of the Seller
or any of the Companies shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
any breach of any other covenant or agreement or any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement with respect to such liens to the extent
resulting from such failure.

keep, information and books and records held by any member of the Group
relating to the Seller for a period of three years from the Closing Date,
during which time the Purchaser shall make such information and books and
records available to the Seller Representative as the Seller Representative
may reasonably require in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute
or litigation, _provided_ that the Seller Representative shall reimburse the
Purchaser for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any such request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) any such access rights shall be exercised in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Group or the 

 



68  Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the Purchaser may withhold any
document (or portions thereof) or information to the extent that (x) it may
not be disclosed pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure agreement with a
third party, provided that Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a
waiver of such restriction or otherwise seek to provide access to such
information in a manner that does not violate such restriction, or (y) the
disclosure would cause the Purchaser or any member of the Group to waive its
attorney-client privilege with respect to such information.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Seller and the Seller
Representative shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
and Representatives to, keep all documents, materials, records and other
information that it has or has obtained prior to or after the Closing
regarding the Purchaser or any member of the Group (" _Confidential
Information_ ") strictly confidential and will not disclose such information
without the Purchasers prior written consent. "Confidential Information"

than as a result of a disclosure by Seller, the Seller Representative or the
Parent Securityholders or their respective Representatives in violation of
this Section 7.10(b)), (ii) is or becomes available to them from a source
that, to their knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such information

of the Group) or their respective Representatives without reference to
Confidential Information.

that purport to survive termination of the Confidentiality Agreement).

practicable prepare and file with the NYSE an Additional Listing Application
with respect to the Purchaser Shares and shall use its reasonable best efforts

contract to sell, transfer, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any
short sale or otherwise dispose of (each such transaction, a " _Transfer_ ")
any of the Purchaser Shares or any options or warrants to purchase any
Purchaser Shares, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that
represent the right to receive shares of the Purchaser Shares or engage in any
hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could
be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Purchaser
Shares. However, nothing in this Section 7.12 shall prevent or restrict the
Seller or any Permitted Transferee from pledging any of the Purchaser Shares
to any bona fide third party lender or Transferring Purchaser Shares (a) in
connection with a sale of the Purchaser approved by the Board of Directors of
the Purchaser (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of shares of capital
stock, other business combination transaction, sale of all or substantially
all of the assets or otherwise) or a tender offer or exchange offer for all of
the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock, (b) to any Affiliate or
direct or indirect equityholders of such Permitted Transferee or (c) to any
family

 



69  member of such Permitted Transferee or trust for estate planning purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each such case, it shall be a condition to
the Transfer that (i) the lender or transferee either execute and deliver an
Investor Representation Letter and be a Permitted Transferee and (ii) there
shall be no further Transfer of such Purchaser Shares except in accordance
with the lock-up provisions of this Section 7.12. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 7.12 shall be construed to apply to any shares of
capital stock of the Purchaser owned by the Seller or any Permitted Transferee
other than the Purchaser Shares.

engagement, in each case, which is not directed or focused on employees of the
Group or such Senior Managers, (b) apply with respect to any such Senior
Manager who ceases to be employed by the Group or the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries at least six (6) months prior to any direct or indirect
solicitation by the Seller Representative, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives or (c) apply with respect to any such Senior
Manager who is terminated by the Purchaser or any member of the Group
following the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.14 to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 7.14 shall not apply to any
portfolio company of the Seller Representative or any of its Affiliates,
_provided_ that such portfolio company is not acting at the direction or on
behalf of, and has not received any non-public information regarding Group
employees from, the Seller Representative or any of its Affiliates.

Section 7.15 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party to this Agreement agrees to execute such documents
and other papers and use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all action and to perform or cause to be performed all things and acts
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including contesting any Action
relating to the Transactions. No document executed pursuant to this Section
7.15 shall be deemed to expand or limit the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto beyond those provided in this Agreement or provide for any
additional rights or obligations of the parties hereto that are not provided
for in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any
such documents and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH

JURISDICTION. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

DAYS AFTER [THE CLOSING DATE]."

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement,

the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other
to exchange the Sellers certificates for such relevant Purchaser Shares for
new certificates not bearing a legend restricting transfer under the

opinions as Purchaser and the Purchasers registrar and transfer agent may
reasonably request in connection therewith.

their reasonable best efforts to terminate each of the guarantees from a Non-

Entity Guarantees_ ") and replace the letters of credit set forth on Section
7.17(a) of the Group Disclosure Letter or any letters of credit identified or

credit support provided by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, in each
case, effective as of the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser
shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the beneficiary of each

substitute guarantee or such other form of assurance (including a letter of
credit or other cash collateral) as may be reasonably requested by the
beneficiary of each such Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the beneficiary of a Non-Group Seller Entity
LofC to exchange such Non-Group Seller Entity LofC for a new letter of credit
issued for the account of the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, in each

71 (b) To the extent Seller and Purchaser are unable to terminate or replace a
Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee or a Non-Group Seller Entity LofC or obtain
the beneficiarys consent to the substitution therefor at or prior to the
Closing as contemplated in Section 7.17(a), Seller agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts (and to cause its Affiliates to use their reasonable
best efforts) to maintain each such Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee or a
Non-Group Seller Entity LofC in place until the expiration of the then-current
term of the underlying Contract or other obligation supported by each such
Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee or Non-Group Seller Entity LofC in
accordance with its terms (it being understood that after each such
expiration, the Seller and/or its Affiliates shall have no obligation to
renew any such Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee or Non-Group Seller Entity
LofC). Purchaser shall have a continuing obligation after the Closing to use
its reasonable best efforts to have any such Non-Group Seller Entity Guarantee
or Non-Group Seller Entity LofC terminated or replaced in a manner consistent
with the last sentence of Section 7.17(a).

(c) Pending the release of the Seller and its Affiliates from the Non-Group
Seller Entity Guarantees and Non-Group Seller Entity LofCs, the Purchaser
shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates from and against any amounts
paid by any of them after Closing pursuant to any such Non-Group Seller
Entity Guarantees and Non-Group Seller Entity LofCs. All costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the release or substitution of the Non-Group
Seller Entity Guarantees and the Non-Group Seller Entity LofCs shall be borne
by the Purchaser.

") from and against any Damages incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified

 



75  Party to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from (or
constituting, in the case of clause (iii)): (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller set forth in Article III of this
Agreement or of the Companies set forth in Article IV of this Agreement, as of
the Closing Date (other than representations and warranties that address
matters only as of an earlier date, in which case, as of such earlier date) (
_provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 9.1(a), any materiality,
material adverse effect, "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or "Group Material
Adverse Effect" qualification therein shall be disregarded and not given
effect, except in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.7(a), (b) and (f) (Financial Statements; Indebtedness), Section 4.8
(No Group Material Adverse Effect; Absence of Certain Developments), the
categories of Material Group Contracts in Section 4.16(a) (Contracts) and the
word "Material" in the term "Material Group Contracts" and _provided_
_further_ that, any indemnification for Conveyance Taxes as a result of a
breach of Section 4.13(s) shall be subject to Section 10.6 (Conveyance
Taxes)); (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Seller or any
Company set forth in this Agreement; (iii) any Conveyance Taxes for which the
Seller is liable under Section 10.6 (Conveyance Taxes); (iv) the Specified
Swaps, _provided_ that the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against only 90% of any Damages
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of,
relating to or resulting from the Specified Swaps; (v) the Specified Taxes,
_provided_ that the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against only 50% of any Specified
Taxes; or (vi) any Disclosed Taxes.

(b)  _Purchaser Indemnity_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Article IX, from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser hereby agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, successors and assigns (each, a " _Seller
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Party to the
extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from (or constituting, in the
case of clause (iii)): (i) any breach of any Purchaser Fundamental
Representation, as of the Closing Date (other than representations and
warranties that address matters only as of an earlier date, in which case, as
of such earlier date) ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 9.1(b),
any materiality, material adverse effect, or "Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect" qualification therein shall be disregarded and not given effect,
except in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
5.6 (No Purchaser Material Adverse Effect; Absence of Certain Developments));
(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement (including Purchasers covenants in Section 7.17 (Release from
Seller Credit Support Instruments)); or (iii) any Purchaser Group Liabilities.

 

Section 9.2 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the
commencement of any Action involving a third party (such Action, a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto
is to be made against any party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Party (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "); provided that
the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
such failure to give notice shall prejudice any defense or claim available to
the Indemnifying Party.

 



76 (b) The Indemnifying Party may undertake and assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense within 30 days
of receiving such Third Party Claim Notice (or sooner if the nature of the
Third Party Claim so requires) with representatives chosen by it and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such 30-day period,
the Indemnified Party may make such filings, including motions for continuance
(and answers if a motion for continuance has not been granted), as may be
necessary to preserve the parties positions and rights with respect to such
Third Party Claim, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of a Third Party Claim, then
(i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel and one appropriate
local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction of the Indemnified Partys
choosing and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, which shall
be at the Indemnified Partys sole cost and expense, unless in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Partys counsel, representation of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests of or defenses available to such
parties, in which case the cost and expenses of such counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party advised of the status of the Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall reasonably consider recommendations made by the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto. In assuming the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may reserve its rights to claim that
indemnification is not required if, for example, new or subsequently
developed information demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party is not required
to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party, within 30 days after written notice of any
such Third Party Claim (or sooner if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) does not assume control of the defense or thereafter fails or ceases
to defend such Third Party Claim, then (i) the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim and (ii) the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel and any one appropriate local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction for the Indemnified Party with respect to a
single Third Party Claim or a series of related Third Party Claims be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.2 to the contrary, (i) the
Purchaser shall undertake and assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Specified Swaps) and shall defend such claim in good
faith, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment which (A) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim, (B) would impose a judgment that provides for anything
other than monetary damages or (C) would impose a judgment of monetary
damages in excess of the remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account,
(iii) the Indemnified Party shall not,

 



77  without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of an unconditional release from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and (iv) the Purchaser shall
not, without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Seller or the Seller
Representative, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(iv) (Specified Swaps).

(e) The parties hereto shall act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all information
relevant thereto subject to Section 6.3 (Pre-Closing Access and Information;
Confidentiality). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the party
controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to the other party, upon request, copies of all correspondence,
pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or other written statements relating to or
submitted in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim, and timely
notices of, and the right to participate (as an observer) in any hearing or
other court proceeding, meeting or negotiation relating to the Third Party
Claim.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing provisions
of this Section 9.2 shall not apply with respect to Taxes and any Tax
Proceedings.

Section 9.3 _Procedure for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under
this Article IX that does not involve a Third Party Claim shall deliver a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), promptly upon becoming aware of such
claim (but in no event more than 30 days after becoming aware of such claim),
to the Indemnifying Party, which shall (a) state in reasonable detail the
circumstances giving rise to the Damages, (b) specify the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement alleged to have been
breached or not performed by the Company (as applicable), (c) specify the
estimated amount of the Damages, if known (the " _Claim Amount_ "), and (d)
make a request for any payment then believed due. The failure of an
Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice in accordance with this Section
9.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations to provide
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party may, within 45 days after receipt
by such Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice, deliver to the Indemnified
Party a written response disputing such claim. If the Indemnifying Party in
such written response contests the payment of the Claim Amount, then the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute within the next 30
days. If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be reached between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party within such 30-day period, then
the parties may thereupon proceed to pursue any and all available remedies at
law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing provisions
of this Section 9.3 shall not apply with respect to Taxes and any Tax
Proceedings.

 



78 Section 9.4 _Survival; Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) _Survival_.

 

(i) All of the representations and warranties of Seller and the Companies set
forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of this Agreement until the
date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Release
Date_ "), at which time they shall expire, except for (A) the representations
of the Companies set forth in Section 4.27 (No Other Representations or
Warranties), which shall survive indefinitely and (B) the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Group Fundamental Representations, which shall survive
the Closing until thirty (30) days following the end of the Earnout Period,
at which time they shall expire. The indemnification obligations set forth in
Sections 9.1(a)(iv) (Specified Swaps), 9.1(a)(v) (Specified Taxes) and
9.1(a)(vi) (Disclosed Taxes) shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days
following the end of the Earnout Period, at which time they shall expire.

(ii) None of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser shall
survive the Closing, except for (A) the representations of the Purchaser set
forth in Section 5.9 (Independent Investigation) and Section 5.12 (No Other
Representations or Warranties), which shall survive indefinitely, and (B) the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations, which shall survive the Closing of this
Agreement until the Release Date, at which time they shall expire.

 

(iii) All covenants and agreements of the parties hereto set forth in this
Agreement to the extent requiring performance prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing until the Release Date, at which time they shall expire.
All covenants and other agreements of the parties hereto set forth in this
Agreement to the extent requiring performance from and after the
Closing shall survive the Closing and shall continue in accordance with their
terms, _provided_ that Purchasers obligation to indemnify the Seller for any
Specified Taxes pursuant to Section 9.1(b) (Purchaser Indemnity) shall survive
the Closing until thirty (30) days following the end of the Earnout Period,
at which time such obligation shall expire.

 

(iv) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to
Section 9.2 (Defense of Third Party Claims) or 9.3 (Procedure for Claims Not
Involving Third Parties) prior to the expiration as provided in this Section
9.4(a), of the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is the
basis for such claim, then such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement and the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations with
respect thereto shall survive past the date on which they would otherwise
expire until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim. If
an indemnification claim in respect of Taxes is asserted in writing prior to
the expiration, as provided in this Section 9.4(a), of the representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or indemnification obligation that is the basis
for such claim, then such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
indemnification obligation shall survive past the date on which they would
otherwise expire until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such
claim.

 



79 (b) _Deductible_. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for Damages claimed under Section 9.1(a) (Seller Indemnity)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by such
Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of such claims, taken together, exceeds
Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which time all Damages incurred in excess of the Deductible shall be
indemnifiable claims hereunder (subject to all the other terms and conditions
set forth herein); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Deductible shall not
apply to (A) claims with respect to the Sellers or any Companys actual and
intentional fraud with respect to any express provisions in this Agreement,
(B) claims pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(ii) (Covenants and Agreements), Section
9.1(a)(iii) (Conveyance Taxes), Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Specified Swaps), Section
9.1(a)(v) (Specified Taxes) or Section 9.1(a)(vi) (Disclosed Taxes), (C)
claims in respect of any breaches of any Seller Fundamental Representation or
Group Fundamental Representation and (D) claims in respect of Filing Taxes.

 

(c) _Cap_. The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages payable by
the Seller under Section 9.1(a)(i) (Representations and Warranties) and
Section 9.1(a)(iii) (Conveyance Taxes) in respect of all claims made
thereunder shall not exceed (i) Ten Million United States Dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "), other than (A) claims with respect to breaches
of any Seller Fundamental Representation or Group Fundamental Representation
and (B) claims with respect to the Sellers or any Companys actual and
intentional fraud with respect to any express provisions in this
Agreement. The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages payable by
the Seller in respect of all claims under Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Specified
Swaps)and Section 9.1(a)(vi) (Disclosed Taxes) shall not exceed the aggregate
Earnout Amount(s) (if any) payable pursuant to the Earnout Agreement. The
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages payable by the Seller in
respect of all claims under Section 9.1(a) (Seller Indemnity) shall not exceed
the Cap plus the aggregate Earnout Amount(s) (if any) payable pursuant to the
Earnout Agreement, other than claims with respect to the Sellers or any
Companys actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express provisions
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Satisfaction of Seller Indemnity Claims_. The Purchaser hereby agrees (on
behalf of itself and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties) that
indemnification claims made by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (Seller Indemnity) shall be satisfied exclusively
from the Indemnity Escrow Account, other than (i) claims under Section
9.1(a)(i) (Representations and Warranties) with respect to breaches of any
Seller Fundamental Representation or Group Fundamental Representation or
claims under Sections 9.1(a)(ii) (Covenants and Agreements) or 9.1(a)(vi)
(Disclosed Taxes), which shall be satisfied first from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and then, solely to the extent such claims exceed the amount then
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (if any), may be satisfied by the
Purchaser by a withholding from and an offset against any Earnout Amounts
that would otherwise be due to the Seller or Seller Representative under the
Earnout Agreement, and (ii) claims under Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Specified Swaps)
or Section 9.1(a)(v) (Specified Taxes), which shall be satisfied exclusively
by a withholding from and an offset against any Earnout Amounts that would
otherwise be due to the Seller or Seller Representative under the Earnout
Agreement (and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be satisfied from
the Indemnity Escrow Account); _provided_ , that if the amount of a Third
Party Claim under Section 9.1(a)(v) (Specified Taxes) is required to be
reserved for under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles prior to

 



80  the date on which all amounts have been released from the Indemnity Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, then such claim may be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account
and/or (without duplication) by a withholding from and an offset against any
Earnout Amounts that would otherwise be due to the Seller or Seller
Representative under the Earnout Agreement.

 

(e) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party have any liability to an
Indemnified Party for (i) any liability to the extent such liability is
reflected in the Pre-Closing Statement or the Post-Closing Statement and taken
into account in calculating the amount of the Consideration or (ii)
any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, except to the
extent actually paid to a third party.

(f) _Exclusivity of Indemnity_. After the Closing, the rights of an
Indemnified Party under this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of such Indemnified Party with respect to claims under this Agreement for
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the Transactions,
except in the case of actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express
provisions in this Agreement and except for any injunctive relief pursuant to
Section 12.7 (Specific Performance). Each of the Seller and the Purchaser
expressly waives, releases and agrees not to make any claim against the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Seller Representative, on
the other hand, except for indemnification claims made pursuant to this
Article IX, or for any injunctive relief pursuant to Section 12.7 (Specific
Performance), or for claims with respect to the Sellers or any Companys
actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express provisions in this
Agreement.

Section 9.5 _Mitigation_. 

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any
Damages after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder; provided,
however, that the costs of such mitigation shall be included as Damages. The
amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Article IX shall be (i) calculated on an After-Tax Basis and, without
duplication, (ii) reduced by any amounts actually recovered by any Indemnified
Party under any (A) indemnification or other recovery under any Contract
between an Indemnified Party and any third Person (other than a Governmental
Authority) and (B) insurance policies with respect to such indemnification
claim (less any increase in insurance premiums arising therefrom or related
thereto, costs incurred in obtaining such recovery under such insurance
policies and Taxes resulting from any recovery described in clause (A) or (B))
(each source named in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 9.5(a), a "
_Collateral Source_ "). An Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to pursue any claims against all Collateral Sources; _provided_ , that
such Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this Article IX in respect of such Damages. The
existence of a claim by an Indemnified Party for monies from a Collateral
Source in respect of any Damages shall not, however, delay any payment
pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise
determined to be due and owing by the Indemnifying Party.

 



81 (b) If an Indemnified Party has received the payment required under this
Article IX from the Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages and later
receives proceeds from insurance or payments from a Collateral Source in
respect of the same Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall hold such
proceeds or other similar amounts in trust for the benefit of the
Indemnifying Party and shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within 30 days
after receipt, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this Article IX, plus the amount
of the insurance payments or other recoveries from such Collateral Source
actually received by such Indemnified Party (less any increase in insurance
premiums arising therefrom or related thereto and any Taxes resulting from any
such payments or other recoveries), _over_ (ii) the amount of Damages with
respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to
receive under this Article IX. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, it is the intention of the parties hereto that no Collateral
Source shall be (A) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive
in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (B) relieved of
the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

(c) (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of
determining the amount of any Damages for Taxes in respect of which Seller
may have an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 9.1(a), (A) any and
all deductions, credits or other net Tax benefits, in each case of any member
of the Group, resulting from the Transactions, to the extent relating to
expenses that (x) result in a reduction of the Purchase Price, through
reflection in Actual Trade Working Capital or otherwise, or (y) are otherwise
paid or incurred by the Seller or any member of the Group on or prior to the
Closing Date in connection with the Transaction (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any repayment of debt in connection with the Closing and any
unamortized debt costs, any Acquisition Expenses and any compensatory payments
in connection with the Transactions and not included in Acquisition Expenses)
(the " _Seller Tax Deductions_ ") shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining any such indemnifiable Damages for Taxes, and shall, as necessary,
be deemed to have arisen in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) any and all
relief, loss, allowance, exemption, set-off, deduction or credit in respect of
any Taxes of the UK Company (or any of its Subsidiaries that is UK tax
resident) or relevant to the computation of any income, profits or gains for
the purposes of any Taxes of the UK Company (or any of its Subsidiaries that
is UK tax resident), and any right to repayment of Taxes of the UK Company (or
any of its Subsidiaries that is UK tax resident), that could have been
applied in a Pre-Closing Tax Period but was not so applied and is still
allowable shall be deemed to have been applied to the extent allowable for the
purposes of computing any such indemnifiable Damages for Taxes of the UK
Company (or any of its Subsidiaries that is UK tax resident).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in determining the
amount of any indemnification obligation under Section 9.1(a)(i)
(Representations and Warranties) in respect of a Post-Closing Tax Period, any
net operating loss, credit or other similar item (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Section 163(j) carryforward) that actually reduces Taxes paid
by any member of the Group in a Post-Closing Tax Period (determined on a with
and without basis) and that arose or is otherwise attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including the Seller Tax Deductions to the extent not
taken into account in computing and offsetting any indemnified Damages for
Taxes pursuant to Section 9.5(a)(i) (Mitigation)) shall be applied first to
reduce the amount of any Taxes that may be indemnifiable under Section
9.1(a)(i) (Representations and Warranties).

 



82 Section 9.6 ~~~~_Tax Treatment of Indemnification Provisions_ ~~~~. The
parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase
price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or a good faith resolution
of a Tax Contest constituting a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or a similar provision of foreign, state or local Tax
law).

 

ARTICLE X

PROCEDURES RELATING TO TAXES

Section 10.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
when due (taking into account any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to any member of the Group after
the Closing Date (including any such Tax Return that is a Pre-Closing Taxable
Period Return) or any Straddle Period Return. All reasonable out-of-
pocket third-party costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Pre-Closing Taxable Period Return shall be borne
and paid by the Seller and the Parent Securityholders. All reasonable out-of-
pocket third-party costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Straddle Period Return shall be equitably
allocated between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Parent
Securityholders, on the other hand. The Purchaser shall pay, or cause the
Group to pay, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns to the applicable
Governmental Authority.

(b) All Pre-Closing Taxable Period Returns and all Straddle Period Returns
prepared and filed pursuant to Section 10.1(a) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return to the Seller Representative
for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed with the relevant tax authority (taking into
account any applicable extensions);  _provided_ , that in the case of any
such Tax Return that is required to be filed within four (4) months following
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver such Tax Return as soon as
reasonably practicable. If the Seller Representative disputes any item on
such Tax Return, then it shall notify the Purchaser of such disputed item (or
items) and the basis for its objection no later than fifteen (15) days
following delivery of such Tax Return by the Purchaser. The Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If
the Purchaser and the Seller Representative cannot resolve any disputed item,
then the item in question shall be resolved by the Independent Auditor. The
fees and disbursements of the Independent Auditor shall be borne equally by
the Seller and the Parent Securityholders, on the one hand, and the Purchaser,
on the other hand, and the Seller Representative shall cause the Parent
Securityholders to pay any amounts required to be paid by the Parent
Securityholders pursuant to this Section 10.1(b).

 



83 (c) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Group) shall amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to any member of the Group with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, in each case, without the Seller
Representatives prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of any member of
the Group that are payable with respect to any taxable period that begins on
or before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes shall: (i) in
the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or
receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment
or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that would
be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in
the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i) above) that are
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of any
member of the Group or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, (x) any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
(including the effect of any graduated rates of tax) that is calculated on an
annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total
amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (y) the taxable
period of any subsidiary of a member of the Group, which subsidiary is a
partnership, any other "flow-through entity" or a "controlled foreign
corporation" shall be deemed to end on the Closing Date. In the case of any
Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt)
or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section
10.1 shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing
Date and prorated as provided in clause (ii) above.

Section 10.2 _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, except as provided in (b) below, the Purchaser
shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any audit,
investigation, examination, claim, dispute, claim for refund, or
administrative, judicial or other proceeding with or against a Governmental
Authority involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to any
member of the Group (any such audit, investigation, examination, claim,
dispute claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability
with respect to any member of the Group being a " _Tax Contest_ ").

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller
Representative in writing within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of written notice of the commencement of
any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes for

 



84  which the Purchaser is indemnified under Article IX. In the case of a Tax
Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a member of the Group (but not a
Straddle Period), if the Seller Representative notifies Purchaser in writing
within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such notice from Purchaser that the
Seller Representative elects to exercise its right to control the Tax Contest
as set forth in this sentence (the " _Seller Control Notice_ "), the Seller
Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax
Contest; _provided_ that (i) the Purchaser shall have the right to participate
in such Tax Contest at its own expense and (ii) the Seller Representative
shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest
that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of any member of the
Group for any Post-Closing Tax Period (or any Tax liability that is
reasonably likely to be, directly or indirectly, borne by the Purchaser
(including by reason of indemnification for such amounts under Article IX not
being available as a result of the Cap or any other limitation)) without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (it being understood and agreed
for purposes of this clause (ii) that the settlement, compromise or conceding
of any Tax Contest in a manner that, and to the extent that it, reduces a
carry forward attributable to a Seller Tax Deduction or otherwise implements
the provisions set forth in Section 9.5(c), in each case relating to an amount
of carry forward or other Tax attribute not materially in excess of the
amount of such carry forward or other Tax attribute that is reasonably
expected to be applied under Section 9.5(c) for the purposes of computing
indemnifiable Damages for Taxes, shall not be considered to affect the Tax
liability of any member of the Group for any Post-Closing Tax Period or the
Tax liability of Purchaser); _provided_ , _further_ , that (x) if the Seller
Representative informs the Purchaser in writing that it chooses not to
assume (or retain) control of the conduct of any such Tax Contest, (y) if the
Seller Representative does not timely provide such Seller Control Notice, or
if, at any time, the Seller Representative fails to defend diligently a Tax
Contest that it elected to control pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 10.2(b) (whether by failing to participate in any portion of, or
attend any scheduled meetings in connection with, such Tax Contest or by
failing to timely submit any materials in connection with such Tax Contest or
otherwise) or (z) if more than half of the Tax liability resulting from the
Tax Contest would not reasonably be expected to be recovered from the
Indemnity Escrow Account (taking into account applicable deductibles and any
other pending asserted claims), Purchaser shall have the right to assume
control of such Tax Contest (at the Seller Representatives reasonable
expense) but shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such
Tax Contest that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries for any taxable year (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date and/or liability of the Seller under
Article IX without the consent of the Seller Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding
the above provisions of this Section 10.2(b) and the proviso set forth in
Section 10.2(c), the above provisions of this Section 10.2(b) and the proviso
set forth in Section 10.2(c) shall not apply (A) after the date on which all
amounts shall have been released from Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or, solely in the
case of Tax Contests related to Taxes that are indemnifiable under Section
9.1(a)(v) (Specified Taxes) or Section 9.1(a)(vi) (Disclosed Taxes), until the
date that is thirty (30) days following the end of the Earnout Period or (B)
if the Purchaser notifies the Seller Representative in writing that the
Purchaser is waiving its right to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a)
(Seller Indemnity) with respect to Taxes imposed as a result of the
resolution of such Tax Contest.

 



85 (c) The Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control the conduct of any
Tax Contest for any Straddle Period or any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that, in the case of any such Tax Contest for a
Straddle Period, (i) the Seller Representative shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense and (ii) the Purchaser
shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest
that is reasonably likely to affect the liability of the Seller under Article
IX without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d) Neither the Seller Representative nor any of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates shall settle, compromise and/or concede any audit,
investigation, examination, claim, dispute claim for refund, or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability with respect to Specified Taxes without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

Section 10.3 _Interim Tax Covenants_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date each member of the Group shall (and the Seller
shall cause each member of the Group to): (a) prepare, in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required by
a change in applicable Law), and timely file all Tax Returns required to be
filed by it on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ "); (b)
fully and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Post-Signing Returns that
are so filed and any other Taxes of any member of the Group that are due on
or before the Closing Date and pay the Prepaid Taxes Amount; (c) promptly
notify the Purchaser of any material federal, state, local or foreign income
or franchise Tax Contest and any other Tax Contest or Action pending
or threatened against or with respect to any member of the Group in respect
of any Tax matter, including Tax liabilities and refund claims, and not
settle, abandon or compromise any such Tax matter, Tax Contest or Action
without the Purchasers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); (d) not make, change or revoke any material
election with regard to Taxes or Tax Matters or file any material amended Tax
Returns without the Purchasers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); (e) not make any significant change in any
Tax or accounting methods or systems of internal accounting controls
(including procedures with respect to the payment of accounts payable and
collection of accounts receivable), except as may be appropriate to conform to
changes in Tax laws or regulatory accounting requirements or IFRS; (f) not
enter into any "closing agreement" within the meaning of Section 7121 of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) or apply for
or request any rulings from any Tax authority or any special Tax incentives,
in each case, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and (g) terminate any and all
Tax allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements
relating to Tax matters (other than any such agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among members of the Group, or non-material
commercially reasonable indemnity, sharing or similar agreements or
arrangements where the inclusion of a Tax indemnification or allocation
provision is customary or incidental to an agreement the primary nature of
which is not Tax sharing or indemnification) (" _Tax Sharing Agreements_ ") to
which any member of the Group is a party such that, from and after the Closing
Date, no member of the Group shall have any liability thereunder.

 



86 Section 10.4 _Assistance and Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Seller Representative and the Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Group as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the
preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Tax Contest.

 

(b) The Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest involving or otherwise
relating to the Group (or their income or assets) and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Section 10.4. Any information obtained under
this Section 10.4(b) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of
any Tax Contest.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each member of the Group to, (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax and
accounting records of the Group that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods for ten
(10) years and shall hereafter provide the Seller Representative with written
notice prior to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any
portions of such records, (ii) transfer such records to the Seller
Representative and its Affiliates upon written request prior to any such
destruction, abandonment or disposition and (iii) allow the Seller
Representative and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, at
times and dates reasonably and mutually acceptable, to from time to time
inspect and review such records as the Seller Representative or its Affiliates
may deem necessary or appropriate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in all
cases, such activities are to be conducted by the Seller Representative or its
Affiliates during normal business hours and at the Seller Representatives or
its Affiliates sole expense. Any information obtained under this Section
10.4(c) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of any Tax
Contest.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall any
Person be entitled to originals or copies of (and Purchaser shall not be
required to deliver originals or copies of) or to review or inspect any Tax
Returns of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than Tax Returns or
portions thereof that relate solely to members of the Group) and (ii)
Purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive right to control any Tax Contest
in respect of Taxes of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Tax Contest solely involving the members of the Group).

 

Section 10.5 _Refunds_.

 

(a) The Seller will be entitled to any credits arising from an overpayment by
a member of the Group of a Tax for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, which credit
is in lieu of a cash refund, or refunds (including interest received thereon)
of a Tax of a member of the Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (i) first,
in each case, in the event the credit or refund directly relates to the
same or a related issue or facts that resulted in a corresponding increase in
a liability for Taxes in respect of which an indemnification obligation is
owed by Seller pursuant

 



87  to Article IX, as a credit against or offset against such indemnification
obligation and (ii) thereafter, in the case of any refunds that remain after
application of clause (i) and that are in excess of any Damages that would be
indemnifiable under Section 9.1(a) (Seller Indemnity) but for the limitations
set forth in Section 9.4(b) (Deductible) and 9.4(c) (Cap), as a cash payment,
but, in all cases, only to the extent that such credit or refund is actually
realized by any member of the Group (either as a cash refund received or as a
reduction of Taxes otherwise payable in lieu of a cash refund), reduced by any
costs (including Taxes) incurred by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including members of the Group) in connection with the receipt or accrual of
such credit or refund; _provided_ , that the Seller shall not be entitled to
any credits or refunds (i) attributable to a carryback (or use) of any loss,
deduction or other similar tax item arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii)
reflected in the amount of the Actual Trade Working Capital and specifically
identified as such or (iii) after the date on which all amounts shall have
been released from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Purchaser shall cause the
amount of any refund (or portion thereof) or the amount of any credit (or
portion thereof) to which the Seller is entitled hereunder to be allowed or
applied against the relevant Tax liability or Taxes or to be paid to the
Seller Representative promptly after it is received, as applicable.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 10.5(a), the Purchaser and its Affiliates
will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including any interest received
thereon) of any member of the Group.

Section 10.6 _Conveyance Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for and shall pay one half of any sales, use,
value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real
property transfer, or similar Taxes (but, for the absence of doubt, not any
Nonresident Capital Gains Taxes or Specified Taxes) incurred as a result of
the transfer of the Shares to Purchaser or its designated Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries hereunder (collectively, " _Conveyance Taxes_ "), provided that
Purchaser shall be responsible for any UK stamp duty on the transfer of the UK
Shares. The Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall reasonably cooperate
in the preparation of any Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of any
Conveyance Taxes. It is agreed and understood that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Conveyance Taxes required to be paid by Seller
pursuant to this Section 10.6 shall not be subject to the Deductible, or
taken into account in determining whether the Deductible has been met.

Section 10.7  _Section 338 Elections_. Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion, cause a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(g) of
the Code (and any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax law) to be
made with respect to the acquisition of the UK Company pursuant to this
Agreement (or any Subsidiary of the UK Company) but not the US Company. The
Seller Representative shall reasonably cooperate with and provide the
Purchaser with such assistance as is reasonably requested by the Purchaser to
enable the Purchaser to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338-2(e)(4).

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative;

 

(b) by the Purchaser, upon written notice to the Seller Representative of a
breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Seller or a Company set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 (Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Purchaser) not to be
satisfied and (ii) if curable, has not been cured within 60 days following the
earlier of receipt by the Purchaser of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from the Seller or a Company, as the case may be, or
receipt by the Seller or a Company of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from the Purchaser;

(c) by the Seller Representative, upon written notice to the Purchaser of a
breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 8.3 (Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Seller) not to be
satisfied and (ii) if curable, has not been cured within 60 days following the
earlier of receipt by the Seller Representative of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform from the Purchaser, as the case may be, or
receipt by the Purchaser of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from the Seller Representative;

 

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative, if there shall be
any Law or Order which is final and nonappealable preventing the consummation
of the Transactions on the terms set forth herein or that makes consummation
of the Transactions on the terms set forth herein illegal; or

 

(e) by either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative, if the Closing shall
not have occurred by April 1, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
11.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose breach of or failure to
perform any material covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder is the
principal cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
Outside Date.

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 (Termination), this Agreement shall
immediately become void, there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of the Purchaser, the Seller, the Group, any of their respective Affiliates
or their or their Affiliates respective Representatives, shareholders,
managers or partners and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall
cease, except that any such termination shall not relieve any party hereto
from any liability for any and all Damages suffered by the other party hereto
as a result of actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express
provisions in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

 



89  provisions of Section 6.3 (Pre-Closing Access and Information;
Confidentiality) (other than the first sentence thereof), this Section
11.2, Section 11.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 11.4 (Amendment) and Article

termination of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect
the obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement.

Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

parties hereto at any time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment,
modification or supplement shall be made to this Agreement that would
adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources as set forth in Section
11.4 or Section 12.6 (Parties in Interest) or 12.9 (Governing Law; Waiver of
a Jury Trial) without the consent of the Financing Sources. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Purchaser, the
Companies and the Seller Representative.

 

Section 11.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, any
party hereto entitled to the benefits thereof, may, to the extent permitted
by Law (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set

bound thereby. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any
time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or
noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than
that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 12.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto and the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Group Disclosure
Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure Letter) and the other Transaction
Documents, including the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
agreement of the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties or between any of them, with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

 



92 Section 12.5 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , that without written consent of any party hereto, the Purchaser
may assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any
of its Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of
any liability or obligation hereunder; _provided further_ , that without
written consent of any party hereto, the Seller may assign its rights under
the Escrow Agreement to the Seller Representative or an Affiliate of Seller
Representative acting on behalf of the Parent Securityholders and may direct
that any payment to which it is entitled be made to any Persons. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 12.6  _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and, except as set forth in
Section 7.6 (Indemnification of Directors and Officers), nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, except that the provisions of Sections 11.4, this
Section 12.6 and Section 12.9 shall be enforceable by each Financing Source.

Section 12.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and
to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder.

 

Section 12.8 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Except as otherwise
explicitly provided for elsewhere herein, all rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

Section 12.9 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICTING
PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION)
THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE TO BE

 



93  APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF

EVEN IF UNDER SUCH JURISDICTIONS CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW ANALYSIS,
THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SOME OTHER JURISDICTION WOULD ORDINARILY APPLY. EACH

hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or

TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING

RESPECT TO ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE TRANSACTIONS
(EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN ANOTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT), WAIVES ALL OBJECTIONS

or relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including

Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, including the Representative
Holdback Amount, or otherwise to satisfy any and all obligations or
liabilities incurred by the Seller Representative in the performance of their
duties hereunder, (v) to direct the distribution of funds, designate or engage
a paying agent to distribute funds (including any amounts paid to the Seller

95  the other Transaction Documents). The Seller, by signing this Agreement,
further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller Representative and
shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of
the Seller. All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative shall be
binding upon the Seller, and the Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Purchaser may conclusively
rely, without independent verification or investigation, upon any such
decision or action of the Seller Representative as being the binding decision
or action of the Seller, and the Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller
or any other Persons for any actions taken or omitted from being taken by them
or by the Purchaser in accordance with or reliance upon any such decision or
action of the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative shall act by a
majority in interest of Oak Hill Capital Partners III, L.P. and Oak Hill
Capital Management Partners III, L.P. The Seller Representative shall have no
duties or obligations to the Seller hereunder, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

(b) By signing this Agreement, the Seller hereby, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Representative and its partners, managers,
officers, agents and other Representatives against all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by such
Persons in connection with any Action to which the Seller Representative or
such other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that it is or was
acting as the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
other than as a result of the Seller Representatives bad faith or willful
misconduct.

(c) Neither the Seller Representative nor any of its members, managers,
officers, agents or other Representatives shall incur any liability to the
Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons for any reason to
consummate the Transactions or relating to the performance of their duties
hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting bad faith or willful
misconduct. The Seller Representative and its members, managers, officers,
agents and other Representatives and their respective Affiliates shall have no
liability in respect of any Action brought against such Persons by the
Seller, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, unless such Persons took or
omitted taking any action in bad faith or as result of willful misconduct.

(d) The Seller Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to recover from any amounts withheld by the Seller Representative, including
without limitation, the Representative Holdback Amount, its reasonable out of
pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder (the "
_Charges_ "). The Seller will be obligated to pay any Charges in excess of the
Representative Holdback Amount to the Seller Representative.

 

(e) In furtherance of, and without limiting any rights of the Seller
Representative set forth in, Sections 12.13(a)(iv), 12.13(a)(v) and 12.13(d),
the Seller Representative shall have the right and the Seller hereby
authorizes the Seller Representative, to use the Representative Holdback
Amount to satisfy potential future obligations of the Seller and expenses
incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with performing its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The
Representative Holdback Amount shall be retained by the Seller Representative
until such time as the Seller Representative shall determine, and, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, the balance of the

 



96  Representative Holdback Amount, if any, shall be delivered by the Seller
Representative to the Parent Securityholders on behalf of the Seller. The
Seller will not receive any interest or earnings on the Representative
Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Seller
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Seller Representative will not be liable for
any loss of principal of the Representative Holdback Amount other than as a
result of its bad faith or willful misconduct. The Representative Holdback
Amount shall be held in an FDIC-insured account or accounts at a nationally
recognized financial institution.

(f) In the event that the Seller Representative becomes unable or unwilling to
continue in its capacity as Seller Representative, or if the Seller
Representative resigns as the Seller Representative, the Seller may by written
consent appoint a new representative as the Seller Representative. Notice and
a copy of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing
the signature of the Seller must be delivered to the Purchaser. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by the Purchaser.

 

Section 12.14 _Provision With Respect to Legal Representation_. Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Macfarlanes LLP and in-house lawyers of the
Seller Representative and its Affiliates have represented the Seller, the
Parent Securityholders and the Group in connection with the Transactions. All
of the parties recognize the community of interest that exists and will
continue to exist until the Closing, and the parties agree that such community
of interest should continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically,
the parties agree that (a) the Purchaser shall not, and from and after
the Closing shall cause any member of the Group not to, seek to have Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Macfarlanes LLP or any in-house lawyer
of the Seller Representative or its Affiliates which has represented the
Seller, the Parent Securityholders and the Group in connection with the
Transactions disqualified from representing the Seller or the Parent
Securityholders in any dispute (whether in contract or tort) that may arise
between the Seller or the Parent Securityholders, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser or, from and after the Closing, any member of the Group, on the
other, based upon, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents or
any of the Transactions in whole or in part, and (b) in connection with any
dispute that may arise between the Seller, the Parent Securityholders and
their respective successors, shareholders, partners, members, trustees and
Representatives on the one hand, and the Purchaser or, from and after the
Closing, the members of the Group and their respective successors,
shareholders, partners, members, trustees and Representatives, on the other,
the Seller and the Parent Securityholders (and not the Group) will have the
right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client privilege that
may apply to any communications between any member of the Group and Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Macfarlanes LLP or any in-house lawyer
of the Seller Representative or its Affiliates which has represented the
Seller, the Parent Securityholders and the Group in connection with the
Transactions that occurred on or prior to the Closing, and any such
communications (whether in written form or email) in the possession of any
member of the Group shall not be admissible in any dispute, shall be held
separately and not disclosed to any other Person, shall be returned to the
Seller Representative upon request and shall not be used by the Purchaser for
any purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between the Purchaser or any member of the Group, on
the one hand, and a third party that is not a Seller Affiliated Person, on the
other hand, the Purchaser or the member of the Group, as applicable, may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party.

 



97 Section 12.15 _Purchaser Guarantee_. The Purchaser shall cause the UK
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and hereby
guarantees the payment and performance of any and all obligations of the UK
Purchaser under this Agreement.
