shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock

Company may reasonably agree), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates and agreements evidencing Company

the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect thereto, require the owner of

affidavit, indemnity, surety bond or other documentation
reasonably satisfactory to the Parents.

Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(a) and remain undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Company RSUs as of the first anniversary of the
date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to the Parents
upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company RSUs
who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or
Company RSU Agreements in accordance with this Section 1.9 shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for satisfaction of their claims for
the cash amounts payable in accordance with Section 1.5(a) or 1.6(a), as
applicable, without interest.

  

### **(c) **None of the Parents, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Person with respect to any cash amounts properly
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

### **(d) **The Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent and the Parents
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable under this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock and any
Company RSUs any amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code or any other applicable Law. Any withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
holder of Company Common Stock or Company RSUs, as applicable.

  

## **1.10. Appraisal Rights.**

  

### **(a) **Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that have not
been voted in favor of (or consented to) adoption of this Agreement, and with
respect to which a demand for payment and appraisal has been properly made
and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
**_"Dissenting Shares"_** ), shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.5(a), but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL; _provided_ that if a holder of
Dissenting Shares (a ** _"Dissenting Stockholder"_** ) shall have failed to
perfect or withdraws or loses such holders right to payment and appraisal or
becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal then such holders
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be
deemed to have automatically been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.5(a).

  

### **(b) **The Company shall give the Parents (i) prompt written notice of
any written demands for dissenters rights of any Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company which relate to rights to be
paid "fair value" for Dissenting Shares, as

        

### provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for dissenters rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Parents (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make or agree to make any payment
with respect to any demands for dissenters rights or offer to settle or
settle or approve any withdrawals of any such demands.

  

## **1.11. Further Action.** If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to
vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporation with full right, title,
interest in and possession of and to all rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, assets and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and its directors and officers (including Board members, as
applicable) shall take such action, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.

party to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,

by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of the Parents or, effective as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take
or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of
the Parents, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any order
issued pursuant to any Antitrust Law, which would have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the End Date.

  

## **5.3. Employee Benefits.**

  

### **(a) **The Parents agree that from and after the Effective Time, the
Parents, the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries shall

following the Closing Date, the employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the " ** _Company Employees_** ") will be
provided with, at a minimum (i) base salary and bonus opportunities which are
no less than the base salary and bonus opportunities provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) retirement and welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding equity and
equity based benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those

limit the Parents, the Company or any Company Subsidiary from discharging
Company Employees in accordance with applicable Law in the exercise of their
good faith business judgment in the operation of the business, including
discharging employees in connection with business restructurings and
reorganizations, store closings, individual or group performance, and the

### **(b) **For eligibility and vesting purposes under the employee benefit

participated immediately before the Effective Time (the **_"New Plans"_** ),
each Company Employee shall be (to the extent available at commercially
reasonable cost) credited with his or her years of service with the Company
or any Company Subsidiary before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service for purposes of vesting and eligibility (but not benefit
accrual) under any similar Company Plans. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee who is entitled
to participate in the Old Plans (defined below) shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans; (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee (but only if and to the extent such
benefits were provided under the Old Plans to such Company Employee),

        

### the Parents shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and the Parents shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the **_"Old Plans"_** ) ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as provided in Section 5.3(a), the Parents, Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to provide any employee benefit plan or
any particular employee benefit to any Company Employee and (iii) such
participants shall participate in the New Plans on terms no less favorable
than those offered by the Parents to their similarly situated employees,
directors, and officers. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Parents or any of
their subsidiaries may continue one or more of the Old Plans, in which case
the Parents and their subsidiaries shall have satisfied their obligations
hereunder with respect to the benefits so provided.

  

### **(c) **Each Company Employee shall be given credit for, and allowed to
take as vacation days, under the vacation policy of the Parents, the number
of vacation days accrued but not used by such Company Employee during
employment with Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date.

  

### **(d) **On and after the Effective Time, the Parents or any subsidiary
shall provide applicable notices and continuing health coverage required by
Code section 4980B and ERISA sections 601-608 and the regulations thereunder
(" ** _COBRA_** ") for employees and former employees (and their dependents)

### **(e) **Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in this
Section 5.3, the Parents, Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have no
obligation to provide any employee benefit plan or any particular employee
benefit to any Company Employee. Nothing contained herein, express or
implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the
Parents or the Companys ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time, (iii) is intended to
confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is
intended to confer upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or
dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  

### **(f) **The Parents hereby acknowledge that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change of control" under
the Company Plans, if any, and the terms of employment-related agreements, as
applicable, in each case, as specifically set forth in Part 5.3(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

  

### **(g) **Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3, neither the
Parents nor their Affiliates nor Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
obliged to continue any

inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the Company or the Company
Subsidiary to be unable to comply with or satisfy by the Closing any material
covenant, obligation, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement any exhibit or schedule hereto; _provided_ ,

representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement or to satisfy any
condition or otherwise affect the remedies available to the Parents and
Merger Sub hereunder. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to give prompt notice to the Parents of any event or state of facts before
the Closing that has or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Any such notification by the Company shall not be deemed to amend the
schedules hereto for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth

### **(b) **The Parents shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event before the Closing which
occurrence or failure causes the Parents to be unable to comply with or
satisfy by the Closing any material covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or to satisfy any condition.

  

## **5.6. Disclosure.** The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release the text of which shall be agreed to by each
of the Parents and the Company.  Thereafter, each of the Parents and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer
quotation system; provided that, in the case of any such requirement, to the
extent possible, the party required to issue such release or make such
statement shall confer with the other party concerning the timing and content
of any announcement before it is release to the public. The Parents and the
Company acknowledge that they have previously executed the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. All information contained (i) herein, (ii) in the Disclosure Schedule,
or (iii) delivered to the Parents or any of their authorized representatives

foregoing, each of the Company, the Parents and Merger Sub may make any
disclosures which are consistent with prior releases or announcements made in

United States of America (including, without limitation, Section 203 of the
DGCL) shall become applicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Board and the Company, subject to Section 4.3, shall grant such
approvals and take such actions

        

## as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such
takeover provision on the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## **5.8. Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts.** Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

high yield debt securities need not be issued by the Company;

  

#### **(iii) **as promptly as practicable, furnish the Parents and Merger
Sub and their Debt Financing sources with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by the Parents in order to consummate the Debt Financing, including

Information_** ");

#### Company, legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, title

from the Companys current outside legal counsel with respect to such matters

#### **(v) **provide monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) in
the form and within the time period following the end of the month in which

#### **(ix) **to the extent the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment requires actions by or cooperation of the Company

satisfying the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment which
can be satisfied as of a date prior to the closing date with respect to the
Debt Financing; and

  

#### **(x) **take all actions necessary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof, together with the cash of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to be made available to the Company
on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger;

  

 _provided_ , however, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Company will periodically
update the Required Financial Information to be included in an offering
document to be used in connection with such Debt Financing in order to ensure
that such Required Financial Information does not contain any
untrue statement of a

        

material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained there in, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or
obligation to the lenders or prospective lenders in connection with the
Financing (or any replacements thereof) unless otherwise indemnified by the
Parents or Merger Sub in connection therewith prior to the Effective Time.

  

## **5.10. ****Shareholder Litigation**.  Subject to a customary joint
defense agreement, the Company shall give the Parents the opportunity to
participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , however, nothing
herein shall require either party to take any action that its outside counsel
reasonably concludes would jeopardize the work product privilege or the
attorney-client privilege. The Company shall not enter into any settlement
of such litigation without the Parents prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

## **5.11. ****Treatment of Notes.**

  

### **(a) **As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any
written request from the Parents, the Company shall commence an offer to
purchase, and related consent solicitation with respect to, all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 101/2% Senior Discount Notes
due 2012 of the Company (the " ** _Notes_** ") on the terms and conditions
specified by the Parents (the " ** _Debt Offer_** "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the closing of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the
completion of the Merger and otherwise shall be in compliance with all
applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. The Company and the Parents
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by the other in
connection with the Debt Offer. If requested by the Parents in writing, in
lieu of the Company commencing the Debt Offer for such Notes (or in addition
thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture and
supplemental indentures governing the Notes (collectively, the " **
_Indenture_** ") take actions reasonably requested by the Parents that are
reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance
of the Notes pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture, and
shall satisfy and/or discharge and/or defease, as applicable, the Notes in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture at the Effective Time, provided
that to the extent that any action described above can be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and provided,
further, that prior to the Company being required to take any of the actions
described above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective
Time, prior to the Closing, Merger Sub shall irrevocably deposit, or shall
cause to be irrevocably deposited with the trustee under the Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such satisfaction or discharge or defeasance.

### **(b) **The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the
consent solicitation expiration date in connection with the Debt Offer,
assuming the requisite consents are received, the Company shall (and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee to) execute a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture, which supplemental indenture shall
implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter
of transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the " ** _Offer
Documents_** ") and shall become operative only concurrently with the
Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer Documents
and this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer). Concurrently
with the Effective Time, the Parents shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been
properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and
in accordance with the Debt Offer using funds provided by or at the direction
of the Parents.

  

### **(c) **The Parents shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the Offer
Documents. The Parents and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including
all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes
in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review of,
and comment by, the Company and the Parents and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them prior to their mailing, distribution or execution,
as applicable. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer any
information should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, or the Parents, on the other hand, which information should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by the Parents describing
such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the
holders of the Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at
the reasonable direction of the Parents, take the form of a filing of a
Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.11(c), the Company shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection
with the Debt Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof.

  

## **5.12. ****Termination of Certain Indebtedness.**

  

### **(a) **The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
to the Parents at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date payoff
letters from third-party lenders and trustees, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Parents, with respect to the indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries identified on Section 5.12(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule and any other indebtedness specified by the Parents to
the Company no later than 10 days prior to the Closing.

  

### **(b) **On the Closing Date, subject to the Parents making available
necessary funds to do so, the Company shall and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to

        

### permanently (i) terminate the credit facilities requested by the Parents
to be so terminated, if and to the extent such facilities are either
identified on Section 5.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule or specified by the
Parents to the Company no later than five days prior to Closing, and all
related Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party,
and (ii) to the extent the related facility is terminated pursuant to this
Section 5.12, release any Liens on its assets relating to those facilities.

  

## **5.13. ****Stock Exchange Listing; De-Registration. **Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws,
including the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (a) to ensure that the
Company Common Stock remains listed on the NYSE at all times prior to the
Effective Date and that the Company remains in compliance in all material
respects with the rules and regulations of the NYSE, and (b) to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the
NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Date.

  

## **5.14. ****Subsequent Filings. **Until the Closing Date, the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file or furnish with or to
the SEC each form, report and other document required to be filed or
furnished (as applicable) by the Company under the Exchange Act. As of their
respective dates, no form, report or other document filed by the Company with
the SEC after the date hereof pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange
Act shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company included in such forms, reports
and other documents shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and shall
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of
their operations and changes in financial position for the periods then
ended.

## **9.7. Severability; Specific Performance.**

  

### **(a) **Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or

unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to
it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business

contrary, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take such actions as

Letter (January 12, 1999).
