_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

4.1. _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger, without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") (excluding any Shares granted in the form of Company Restricted
Shares, Company Performance Shares, or Company Other Awards, which will be

3

    

 with _Section_ __ _ 4.3_) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, in each case not held on behalf of third
parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_
")) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$25.35 per Share (as may be reduced pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(viii)_, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, the
Shares (excluding any Shares granted in the form of Company Restricted
Shares, Company Performance Shares, or Company Other Awards, which will be
treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.3_) will cease to be outstanding,
will be cancelled, and will cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and
thereafter each certificate formerly representing any Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) (each, a " _Stock Certificate_ ") and each book entry account
formerly representing any non-certificated Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) (each, a " _Book Entry Share_ ") will thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share will cease to be
outstanding, will be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor,
and will cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into and become one share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2. _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
serve as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") and will enter into an agreement with
the Paying Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying
Agents responsibilities with respect to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent or
Merger Sub will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to provide all funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (all cash deposited with the Paying Agent
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
will not be used for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for
in this Agreement. Pending its disbursement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 4.2_, the Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, if so
directed by Parent or Merger Sub. Any such investment, if made, must be made
in (i) short-term direct obligations of the U.S., (ii) short-term obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the U.S. is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated
the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Financial Services LLC or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (a " _Permitted Investment_ "). Any interest and other income
resulting from investment of the

 



4

    

 Payment Fund will be a part of the Payment Fund. Subject to _Section_ __ _
4.2(e)_ ( _Termination of Payment Fund_ ), Parent or Merger Sub will or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of
Merger Consideration under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the Payment Fund will diminish the rights of any
holder of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein.

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event within two Business
Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Shares (or, in the case of "street-holders,"
deliver to The Depository Trust Company) (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time: (A) a notice advising such
holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a letter of transmittal, in
customary form, specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss
and title will pass, only upon delivery of the Stock Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Stock Certificates as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares), such materials to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (C) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of the Stock Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) or
the Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration that such holders are entitled to pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Stock Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Stock Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_) or Book Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Stock
Certificates, the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, or, in the case of
Book Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required, the holder of such Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares will solely be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to each such holder as promptly
as practicable, a check in the amount of cash that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_.

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
surrender of the Shares.

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Stock
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Stock Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock

 



5

    

 transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book Entry Shares will only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book Entry Shares are registered in the stock
transfer books of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(v) Parent will pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the surrender of Stock Certificates and Book Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares will be cancelled and exchanged for a check
in the amount of cash that the holder thereof has the right to receive
therefor pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Payment Fund) that remains unclaimed
by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Stock Certificates and Book
Entry Shares by the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand by Parent. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article IV_ will look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration upon delivery of the Stock
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Stock Certificates as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar
Laws. If any Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the time that such Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares would escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental
Authority, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates_. In the event any Stock
Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount and upon such
reasonable terms as may be reasonably required by Parent to indemnify Parent
and the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Stock Certificate a check in the amount equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration.

4.3. _Treatment and Payment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Effective as of five Business Days prior to, and
conditional upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, each holder of an
outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Stock Plan (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_) intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an "
_Incentive Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, will be entitled to
exercise such Incentive Stock Option in full by providing the Company with a
notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan and related award
agreement. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not exercised in
accordance with the prior sentence, whether vested or unvested, will,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Company Option
to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the

Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time  _multiplied by_ (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option, less any

thereof, accelerate in full and be cancelled and will only entitle the holder
of such Company Restricted Share to receive (without interest), as soon as

the holder thereof, immediately vest on a prorated basis as set forth in
Section 4.3(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, and (B) each vested Company
Performance Share will only entitle the holder of such Company Performance
Share to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after
the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company Performance Share based on the higher of
target performance and the actual level of performance through the Effective
Time, as reasonably determined in good faith by the compensation committee of
the Company Board, _multiplied by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment;
_provided_ _that_ with respect to any Company Performance Shares that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty

 



7

    

 under Section 409A of the Code, such payment will be made at the earliest
time permitted under the Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will
not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. At the Effective
Time, (A) each outstanding performance-based cash award (each, a " _Company
Long-Term Incentive Cash Award_ ") under the Companys long-term incentive
plans, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, immediately vest on a
prorated basis as set forth in Section 4.3(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, and
(B) each vested Company Long-Term Incentive Cash Award will only entitle the
holder of such Company Long-Term Incentive Cash Award to receive (without
interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), an
amount in cash equal to the higher of target performance and the actual level
of performance for such Company Long-Term Incentive Cash Award through the

committee of the Company Board; _provided_ _that_ with respect to any Company
Long-Term Incentive Cash Award that constitutes a nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is not permitted to
be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code, such payment will be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable long-term incentive plan and award agreement
that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Deferred Compensation Plans for Nonemployee Directors_. At the Effective
Time, each hypothetical Share credited to the Account (as defined in the

2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors, the "
_Director Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") of each participant in the Director
Deferred Compensation Plans (each hypothetical Share, a " _Company Other
Award_ "), will, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Other Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time  _multiplied by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, which resulting amount
will become payable to such participant in accordance with the same terms,
conditions and deferral elections as applied to such Company Other Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the

to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

complete copy of each fully executed Commitment Letter as in effect on date of
this Agreement has been provided to the Company. A true, correct and complete
copy of each fee letter and engagement letter related to the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on date of this Agreement has been provided to the
Company, except that the fees and other commercially sensitive information

respect, and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of

precedent to the obligation of the Equity Financing Sources to provide the
Equity Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Equity Financing
Sources to reduce the total amount of Equity Financing. As of date of this
Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing applicable to it will not be satisfied on a timely
basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the date on
which the Closing should occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries will, and the Company
will instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and
other advisors or representatives (a Persons directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or

any existing agreement) that would prevent the Company or any Subsidiary or
their respective representatives from complying with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
or amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to the Company (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may amend or grant
any waiver or release under any provision contained in any standstill or
similar agreement that would prohibit the other party thereto from
communicating with the Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
submitting an Acquisition Proposal to the Company if, and only if,
the Company Board, or any duly authorized committee thereof, determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure
to amend or grant any waiver or release under any such standstill or similar
agreement would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, the Company and its
Representatives may, in response to the receipt of a written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ in
any material respect, take the actions described in clause _(ii)_ above (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, such actions shall not be a breach of clauses
_(i)_ and _(iii)_ above) in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company or its Representatives after the date of this
Agreement that is not withdrawn if (but only if): (A) the Company Board, or
any duly authorized committee thereof, has determined in good faith based on
the information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or may reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, (B) the Company gives Parent written notice that the
Company Board or any duly authorized committee thereof has made the
determination contemplated by clause _(A)_ above, such notice to include
the information set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)_ and (C) the Company

Representatives only after such Person has executed a confidentiality
agreement on terms relating to confidentiality that, taken as a whole, are not
less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); it
being understood that such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not
prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal; and
contemporaneously discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such
non-public information to Parent to the extent not previously disclosed or
provided to Parent.

 



45

    

(b) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, the Company Board and
each committee thereof will not:

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation (it being understood that the Company Board may take no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that is structured as a
tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business on the tenth
Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an
adverse modification);

 

(ii) adopt, approve, or recommend (or publicly propose or resolve to adopt,
approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal; 

(iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

_provided_ , that, if any disclosure or other action taken pursuant to this
clause _(iv)_ includes a Change of Recommendation, such action or disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation (it being understood that
any public statement that includes only factual statements shall not be a
statement inconsistent with the Company Recommendation); or

 

(v) in the event an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or
publicly disclosed, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation following a
written request by Parent to do so (provided that the Company Board shall only
be required to make such reaffirmation two times for any specific Acquisition
Proposal (but if such Acquisition Proposal is materially amended, modified or
supplemented, any reaffirmation by the Company Board prior to such material
amendment, modification or supplement shall be disregarded for purposes of
this proviso)), on or prior to the later of the fifth Business Day after the
delivery of such request by Parent and ten Business Days following public
announcement or disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal, but in any event, at
least two Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) (any action in the foregoing clauses
_(i)_ - _(v)_ a " _Change of Recommendation_ ".

Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that (a) the resolution of the Company
Board adopting the Company Recommendation was not unanimous, (b) the Proxy
Statement will contain the reasons that directors did not vote in favor of
said resolution as of the date of its adoption and (c) the foregoing in and
of themselves shall not constitute a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ of this
Agreement.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, the
Company Board, or any duly authorized committee thereof, may effect a Change
of Recommendation in connection with or relating to a Superior Proposal or
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_ if (but only if) (v) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is received by
the Company

 or its Representatives after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
which did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ in any
material respect and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn and is
reflected in a written definitive agreement that would be binding, subject to
the terms and conditions of such written definitive agreement, on the
applicable party if executed and delivered by the Company following
termination of this Agreement, (w) the Company Board, or a duly authorized
committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board, or committee
thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation or authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, (x) the Company
provides Parent with at least 96 hours written notice stating that the Company
will effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_ or the Company Board will authorize the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ at the expiration of such 96
hour period, which notice shall (A) provide the identity of the Person making
the Superior Proposal and (B) attach the most current draft of any proposed
definitive agreement and any ancillary documents with respect to such Superior
Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any change to the financial terms or
any other material changes to the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice to be delivered by the Company to
Parent and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this paragraph of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ ( _provided_ that
references to the 96 hour period above shall be deemed to refer to a two
Business Day period ( _provided_ , that, for purposes of this paragraph, if
the Company delivers written notice prior to 8:00 a.m. New York City time on a
Business Day, such Business Day shall be included as one Business Day in such
two Business Day period) in connection with the delivery of any such new
notice), (y) during the period described in clause _(x)_ , the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make any revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would
permit the Company Board or any duly authorized committee thereof not to
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with the Superior Proposal or
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_, and (z) following the 96 hour period described in clause _(x)_ (or
two Business Day period, as applicable), the Company Board, or a committee
thereof, again determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or
modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent has
committed in writing prior to the expiration of such 96 hour period (or two
Business Day period, as applicable) and that are reflected in a written
definitive agreement that would be binding on Parent if executed and delivered
by the Company, that the Superior Proposal continues to (A) be reflected in a
written definitive agreement that would be binding, subject to the terms and
conditions of such written definitive agreement, on the applicable Person
making the Superior Proposal, if executed and delivered by the Company and (B)
constitute a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation or authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 



47

    

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, the
Company Board, or any duly authorized committee thereof, may take the actions
described in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(iii)_,
in response to an Intervening Event, if (but only if): (w) the Company Board,
or duly authorized committee thereof determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation
with respect to such development or change in circumstances would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, (x) the Company
provides Parent with at least 96 hours written notice stating that the Company
will effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_ at the expiration of such 96 hour period, which notice shall describe
in reasonable detail such Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
subsequent development or change in circumstances shall require a new written
notice to be delivered by the Company to Parent and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the provisions of this paragraph ( _provided_
that references to the 96 hour period above shall be deemed to refer to a two
Business Day period in connection with the delivery of any such notice (
_provided_ , that, for purposes of this paragraph, if the Company delivers
written notice prior to 8:00 a.m. New York City time on a Business Day, such
Business Day shall be included as one Business Day in such two Business Day
period)), (y) during the period described in clause _(x)_ , the Company and
its Representatives negotiate in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to negotiate) any revisions to this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board or any duly authorized committee thereof to determinate that the
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Intervening
Event would not be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law, and (z) following the 96 hour period described in clause _(x)_ (or two
Business Day period, as applicable), the Company Board, or committee thereof,
again determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking
into account any adjustment or modification to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing prior to the
expiration of such 96 hour period (or two Business Day period, as applicable)
and that are reflected in a written definitive agreement that would be binding
on Parent if executed and delivered by the Company, that the failure to effect
a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

(c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board, or any duly authorized
committee thereof, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to the Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the Stockholders); _provided_ , that, in each case, if any
such any such action or disclosure taken pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)_ includes a Change of Recommendation, such action or disclosure shall
be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation for all purposes under this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Existing Discussions_. Following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers and
directors and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) promptly terminate access to any electronic data room to any Person (and
such Persons Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential

 



48

    

 Acquisition Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and request such Person to return or destroy all confidential
information in the possession of such Person or its Representatives, and
(iii) take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities
referred to in clause _(i)_ hereof of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

(e) _Notice_. The Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
notify Parent orally and in writing if any proposals or offers with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal are received by or a request to any Company or its
Subsidiaries for any non-public information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal or such other proposal or offer (including an unredacted
copy of an Acquisition Proposal or such other proposal or offer or, where such
Acquisition Proposal, offer or proposal is not in writing, a description of
the material terms thereof, and the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, offer or proposal). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the material status and
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, offer or proposal (including any
material amendments thereto) and any material changes to the status of any
such discussions or negotiations or material decisions related thereto,
including, in each case, by promptly providing Parent copies of any material
correspondence, proposals, indications of interest and draft agreements
relating to such Acquisition Proposal, offer or proposal.

 

7.3. _Proxy Statement Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy
statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary form. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries to the
Company and provide such other assistance and information as may be reasonably
requested by the Company or the Companys outside legal counsel in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement.

(i) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any other Governmental Authority with respect to, or
any request from the SEC or any other Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to, the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. If the Company receives either comments from the SEC
on the preliminary Proxy Statement or notice from the SEC that it will review
the preliminary Proxy Statement, then, in either case, each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (1) to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement and
(2) to have the SEC advise the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. If the Company
receives either (A) comments from the SEC on the preliminary Proxy Statement
or (B) notice from the

 



49

    

 SEC that it will not review the preliminary Proxy Statement, then, in either
case, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the
SEC and cause such definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later
than ten Business Days, after the SEC advises the Company that the SEC has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement.

 

(ii) Unless the Company Board has made a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the Company shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement filed in preliminary form and in the
Proxy Statement filed in definitive form.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC, responding to any comment from the
SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements
to, the Proxy Statement or mailing the Proxy Statement in definitive form to
Stockholders, the Company shall (1) provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
consider in good faith any of Parents comments thereon, and (2) to the extent
reasonably practicable, permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate
in all substantive communications with the SEC (including all substantive
meetings and telephone conferences) relating to the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) None of the information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of filing with the SEC or mailing to
the Stockholders, include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. If, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
any event occurs with respect to Parent, or any change occurs with respect to
other information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, that is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company
of such event or change, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and, as
required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the Stockholders.

 

(d) The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that the Proxy
Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and subject to
the obligations of Parent under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ shall not include at
the date of filing with the SEC or mailing to the Stockholders
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation with respect to information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement. If, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any event
occurs with respect to the

 



50

    

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to
other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, that is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of such event or change, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and,
as required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to the Stockholders.

 

7.4. _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
the SEC advises the Company that the SEC will not review the Proxy Statement

applicable Law and its Organizational Documents, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of the Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_
"), for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote and will,
subject to there being a quorum, cause such vote to be taken, and will not

best efforts to (i) solicit proxies from the Stockholders in favor of approval
of the Merger and (ii) obtain the Requisite Stockholder Vote.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_, the
Company may delay convening, postpone, recess or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting:

(i) with Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);

(ii) after consultation with Parent, (A) due to the absence of a quorum or
(B) to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of such delay, postponement
or adjournment, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of Shares for the Requisite Stockholder Vote to be received at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to delay convening,
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than 10 Business
Days in the aggregate pursuant to this clause _(ii)_ ; or

(iii) after consultation with Parent, to allow reasonable additional time
for (1) the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and (2) such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 



51

    

(c) In the event that the Company Board delivers a notice in accordance with

may request in writing that the Company postpone the Company Stockholders

postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
Parents direction.

and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted or

 



52

of its Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions.

(d) In furtherance of, and without limiting the generality of, the covenants
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, if any objections are asserted with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions under the HSR Act, any
applicable antitrust, competition or merger control Laws promulgated by any
Governmental Authority (together with the HSR Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
or any other applicable Law, or if any lawsuit or other proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted),
including any proceeding by a private party, challenging the Merger and the
other Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or that would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions, Parent and the Company will (and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) resolve any such objections and (ii) contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that results from such action or proceeding and that prohibits,

or before the Outside Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent will take
all such further action as may be necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law, or any other applicable Law so as to

Corporation and its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to operate or retain any of the business, assets or properties of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required
to become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order
to sell, divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, operations
or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on or
otherwise applicable to the Company only from and after the Effective Time in
the event that the Closing occurs.

 



53

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ (including the reasonable best efforts
standard) shall not be construed to (i) (A) require Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or (B) permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the

the businesses, assets or properties of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries, or (ii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates to agree or
consent to any order, action or regulatory condition of any Governmental
Authority with respect to clauses _(i)(A)_ or _(i)(B)_ which, in each case of
_(i)_ and _(ii)_ , individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company shall take or commit or agree to
take, effective at Closing (or such other time after the Closing as requested
by Parent), any actions (including actions contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii)

Antitrust Laws necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

(f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ (including the reasonable best efforts standard)
shall not be construed to require Parent or its Affiliates (other than with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries), and except as expressly provided
in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e)_, the Company and its Subsidiaries, to (i) sell,
divest, dispose of or otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise), any of the business, assets or properties of Parent or
any of its Affiliates (other than with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (ii) otherwise take or commit to take actions that would
limit Parent and its Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to operate or retain any of the business, assets or properties of
Parent or its Affiliates, other than in each case with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

7.6. _Information; Access and Reports_.

(a) During the Interim Period, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
applicable Laws, and the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and
solely for purposes of furthering the Merger and the other Transactions, the
Company and Parent will (and will cause its respective Subsidiaries to), upon
reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all reasonably
requested information in its possession concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers, and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions.

(b) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, applicable Laws, and the other
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, and solely for purposes of

authorized representatives and the Financing Sources reasonable access, during
normal business hours 

 



54

    

 throughout the Interim Period, to its employees, counsel, properties, books,
contracts, and records and, during such period, furnish promptly to Parent
such information in its possession concerning its business, properties, and
personnel as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ , _however_ , no
investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company in
_Article V_. The foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ and the
last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ will not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to permit any access to any of its employees, properties, books,
contracts, and records or its business, properties, and personnel, or to
permit any inspection, review, sampling, or audit, or to disclose or otherwise
make available any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, would (i) unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of a
third party or violate any obligations of confidentiality of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a third party if the Company will have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
disclosure ( _provided_ _that_ the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to allow for access or disclosure to the extent that does not result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets or violation of the confidentiality
obligations) or (iii) be expected to cause the loss or waiver of
the protection of any attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, or
other relevant legal privilege ( _provided_ _that_ the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for access or disclosure to the
extent that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product, or other relevant legal privilege). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and its Representatives will not be permitted to perform
any on-site procedures (including an on-site environmental or other study or
any sampling) with respect to any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries
without the Companys prior written consent, which may be withheld in the
Companys sole and absolute discretion. All requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ must be directed to the executive
officer or other Person designated by the Company. All information exchanged
or made available will be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to

occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of this
Agreement in favor of the Indemnified Parties, as provided in the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents or in any agreement that is

its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor such obligations in accordance with
their terms to the maximum extent that the Company or applicable Subsidiary

 



58

    

 would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them under applicable Laws.
In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause
the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are
at least as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions
contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company and such
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and
during such six-year period, such provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the

unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or more insurance carriers
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of
the date of this Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the insureds as the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Merger and the other
Transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to continue
to maintain in effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the
Tail Period with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement and from an insurance
carrier with an AM Best rating that is the same or better than the AM Best
rating of the Companys existing insurance carrier for DandO Insurance;
_provided_ _that_ in no event will the premium of such insurance coverage
exceed 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such
purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a premium not
exceeding such amount.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ will survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and nothing in this Agreement will affect any
indemnification rights that any such Indemnified Party may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
contract or any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

 



59

respective Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns)
consolidates or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person,
then in each case proper provision will be made so that the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable),
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will also assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

of  _Section_ __ _ 7.13(b)_), the Company and the Company Board will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute on such

as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Merger and the other Transactions by each director or officer who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws.

consent.

other than as a result of the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will

within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt by the Company) notify Parent of
the receipt of a complaint in any stockholder litigation arising from this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions that is brought against the
Company, its executive officers or members of the Company Board ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation. Without limiting the preceding sentence,
the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense,

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not
offer to make or make any payment with respect to any Transaction Litigation
or to enter into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to
any Transaction Litigation.

 

7.15. _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain a duly executed pay-off letter dated on or about the
Closing Date from the agent under each of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and

or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in breach or

 



61

    

 default) by Parent, Merger Sub, or to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub,
any party to either Commitment Letter or other definitive agreements with
respect thereto (such definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letter, " _Debt_ _Documents_ "), in
each case, which would reasonably be expected to delay or impair the Closing
or make funding less likely to occur on or before the Closing, (ii) if and
when Parent or Merger Sub receives notice that any portion of the Financing
contemplated by either Commitment Letter is not reasonably expected to be
available for the Financing Purposes, (iii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any party to either Commitment

Debt Document. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Companys prior
written consent, permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to either Commitment Letter if such amendment,

in the case of the Debt Financing, such reduction is matched with (i) an
equal increase of the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letter or
(ii) an equal increase in a committed commercial mortgage backed security,

replacement financing, the " _Replacement Financing_ "); _provided_ , that,
any such Replacement Financing shall not impose new or additional conditions
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing (unless such new or additional conditions or expanded, amended
or modified conditions could not be reasonably expected to (1) delay or
prevent the Closing, (2) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur, or (3) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against other parties with respect to the Financing), (C) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing (unless such new or additional
conditions or expanded, amended or modified conditions could not

timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur, or (3) adversely affect the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties with respect to the
Financing) or (D) otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely affect (other
than a _de minimis_ manner) the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may amend, supplement, modify or waive any terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and/or the Debt Documents with respect thereto without the consent of

long as such reduction is matched with an equal increase of the Equity
Financing under the Equity Commitment Letter or is matched with Replacement
Financing, (2) correct typographical errors, (3) add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (by assignment or
otherwise) subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (4)

obtained, alternative financing, including from alternative sources, in an
amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Financing ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such Financing Failure Event, on (i) economic terms taken as a
whole and (ii) other terms, in each case, that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any flex terms applicable thereto) and the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ and the Financing Sources Protection
Provisions shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_, _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and the Financing
Sources Protection Provisions, all references to the Financing shall be
deemed to include such Alternative Financing and any Replacement Financing,
all references to Debt Documents shall include the applicable documents for
the Alternative Financing and any Replacement Financing, and all references to
the Financing Sources shall include the Persons providing or arranging the
Alternative Financing or any Replacement Financing. In the event that each of
Parent and Merger Sub has obtained substitute financing, the proceeds of which
are received on the Closing Date and which amount substitutes an equivalent
portion of the Debt Financing, for the purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.17_, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to
include such substitute financing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition
to Closing.

(b) Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.17_ shall require any cooperation or

accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ _that_ the Company
agrees that Parent and Merger Sub may share non-public or otherwise
confidential information with the rating agencies and Financing Sources as

are rating agencies and Financing Sources in connection with the Debt
Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and agree to
customary confidentiality arrangements, including customary "click through"

(c) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its

66

    

 Representatives for all reasonable, documented and invoiced costs incurred

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a breach by the Company
or its Subsidiaries of their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_

Agreement or a breach for purposes of _Article IX_ or a breach of the
condition precedent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, unless such breach
is a willful and material breach and directly results in the Debt Financing
not being available to Parent, and a breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries
of their obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.17(a)(v)_ shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or a breach for purposes of _Article IX_ or a breach
of the condition precedent set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, unless such
breach directly results in the Debt Financing not being available to Parent.

7.18.  _Restructuring_. To facilitate the Merger and provide for the optimal

Restructuring Steps are appropriate for such purpose; _provided_ , that
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries (i) shall be required to take
any action (x) if taking such action would impair, prevent or
delay consummation of the Transactions or (y) in contravention of (A) any
Organizational Document of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, (B) any
Contract, oral or written, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets are bound, or
(C) applicable Law, (ii) shall be required to take or effect any restructuring
steps or incur any liabilities in respect thereto prior to the date the

Company that any material adverse effect or similar condition has been
irrevocably waived by the Debt Financing Sources and any other parties with
respect to the Debt Financing and (II) an irrevocable written notice from
Parent and Merger Sub that each of Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably deem all
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  to be satisfied and that Parent
and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources are prepared to proceed immediately
with the Closing (and any other evidence reasonably requested by the Company
that the Closing will occur), and (iii) shall be required to take any action
that could adversely affect the classification of the Company as a REIT or
could subject the Company to any "prohibited transactions" taxes or other
material Taxes under Code Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, so long as the Company is not in breach of this _Section_ __
_ 7.18_ as modified by clause (B) of the immediately following sentence, the
Restructuring Steps (or the inability to complete the Restructuring Steps)
and any other action taken by the Company in connection therewith will not
affect or modify in any respect the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

 



67

    

 (A) none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or
violated by, any of the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
7.18_ or required by Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.18_ and (B) any
breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of their obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.18_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or a
breach for purposes of _Article IX_ or a breach of the condition precedent set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, unless such breach is a willful and
material breach and directly results in the Debt Financing not being available
to Parent. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.18_,

shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries not previously reimbursed).
Parent shall provide an initial draft of the Restructuring Steps to the

7.19. _Third Party Consents_. The Company shall, and shall cause each
Subsidiary to, reasonably cooperate with Parent at Parents request, and use
reasonable best efforts, to (a) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers
(including waivers of any fees, rights of first offer or refusal, buy/sell
rights, and profit sharing) from any third party in connection with the
Transactions reasonably requested by Parent, including those set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 1.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule and those which are parties to
agreements and documentation described in _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Third Party Consents_ "), and (b)
assist Parent with the preparation and negotiation of, participation with, and
delivery to, any third party of any required notices or similar documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.19_ to compensate any third party, make any accommodation
commitment or incur any liability or obligation to any third party to obtain
any such consent or approval, unless Parent or its Affiliates agree
to compensate any such third party on the Companys behalf or to promptly
reimburse the Company for any payments made or liabilities to any such third
party, in each case in connection with obtaining such consents or approvals,
and the Company shall not compensate or agree to compensate any such third
party, make any accommodation commitment or incur any liability or obligation
to any such third party in connection with obtaining such consents or
approvals without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, (i) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that it is not a condition to the Closing to obtain any Third Party
Consents and (ii) __ a breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of their
obligations under this _Section 7.19_ shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement or a breach for purposes of _Article IX_ or a breach of the
condition precedent set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, unless such breach is a
willful and material breach. Without limiting the obligations of the Company
under the foregoing, in connection with obtaining any consent, approval or
waiver or providing any notice or similar documents under this  _Section_ __
_ 7.19_, Parent shall have (i) primary responsibility for contacting and
obtaining such consents, approvals or waiver from the counterparties to whom
such consent, approval or waiver is being sought or providing such notices or
similar documents, as applicable, and (ii) the right to direct the overall

 



68

    

 strategy in obtaining any such consent, approval or waiver or providing any
such notice or similar document; _provided_ that Parent will consult in
advance with the Company regarding any such discussions and negotiations and
give the Company notice and an opportunity to participate in any communication
with such third parties, and the Company, at Parents request, shall initiate
and facilitate such activities.

_Requisite Stockholder Vote Not Obtained_ ), or Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.4(a)_ ( _Company Breach_ ) or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_ and, in either
case, prior to the date of termination the Company has received a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal or a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
disclosed and not withdrawn and (B) within twelve (12) months of the date of
any termination referred to in clause (A) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ _that_ for purposes of this _ Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)(i)_, the
references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" will be deemed
to be references to "50%";

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)_ ( _Change of Recommendation_ ); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ );

then, in each case, the Company will pay Parent as consideration for the
disposition of rights acquired under this Agreement an aggregate amount equal
to $261,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Payment_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent (1)
in the case of a payment required by _ Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)(i)_, within two
Business Days after consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) in the case
of a payment required by _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)(ii)_, within two Business
Days after termination of this Agreement, or (3) in the case of a payment
required by _ Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)(iii)_, concurrently with or prior to
termination of this Agreement, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Payment on more than one occasion.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ ( _Requisite Stockholder Vote Not
Obtained_ ) (other than a deemed termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)_) or by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_, then the Company
will reimburse Parent for Parents reasonable and documented out of pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
and performance of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions up to
an amount equal to $70,000,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement Payment_ ")
within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, and in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Expense Reimbursement Payment if it has paid the Company Termination
Payment in full. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section_ __ _
9.5(a)_, the Expense Reimbursement Payment shall not be the sole remedy of
Parent against the Company. The Expense Reimbursement Payment paid by the
Company to Parent in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ shall be
credited against any Company Termination Payment obligation that becomes due
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_.

 



74

    

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ ( _ _Outside Date__ ) and, at the time of such
termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ or (ii) by
the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_,
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company or, if directed by
the Company, to Forest City TRS, LLC an aggregate amount equal to
$488,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Payment_ " and, together with the
Company Termination Payment and the Expense Reimbursement Payment, the "
_Termination Payments_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, within two Business Days after termination of
this Agreement to an account designated in writing by the Company. The
parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will Parent be required to pay
the Parent Termination Payment on more than one occasion.

 

(e) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 9.5_ are an integral part of the Merger and the other Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, no party would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, in the event any Termination Payment is required to be
paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ and the Company or Parent, as applicable fails to
timely pay to other party such Termination Payment and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as applicable for such
Termination Payment, the Company or Parent, as applicable, will pay the other
party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements of
counsel or other professionals and experts and court costs) in connection with
such suit, together with interest thereon at the prime rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ (or if not reported therein, as reported in another
authoritative source reasonably selected by the other party) in effect on the
date such Termination Payment was required to be paid from such date through
the date of full payment thereof.

 

(f) If the Company Termination Payment is required to be paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, Parents right to receive the Company Termination
Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(e)_ will be
the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, its respective Subsidiaries, any of
Parents or its Subsidiaries respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
Affiliates, agents and other Representatives and any other Person against the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives and the Financing Sources for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated.

 

(g) If a Parent Termination Payment is required to be paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_, the Companys right to receive the Parent
Termination Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.5(e)_, and the expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of
Parent in _Section_ __ _ 7.17_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.18_, and _Section_ __ _
7.19 _will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company, its respective
Subsidiaries, any of the Companys

 



75

    

 or its Subsidiaries respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents and other Representatives and any other Person against Parent,
Parents Subsidiaries, any of Parents or its Subsidiaries respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives and
the Financing Sources for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger and the
other Transactions to be consummated.

 

(h) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that: (i) a Termination
Payment is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company in the
circumstances in which such Termination Payment is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (ii) any Company
Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, and any additional amounts
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(e)_, when paid in full accordance with this
Agreement will be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary
damages of Parent or the Company, as applicable, and each of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives arising out of or related to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Transactions (including any breach of this Agreement
by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the Merger or the other Transactions, and any claims or actions under
applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, (iii)
in the event this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the
Company Termination Payment or the Parent Termination Payment is payable, in
no event will Parent or the Company, as the case may be, be entitled to seek
or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Company Termination
Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, as applicable, and any additional
amounts pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(e)_ against the Company or Parent,
as applicable, and each of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives or any of their respective assets, and in no event will Parent
or the Company, as applicable, be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages
of any kind (including against the Financing Sources), including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with respect to,
this Agreement or the Merger or the other Transactions (including any breach
by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the Merger, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the other
Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable Laws arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure, and (iv) the parties will take such
actions as are necessary and sufficient so that the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ may be enforceable against such party, including
executing and delivering any waivers, releases and similar instruments
consistent therewith upon any other partys request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ will not limit the right of the parties hereto
to specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
10.5(f)_ (subject to the limitations set forth therein) or with respect to any
provision of this Agreement that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement.

9.6. _Payment of Parent Termination Payment_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
the Company determines in good faith that there exists a material risk that
any amounts due to the Company under _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ would be treated
as Nonqualifying Income upon the payment of such amounts to the Company, the
amount paid to the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ in any tax
year shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company in
such year without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
for any tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount were
Nonqualifying Income as determined by the Company in good faith.

(b) If the amount payable for any tax year pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.6(a)_ is less than the amount that Parent would otherwise be obligated to
pay to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ (the " _Section_ __ _
9.5(d) Amount_"), then:

(i) Parent shall place the Section 9.5(d) Amount into an escrow account (the
" _Escrow Account_ ") using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company and shall not release any portion thereof to the
Company, and the Company shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and
until the Company delivers to Parent, at the sole option of the Company, (i) a
letter (a " _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d) Amount Company Letter_") from the Company
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any
relevant taxable year, as determined by the Company in good faith, (ii) an
opinion (a " _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d) Amount Tax Opinion_") of the Companys
tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would
not constitute Nonqualifying Income or (iii) a private letter ruling issued
by the IRS to the Company indicating that the receipt of any Section 9.5(d)
Amount hereunder will not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the REIT
Requirements (a " _REIT Qualification Ruling_ " and, collectively with a
Section 9.5(d) Amount Company Letter and a Section 9.5(d) Amount Tax Opinion,
a " _Release Document_ "). The escrow agreement shall also provide that (x)
the amount in the Escrow Account shall be treated as the property of Parent,
unless it is released from such Escrow Account to the Company, (y) all income
earned upon the amount in the Escrow Account shall be treated as income of
Parent and reported, as and to the extent required by applicable Law, by the
escrow agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, as income earned by
Parent whether or not said income has been distributed during such tax year,
and (z) the amount in the Escrow Account shall be invested in Permitted
Investments only as determined by Parent in its sole discretion;

(ii) Pending the delivery of a Release Document by the Company to Parent, the
Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to borrow the Section
9.5(d) Amount from the Escrow Account pursuant to a loan agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company that (i) requires Parent to lend the Company
immediately available cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Section 9.5(d)
Amount, and (ii) provides for (A) a reasonable interest rate and reasonable
covenants, taking into account the credit standing and profile of the Company
or any guarantor of the Company at the time of such loan, and (B) a seven (7)
year maturity with no periodic amortization;

 



77

    

(iii) Any amount held in escrow pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ for
seven (7) years shall be released from such escrow to be used as determined by
Parent in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Company shall have no
rights in such amounts thereafter; and

 

(iv) The Company shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the Escrow
Account.

 

(c) Parent shall cooperate in good faith with the Company (including amending
this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ at the reasonable request of the Company) in order
to (x) maximize the portion of the payments that may be made to the Company
hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements,
(y) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable REIT Qualification
Ruling, or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable Section 9.5(d)
Amount Tax Opinion. Such cooperation shall include, for example, agreeing to
make payments hereunder to a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company or an
affiliate or designee of the Company.

9.7. _Payment of Company Termination Payment_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
the Parent determines in good faith that there exists a material risk that
any amounts due to Parent under _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ would be treated as
Nonqualifying Income in the hands of any direct or indirect owner of Parent
that intends to qualify as a REIT (a " _Parent REIT Affiliate_ ") upon the
payment of such amounts to Parent, the amount paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount
that can be paid to Parent in such year without causing any Parent REIT
Affiliate to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount were Nonqualifying Income as determined by
the Parent in good faith.

 

(b) If the amount payable for any tax year pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.7(a)_
is less than the amount that Company would otherwise be obligated to pay to
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ (the " _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)
Amount_"), then:

 

(i) the Company shall place the Section 9.5(b) Amount into an Escrow Account
using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall
not release any portion thereof to Parent, and Parent shall not be entitled to
any such amount, unless and until Parent delivers to the Company, at the sole
option of the Company, a letter (a " _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b) Amount Parent
Letter_") from Parent indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Parent without causing any Parent REIT Affiliate to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, as determined by Parent in
good faith. The escrow agreement shall also provide that (x) the amount in the
Escrow Account shall be treated as the property of the Company, unless it is
released from such Escrow Account to Parent, (y) all income earned upon the
amount in the Escrow Account shall be treated as income of the Company and
reported, as and to the extent required by applicable Law, by the escrow agent
to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, as income earned by the Company
whether or not said income has been distributed during such tax year, and (z)
the amount in the Escrow Account shall be invested in Permitted Investments
only as determined by the Company in its sole discretion;

 



78

    

(ii) Pending the delivery of the Section 9.5(b) Amount Parent Letter by
Parent to the Company, Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
borrow the Section 9.5(b) Amount from the Escrow Account pursuant to a loan
agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent that (i) requires the Company to
lend Parent immediately available cash proceeds in an amount equal to the
Section 9.5(b) Amount, and (ii) provides for (A) a reasonable interest rate
and reasonable covenants, taking into account the credit standing and profile
of Parent or any guarantor of Parent at the time of such loan, and (B) a
seven (7) year maturity with no periodic amortization;

 

(iii) Any amount held in escrow pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ for
seven (7) years shall be released from such escrow to be used as determined
by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, and Parent shall have no
rights in such amounts thereafter; and

 

(iv) Parent shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the Escrow
Account.

 

(c) The Company shall cooperate in good faith with Parent (including amending
this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ at the reasonable request of Parent) in order to
maximize the portion of the payments that may be made to Parent hereunder
without causing any Parent REIT Affiliate to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements. Such cooperation shall include, for example, agreeing to
make payments hereunder to an affiliate or designee of Parent.

shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or

payment of the Parent Termination Payment, Company Termination Payment or the
Expense Reimbursement Payment, other monetary damages or in the event that
the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(f)_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
10.5(f)_ shall require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a

 partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(f)_ before exercising any termination right under
_Article IX_ (and pursuing the payment of the Parent Termination Payment,
Company Termination Payment, Expense Reimbursement Payment or other monetary
damages after such termination, as applicable) nor shall the commencement of
any action pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.5(f)_ or anything contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(f)_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
10.5(f)_ and payment of the Company Termination Payment, Expense
Reimbursement Payment or other monetary damages, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive

while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in

Termination Payment or other monetary damages, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the Merger and the

assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide for an adequate remedy. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties further acknowledge and agree that prior to the
Closing, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause

the time when the Closing would be required to occur pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 1.2_, (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (C) the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing provided for pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ has

and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent
that it is prepared to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub together for any losses,
damages, costs or expenses of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
related to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, shall be
limited to an amount equal to: (i) the amount of the Parent Termination
Payment, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any expense reimbursement and
indemnification obligations pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.17_, _Section_ __
_ 7.18_, _Section_ __ _ 7.19_, and _Section_ __ _ 9.5(e)_ (collectively,
the " _Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability

Capital Stock in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder.

of Capital Stock would result in the Corporation being "closely held" within
the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the
ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or
otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to,
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership that would result in the
Corporation owning (actually or Constructively) an interest in a tenant that
is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the
Corporation from such tenant would cause the Corporation to fail to satisfy
any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code).

 

(iii) Any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock that, if effective, would result
in the Capital Stock being beneficially owned by less than 100 Persons
(determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be
void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such
shares of Capital Stock.

 

(b) _Transfer in Trust_. If any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock occurs

Beneficiary, as described in Section 7.3, effective as of the close of
business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such
Person shall acquire no rights in such shares; or

 

(ii) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (i) of this sentence

Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 7.2.1(a)(i) or
(ii) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no
rights in such shares of Capital Stock.

(c) To the extent that, upon a transfer of shares of Capital Stock pursuant

Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership and Transfer for the purpose,
among others, of the Corporations maintenance of its status as a Real Estate
Investment Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). Subject to certain further restrictions and except as expressly
provided in the Corporations Charter, (i) no Person may Beneficially Own or
Constructively Own shares of the Corporations Common Stock in excess of the
Common Stock Ownership Limit, unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (in
which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable); (ii) no Person may
Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock of the
Corporation in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, unless such

Capital Stock that would result in the Corporation being "closely held" under

such Transfer would result in the Capital Stock of the Corporation being

Trustee of a Trust for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. In

specified by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion if the
Board of Directors determines that ownership or a Transfer or other event may
violate the restrictions described above. Furthermore, if the ownership
restriction provided in (iv) above would be violated, or upon the occurrence
of certain events, attempted Transfers in violation of the restrictions
described above may be void ab initio. All capitalized terms in this legend
have the meanings given to them in the Charter of the Corporation, as the same
may be amended from time to time, a copy of which, including the restrictions
on transfer and ownership, will be furnished to each holder of shares of
Capital Stock of the Corporation on request and without charge. Requests for
such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its
principal office.
