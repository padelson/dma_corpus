Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants and subject to the
conditions herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

_THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement; Acceptance of and Payment for Shares_. As promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no
shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(other than any such shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the Offer Conditions and
the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer promptly (and, in any event, within three (3)
Business Days) after the Expiration Date. Parent shall provide, or cause to
be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase
any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing
Date_."

 

(b) _Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions_. The Offer Conditions are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve
the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the
terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the
Offer Price, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv)
amend, modify or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition, (v)
impose additional conditions to the Offer, (vi) except as expressly provided
in _Section 1.1(c)_, terminate, accelerate, extend or otherwise amend or
modify the Expiration Date, (vii) provide any "subsequent offering period"

 



2  within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (viii)
amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any
material respect to any holder of Company Common Stock or (ix) otherwise
amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse
in any material respect to any holder of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (including
the Initial Expiration Date), (i) any Offer Condition shall not have been
satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub may and, if requested by the Company,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on
one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business
Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), in each case, in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
, that the maximum number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to
this clause (i) in circumstances where all of the conditions to the Offer are
satisfied other than the Minimum Tender Condition shall be twenty (20)
Business Days; (ii) the Marketing Period has not ended, then the Offer will be
automatically extended until the earliest to occur of (A) any Business Day
before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no
less than two (2) Business Days prior notice to the Company and (B) the first
(1st) Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period; or (iii) the
Offer is required to be extended by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer, then the Offer will be automatically
extended for the minimum period required by such rule, regulation,
interpretation or position; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) beyond the Termination Date (the date on which the Offer
finally expires (taking into account any extensions that may be elected or
required pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 1.1(c)_) is
referred to herein as, the " _Expiration Date_ "). The Offer may not be
terminated prior to any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_. If (i) at
any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (including the Initial Expiration
Date), (A) any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived and (B)
no further extensions or re-extensions of the Offer have been duly elected or
required pursuant to this  _Section 1.1(c)_, or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or (iii) there shall exist a Top-Up
Impediment and Merger Sub elects to terminate the Offer, then, in each case,
Merger Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours
following such expiration or termination, but prior to the Offer Closing),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The termination of the
Offer pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination_ ," and the date on
which the Offer Termination occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Termination Date_." If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger
Sub, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting
on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock
to the registered holders thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Offer Termination, in and of itself, shall not give rise to a right
of termination of this Agreement unless and to the extent expressly provided
in _Section 7.1_ and, notwithstanding the fact that the Offer Termination
may have occurred, the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement other than with respect to the Offer shall continue in full force
and effect, including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

 



3 (d) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and
other ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company that may be required by the Exchange Act
and other applicable securities Laws and/or as reasonably requested by Parent
and/or Merger Sub to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
correct or supplement any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
any applicable Law, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_ ").
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between Parent, Merger Sub and their respective directors, officers,
employees, consultants, advisors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers
and other advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ "),
on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand.
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing
of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and shall in good
faith consider all comments reasonably proposed by the Company.

(e) _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable hereunder any amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the applicable Tax
authority and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
holder from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so deducted and
withheld.

 



4 Section 1.2. _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC (and promptly thereafter
mail) a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements
and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which shall, subject to
_Section 5.6_, describe and make the recommendation of the board of directors
of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") that the stockholders of the Company
accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and, if required by applicable Law, adopt this Agreement (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), and shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. The
Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 the Fairness Opinion. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer
Documents. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, Parent shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish
to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be
required by the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and/or as reasonably
requested by the Company to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
correct or supplement any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common
Stock, in each case, as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and resolve any comments of
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) as promptly as reasonably practicable. Prior
to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding
to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto,
the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response and shall in good faith consider
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

(b) _Stockholder Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all of its stockholders of record and
security position listings of the Shares held in stock depositories, each as
of a recent date, and such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels, security position listings and computer files
and all other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Shares) and other assistance as Merger Sub may
reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial holders of the Shares. Subject to the

 



5  requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) keep confidential and not disclose the information contained in
any such labels, lists, listings and files, in each case, to the extent
required by the confidentiality agreement dated as of April 11, 2012 between
One Equity Partners IV, L.P. and the Company (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), (ii) use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and (iii) if this Agreement shall be
terminated, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 1.3. _Top-Up Option_.

(a) _Top-Up Option Grant_. The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms
and conditions set forth in this _Section 1.3_, to purchase at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price that number of newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned
by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
including the Support Agreement Shares, shall constitute one share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Top-Up Option may not be exercised (i) prior to Merger
Sub accepting for payment the shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer, (ii) to purchase a number of Top-Up Option
Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized
and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as
unissued) and not reserved for issuance or otherwise committed to be issued
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option or (iii) if there shall be in
effect at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option any Law that has the
effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable
once in whole but not in part and only upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 1.3(b)_. The parties hereto shall cooperate to ensure that
the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares complies with all
applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (as
amended, including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Securities Act_ "). If the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived and
there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that
number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub, would represent at least
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
Offer Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-
Up Option on the Offer Closing Date and on such date shall give the Company
written notice (the " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and
its subsidiaries at the time of such notice (after giving effect to the Offer
Closing). Such notice will also include an undertaking signed by Merger Sub
and Parent that, immediately following the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "), Merger Sub will, and Parent will
cause Merger Sub to, consummate the

 



6  Merger in accordance with _Section 1.4_, _Section 1.5_, _Section 1.6_ and
the last sentence of _Section 5.3_. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice on the Offer
Closing Date, deliver on the Offer Closing Date (and in any event no later
than the Offer Closing) written notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") to Merger Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice,
the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be issued to Merger Sub. If the number
of Top-Up Option Shares specified in the Top-Up Notice is different than the
number of Top-Up Option Shares specified in the Top-Up Exercise Notice, the
Company and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event on
the Offer Closing Date, reasonably agree on the appropriate number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, which shall take place simultaneously
with the Offer Closing at the location specified in _Section 1.5_, the
purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the
Company, at Merger Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, or (ii) by (y) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an
amount equal to or greater than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option
Shares and (z) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to
the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding
clause (y) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (i) shall be due
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (ii) shall bear simple
interest of five percent (5%) per annum, (iii) shall be full recourse to
Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time
without premium or penalty and (v) shall have no other material terms. At the
Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities
Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to
the Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under
the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-
Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being
and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, any dilutive impact on the value of the shares
of Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value
of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated
by _Section 2.6_, except as required by applicable Law.

(e)  _Assignment of Top-Up Option_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company,
the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or
otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 1.3(e)_
shall be null and void. 

 



7 Section 1.4. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue under the
name "MModal Inc." as the Surviving Corporation and shall continue to be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

Section 1.5. _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Merger Closing_ ") will take place (a) on the date of and immediately
following the Offer Closing (and Top-Up Closing if the Top-Up Option has been
exercised) or (b) if the Offer Termination shall have occurred on or prior to
such time, at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by
the parties hereto, but no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), in
either case, at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 1999 Avenue of
the Stars, 29th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90067, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date being
the " _Merger Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , that, in the case of clause (b)
only, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to consummate
the Merger Closing if the Marketing Period has not ended prior to the time
that the Merger Closing would otherwise have occurred pursuant to the
foregoing, in which case the Merger Closing shall not occur until the earlier
to occur of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on
three (3) Business Days written notice to the Company and (ii) the first (1st)
Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period
subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ to the Merger Closing as of the date determined
pursuant to this proviso (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions).

Section 1.6. _Effective Time_. Simultaneously with the Merger Closing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger, or a
certificate of ownership and merger, as applicable (in either case, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), with respect to the Merger to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary
of State_ "), in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on the date
and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State or at such subsequent date and/or time as is agreed between
the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.7. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

_Section 5.7_.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the

terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by Law, in each case, consistent with the obligations set forth in

of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "MModal Inc."

Section 1.9. _Board of Directors_. Each of the parties hereto shall take all
necessary action to ensure that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior

Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.10. _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed

ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub
(including as a result of an exercise of the Top-Up Option by Merger Sub), in
each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares described in
_Section 2.1(a)_ and, except as provided in

 



9   _Section 2.6_, the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock,
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock
other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement
and subject to _Section 5.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section 5.1(a)(x)_, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the number of Shares shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such change.

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
"), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1(b)_. As of or prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ (such cash
amount excluding any interest or other earnings thereon, collectively, the "
_Payment Fund_ "). In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds
to ensure that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to make such payments.
Parent shall cause the Payment Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) and (ii)
applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)_ and
_Section 2.3(b)_. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3(b)_, except
as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Letters of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and, in any event, not later than the second (2nd) Business
Day thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the

 



10  Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, substantially similar to the forms
filed with the SEC pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_.

 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates; Payment_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be
mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer,
as elected by the surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents

the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the Company Common
Shares formerly represented by the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any applicable stock
transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such shares or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid
or are not payable.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent as
general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash, without
interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, 

 



11  escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any transnational, United States (federal, state or
local) or foreign government, or any governmental, regulatory, police,
executive, taxing, judicial or administrative authority, department, court,
tribunal, board, bureau, official, arbitral body, agency, commission or any
non-governmental self-regulatory authority (including any stock exchange)
(each, a " _Governmental Authority_ "), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective

additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) in the amount of such
losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty days (30) or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments
will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 

Section 2.3. _Company Equity Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
Acceleration Time (as defined below), the Company Board (or a duly constituted
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take all such other
actions that do not involve payments by the Company (other than any
payments contemplated or required hereunder) as may be required to provide
for the following:

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Each option granted pursuant to a Company Plan or
otherwise (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the earlier to occur of the time of the Offer Closing and
the Effective Time (such earlier time, the " _Acceleration Time_ ") (whether
vested or unvested) shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Acceleration
Time without any action on the part of any holder of such Company Option, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (on the terms set forth in
the following sentence) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option, less any required withholding Taxes and without
interest (each payment under this _Section 2.3(a)_, an " _Option Cash
Payment_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company
Options the Option Cash Payments as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time. As of the Acceleration Time, the Company Options shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment, if any,
as soon as reasonably practicably after the Effective Time.

 



12 (b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. As of immediately prior to the Offer
Closing, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a
Company Plan or otherwise and subject to restrictions on transfer and/or
forfeiture, including any performance-based conditions (" _Company Restricted
Stock_ "), shall become or otherwise be deemed vested and all restrictions
thereon shall lapse, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the equity
plan and/or award agreement governing such Company Restricted Stock as in
effect on the date hereof, and each holder thereof shall have the right to
tender (or to direct the Company to tender on his or her behalf) the shares of
Company Common Stock underlying the award of Company Restricted Stock then
held (net of any shares of Company Common Stock withheld to satisfy required
withholding Taxes) into the Offer. To the extent any shares of Company
Restricted Stock are not so tendered or the Offer Termination shall have
occurred, upon the Effective Time, each such share of Company Restricted Stock
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_.

 

(c) _Treatment of Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units_. As of immediately
prior to the Acceleration Time, each Company restricted stock unit (other
than any Company Performance Stock Unit) that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Acceleration Time (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ "),
whether or not then vested, shall fully vest immediately prior to, and then
shall be cancelled at, the Acceleration Time (each, a " _Cancelled RSU_ "),
and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former
holder of any such Cancelled RSU, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest and less any required
withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (i) the Offer Price and (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cancelled RSU.

 

(d) _Treatment of Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units_. As of
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time, each Company restricted stock
unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceleration Time which

Performance Stock Unit_ " and, collectively with the Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ "), whether or not then vested, shall fully vest (as if all
performance conditions have been achieved at the target level)
immediately prior to, and then shall be cancelled at, the Acceleration Time
(each, a " _Cancelled PSU_ "), and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such Cancelled PSU, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash,
without interest and less any required withholding Taxes, equal to the product
of (i) the Offer Price and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cancelled PSU.

Section 2.4. _ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions to terminate the Companys 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan effective
as of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time.

 



13 Section 2.5. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate

 

Section 2.6. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
demanded appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments
required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and the aggregate Merger Consideration
(and Payment Fund) shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as if the
holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Merger
Closing Date. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any of the shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company with respect thereto, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.7. _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid upon the surrender
of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the applicable
merger consideration, as provided for in _Section 2.1(b)_, for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

and/or debt prices) in any country or region in which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries conducts business; (ii) changes or developments in any of the

materially and disproportionately affected thereby as compared with other

rights to or claims for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, other than
any such investigations, proceedings, or claims that would not have,

(b) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning

(the " _IRS_ ") as to its qualification under the Code and to the effect that
each such trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
nothing has occurred since the date of such determination or opinion letter
that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect on such qualification or tax-exempt status.
The Company has made available or delivered to the Buyer a current, accurate
and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists, an accurate
description) of all Company Benefit Plans (other than Foreign Plans) and, to
the extent applicable, (i) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument, (ii) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter, (iii)

subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any agreement, plan, program or
arrangement which would require the Company or any subsidiary to pay,
reimburse or indemnify any employee, director or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any excise tax
imposed under Section 4999 of the Code incurred with respect to, or resulting
from, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Code so that no amounts paid pursuant to any such Company Benefit Plan is
subject to tax under Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect: (i) all contributions to, and payments from, (other than
payments to be made from a trust, insurance contract or other funding medium)
Company Benefit Plans maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States
(but excluding any plan, program or arrangement that is mandated by
applicable Law or maintained by a governmental entity) (such plans, the "
_Foreign Plans_ ") which may have been required to be made in accordance with
the terms of any such Foreign Plan, and, when applicable, the law of
the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely
made; (ii) all such contributions to the Foreign Plans, and all payments under
the Foreign Plans, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not

ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the separate disclosure
letter (it being understood that disclosure of any item in any section of such
disclosure letter shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on its face) delivered by Parent to the Company on the date hereof
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failures to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Material
Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any change, event, effect or circumstance that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on a timely basis.

Section 4.2. _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company copies of the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing
documents), and other organizational or

 



31  governing documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to date, of
each of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the " _Parent Organizational
Documents_ "). The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and
effect. None of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the
other parties thereto are in violation of any provision of the Parent
Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3. _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated by
this Agreement and to be executed by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(collectively, the " _Parent Documents_ "), to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer, the Merger and the Financing. The execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub of this Agreement and each Parent Document and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the Financing, have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Parent and Merger
Sub (subject to compliance by Parent with the fourth WHEREAS paragraph in the
recitals to this Agreement), and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Parent Documents or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the
Financing (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement and each of
the Parent Documents have been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto, this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to general equitable
principles).

Section 4.4. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Parent
Documents by Parent and/or Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer,
the Merger and the Financing, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any
of the provisions hereof or thereof will (i) conflict with or violate the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming the consents,
approvals and authorizations specified in _Section 4.4(b)_ have
been received and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and
any condition precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver
has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound
or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than, in the case
of the Financing, any Lien required or permitted thereunder) on any property
or asset of Parent or 

 



32  Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit
agreement, or any other contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or
by which Parent or Merger Sub or any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub
is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
violations, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations, amendments,
accelerations, or cancellations which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the Parent Documents, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the
Merger and the Financing, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of
the provisions of this Agreement or the Parent Documents will require any
consent, approval, authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws, any
applicable Antitrust Laws, filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL and the rules of NASDAQ, and (ii) where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 4.5. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub,
Guarantor or any of their respective properties or assets, at law or in
equity, and there are no Orders by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority, in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.6. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Except for the Support
Agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor or any of their respective
subsidiaries has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Offer Price or the Merger Consideration; (b) any stockholder of the Company
(i) agrees to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer or to
vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote against, or
not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any Superior Proposal; or
(c) as of the date hereof, any Third Party has agreed to provide, directly or
indirectly, equity capital (other than pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter) to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in part
the Offer or the Merger.

Section 4.7. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or
the Information Statement will, at the time such document is filed with the
SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time such
document is first published, or sent or given to the Companys stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading or (b) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders

 



33  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

Section 4.8. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company copies of (i) the executed commitment
letter from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital Markets, including any
related fee letter in redacted form, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and
(ii) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from Guarantor pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the investor parties thereto have
committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "
and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is
a third party beneficiary thereto with respect to the provisions specified
therein.

 

(b) All of the Financing Commitments are, as of the date hereof, in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to
the knowledge of Parent) the other parties thereto. Except for a fee letter
and engagement letter (complete copies of which have been provided to the
Company with only the fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which would
adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or
availability of the Debt Financing) redacted), as of the date hereof there are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, (i) no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term of the Financing Commitments, and (ii) there has been no failure of any
condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, of the Financing Commitments or
other action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub that would or would
reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has reason to believe that Parent would be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be
satisfied by it. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid
on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger
(as applicable), the aggregate proceeds of the Financing, if funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitments, and, subject to _Section 4.14_,
together with the cash and cash equivalents available to the Company, will be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer
and the Merger), and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents
and Merger Subs

 



34  obligations under this Agreement in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger Consideration, all
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and all associated costs and
expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing
of indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith). There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing (including any
flex provisions), other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the
Financing Commitments.

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party to any agreement or
understanding which directly or indirectly limits or restricts the ability of
any person to provide debt financing for other potential purchasers of the
Company.

 

Section 4.9. _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company the Guarantee. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of
Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights, and to general equitable principles) and, as of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Guarantor
under the Guarantee.

Section 4.10.  _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub
is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each of Parent and Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
and has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior
to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to each of Parent and Merger Subs formation
and pursuant to this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.11. _Interest in Competitors_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or
Guarantor own, and none of any of their respective affiliates (insofar as such
affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent, Merger Sub or
Guarantor under the HSR Act) own in excess of 5% of the outstanding equity
interests in any entity or person engaged in any business involving the
provision of clinical documentation solutions, speech recognition solutions
and/or dictation and transcription services for the healthcare industry.

Section 4.12. _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have
not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

 



35 Section 4.13. _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other similar fee or commission in connection with
the Offer, the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub
or Guarantor. 

Section 4.14. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is Solvent as of the date of this
Agreement and, assuming (i) that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to
the Effective Time (and for the avoidance of doubt, before giving effect to
the incurrence of the Debt Financing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such Debt Financing), (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer
and/or the Merger (as applicable) and (iii) the accuracy as of the Effective
Time of the representations and warranties of the Company in  _Article III_
in all material respects (but without giving effect to any knowledge,
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception
contained therein), each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will,
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing and the payment of the Offer Price in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted
for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger Consideration, all amounts to
be paid pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and all associated costs and expenses of
the Offer and the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of
indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith) and all other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be Solvent at and immediately
after the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 4.14_, the term "
_Solvent_ " means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a)
the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub (and,
after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) will
exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger,
the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries) has
not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does not believe that it will
incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature in the
ordinary course of business and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis with
its subsidiaries) has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct
its business. For purposes of this _Section 4.14_, " _debt_ " means any
liability on a claim, and " _claim_ " means any (y) right to payment, whether
or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (z) any right to an equitable remedy for breach
of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such
right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 

Section 4.15. _DGCL Section 203_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub (assuming the
accuracy of the representation contained in  _Section 3.22_ as such
representation relates to Parents and Merger Subs entry into the Support
Agreements) is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has either
Parent or Merger Sub been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



36 Section 4.16. _No Ownership of Company Securities_. None of Parent, Merger
Sub, Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries beneficially own (as
such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares
of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities
of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or
otherwise) in, the Company, as of the date hereof or at any time prior to the
Offer Closing.

 

Section 4.17. _WARN Act_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub are neither planning nor contemplating, and Parent and Merger Sub have
neither made nor taken, any decisions or actions concerning the Company
Employees after the Merger Closing that would require the service of notice
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar local
laws.

Section 4.18. _Agreements with Management_. Other than this Agreement, as of
the date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments,
agreements, arrangements, obligations or understandings between any of
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, on the
one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Company Board or
any of the Companys affiliates, on the other hand, relating in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 4.19. _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that, as of the date hereof
and to the knowledge of Parent, they and their Representatives, to their
satisfaction, (a) have received full access to (i) such books and records,
facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company which they
and their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to review and
(ii) the Electronic Data Room and (b) have had full opportunity to meet with
the management of the Company and to discuss the business and assets of the
Company. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ and
in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ or _Annex I_ , (x)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes, or has made, any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any
representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ or
_Annex I_ , (y) no person has been authorized by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its
business or otherwise in connection with the Offer and Merger, and if made,
such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger
Sub as having been authorized by such entity and (z) any estimate, projection,
prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or any other
materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Representatives, including any materials or information made
available in the Electronic Data Room or in connection with presentations by
the Companys management, are not and shall not be deemed to be or include
representations or warranties unless and to the extent any such materials or
information is the subject of any express representation or warranty set forth
in _Article III_ or in any certificate delivered pursuant to  _Section
6.2(c)_ or _Annex I_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges

 



37  that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent
investigation of the condition, operations and business of the Company and its
subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger
and the Financing, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied on the results of
its own independent investigation.

 

Section 4.20. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this  _Article IV_ and in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_, the Company acknowledges
that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information
provided to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the accuracy, completeness or currency thereof. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any other person
resulting from the distribution or failure to distribute to the Company, or
the Companys use of, any such information, unless and to the extent any such
information is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in
this _Article IV_ or in any certificate delivered pursuant to  _Section
6.3(c)_.

Section 5.2. _Proxy Statement_.

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Proxy Statement_. The Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days)
following the Expiration Date (or such earlier date as either the Company or
Parent, by written notice to the Company, may determine), prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company be required to prepare or file the Proxy Statement prior to
the Initial Expiration Date or at any time that the Minimum Tender Condition
has been satisfied. Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 5.6_, the
Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation with respect to the
Merger, the Fairness Opinion and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any

 



42  comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ and, in each case, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments
or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, to not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty
is made by the Company with respect to written information supplied by Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

 

(b) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Amendments_. If the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company
Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will
not file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval or solicit any proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement until after the Offer Termination. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or Parent or any of the Companys or Parents subsidiaries, or
their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company
or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall
promptly inform the other party. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

(c) _Cooperation_. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC). Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response and shall in good faith consider such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

Section 5.3.  _Stockholders  Meeting_. If the adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, subject to _Section
5.2(b)_, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days)

 



43  after the later of (i) the Offer Termination Date and (ii) the date on which
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement, take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law, the rules of NASDAQ and the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
to establish a record date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as may be required by
applicable Law or an Order of any Governmental Authority, in no event shall
such meeting be set for a date later than 30 calendar days following the date
the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any adjournments or
postponements of such meeting shall require the prior written consent
of Parent, except that (i) the Company may adjourn the Stockholder Meeting in
the case and then only to the extent that such adjournment is required to
allow additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) has instructed the
Company is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior
to the Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may (or upon the written request of Parent, shall) adjourn or postpone
the Stockholders Meeting if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are either (A) insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at
the Stockholders Meeting or (B) insufficient affirmative votes to adopt this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the record date shall not be changed without
Parent consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Unless the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change
as permitted in accordance with _Section 5.6_, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and
all rules of NASDAQ. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with  _Section 7.1_, an Adverse
Recommendation Change (or a proposed or announced intention to do so) shall
not relieve the Company of its obligation hereunder to give notice of, convene
and hold the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last
seven (7) Business Days prior to the scheduled date of the Stockholders
Meeting as to the aggregate tally of affirmative proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, except as required by applicable Law, the adoption
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) which
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing and _Section 5.2_,
if, following the Offer Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up
Option, Parent and its affiliates shall own at least ninety percent (90%) of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take
all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer
to Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or its
affiliates, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Offer Closing without the Proxy Statement and the
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



44 Section 5.4. _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in connection with

all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons necessary
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging

restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated
or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and any other
transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall (A) as promptly as practicable

(I) make any other required submission under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger and (II)
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination or the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
possible and (B) make any filings, notifications or reports required under any
other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law of any
jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the
filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section
5.4(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their affiliates to,
promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each
and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and
waivers under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, with competent jurisdiction, so as to
enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date),
including (i) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if
such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting), by Order, consent
decree, hold separate order, trust, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license, disposition or hold separate of such assets or businesses of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates, or otherwise offering to take or offering to
commit to take any action (including any action that limits its freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or 

 



45  services of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) to the extent legally
permissible, and if the offer is accepted, taking or committing to take such

actions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) ( _provided_
, that the Company shall not be obligated to take any such action unless the
taking of such action is expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), in each
case, as may be necessary, required or advisable in order to obtain clearance
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of or to vacate or lift, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of restraining,
preventing or delaying the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid the commencement of any action
or proceeding that seeks to prohibit the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any Governmental
Authority requires the divestiture or the holding separate by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their affiliates of any assets or businesses, no adjustment
shall be made to the Merger Consideration and Parent, Merger Sub and their
affiliates shall be required to divest such assets and businesses, or hold
them separate, as the case may be, following the Merger Closing.

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall give (or shall cause its
respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts,
to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by _Section 5.4(a)_ and
_Section 5.4(b)_ that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
reimburse the Company for any reasonable expenses and costs incurred in
connection with the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.4(c)_. Each
of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will

including immediately informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting
in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement, in each case, other than as prohibited by
applicable Law and except for so-called 4(c) documents and other documents
customarily withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any Third Party
consents pursuant to this  _Section 5.4(c)_ shall not, in and of itself, be
considered a condition to the obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Offer or the Merger.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain
the Financing shall be solely as set forth in  _Section 5.12_.

 



46 Section 5.5. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, (y) upon reasonably prior
written notice and (z) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company
will provide to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during

violate any applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries of their normal duties. The parties shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 5.6(b)_, at any time prior to the earlier to occur of
the Offer Closing and obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board shall only be permitted to (y) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (z) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and terminate this Agreement under _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_
if and only if, in either case, (i) the Company Board has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Competing Proposal which did not, directly or indirectly,
arise from or in connection with any breach of _Section 5.6(a)_ or _Section
5.6(b)_ and that, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not take the actions in either
clause (y) or (z) above unless and until (A) the Company notifies Parent in
writing (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of taking such action, that the Company Board intends to take
the action in clause (y) or (z) above, as the case may be, which Notice of
Superior Proposal shall specify the identity of the party who made such
Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and shall attach the agreement and all related documentation
providing for such Superior Proposal; (B) after providing such Notice of
Superior Proposal and prior to taking such action in clause (y) or (z) above,
as the case may be, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
during such three (3) Business Days period (to the extent that Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantee as would permit the
Company Board (consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) not
to take such action in clause (y) or (z) above, as the case may be; and (C)
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantee offered in writing by
Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in
writing by Parent were to be given effect and that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal (or material change to the Intervening
Event) shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.6(e)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that references to the three (3) Business Days
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period with respect to any such amendment to a previous Superior Proposal (or
Intervening Event).

(f) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within forty-eight (48) hours, notify Parent and Merger Sub of receipt
by the Company of 

 



49  any Competing Proposal (or any inquiry or request for negotiating or
discussing a Competing Proposal) or any request for non-public information in
connection with any Competing Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Competing Proposal or request (including the identity of the Third
Party and, if applicable, copies of any documents relating to such Competing
Proposal ( _provided_ , that any fee letters may be redacted to the extent
required to comply with confidentiality provisions), and shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event on a daily basis) advise Parent and
Merger Sub of any material amendments to any such Competing Proposal or
request and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a daily basis of the
status and terms thereof. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with
any such Third Party which would prevent the Company from complying with the
provisions of this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof), directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender
or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Companys stockholders); (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Companys stockholders), in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with legal
advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (iii) complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law to make accurate disclosure to the Companys
stockholders of any factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any disclosures pursuant to clause (i) above other than an express
rejection of the applicable tender or exchange offer or an unqualified
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change. Between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, upon the written request by Parent (A)
following any disclosure specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above or (B)
in the event (x) a Competing Proposal has been made publicly known, (y) an
Intervening Event has been made publicly known or (z) any other event
or circumstance has occurred that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of the parties to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a
timely basis, the Company Board shall expressly publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following such request, and
failure to do so shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) The approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and/or the Support Agreements shall be irrevocable and unconditional while
this Agreement remains in effect and no Adverse Recommendation Change in and
of itself shall change such approval for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. To the extent Parent and/or the Company believes that there has been
a breach by a Third Party of any standstill provision to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to enforce such standstill provision to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 



50 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 5.6(b)_, but subject to
applicable Law, and in furtherance of _Section 5.6(a)_, the Company Board
shall not grant any waiver or release under any standstill agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company. The Company shall
enforce, and shall not release or permit the release of any person from, or
amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver,
termination or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or
similar agreement or provision to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
has any rights to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any inquiry, proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company as determined on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition (whether by
merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any
person directly or indirectly of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-
value basis; (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly,
by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person
beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Company Common Stock
or any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as
determined on a book-value basis; or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Competing Proposal
which is not solicited or received in violation of this _Section 5.6_ (with
all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty
percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial and
legal advisors, after taking into account all the terms of the Competing
Proposal (including price, form of consideration, conditionality, likelihood
of financing and regulatory clearance and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal on the terms proposed), are more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



51 (iii) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the Company
than the terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit the making
or amendment of a Competing Proposal or otherwise prohibit compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions of this _Section 5.6_.

Section 5.7. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its subsidiaries as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing
documents of the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates or in any written
agreement set forth on  _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _Indemnity Agreements_ ") shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. From and after the
Effective Time and for a period of at least six (6) years, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses (subject to
the person to whom expenses are advanced providing an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such person is not entitled to indemnification) to, any individual who,
on or prior to the Effective Time, was an officer, director or employee of
the Company or served on behalf of the Company as an officer, director or
employee of any of the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their
predecessors and the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries
and administrators of such officer, director or employee (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and required by (x) the Certificate of Incorporation,
the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of the
Companys subsidiaries or affiliates as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (y) the Indemnity Agreements, and (ii) not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify for a period of at least six (6) years any such provisions
referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees. The Company has
made available to Parent copies of the Indemnity Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Proceeding
arises out of or pertains to the fact that an Indemnitee is or was an officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity
(including any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to the Offer, the
Merger,

 



52  this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby), in each case,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; and (ii)
pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding the expenses
(including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.7(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any Proceeding for which indemnification may be
sought under this _Section 5.7(b)_ without the prior written consent of
each Indemnitee involved in such Proceeding unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such Proceeding and does not
include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee or such
Indemnitee otherwise consents (in such Indemnitees sole and absolute
discretion) in writing to such settlement, compromise, consent or termination.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any claim
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance
policies for any such year shall not be in excess of the maximum aggregate
annual premium contemplated by the immediately following sentence. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall be no breach
of this provision so long as (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are
insured under the Companys DandO Insurance as of the date hereof with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no
less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance policies in
excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage

 



53  available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if an Indemnitee is a party to or is
otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any Proceeding (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time with respect to which such Indemnitee was
entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses or insurance pursuant
to this _Section 5.7_, the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall continue
in effect with respect only to such Proceeding until the final disposition of
such Proceeding.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_. The provisions of this _Section 5.7_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
5.7_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 5.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing
documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company
or any of its subsidiaries.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.8_ to
the contrary, this _Section 5.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.7_.

Section 5.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
(b) any Proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its subsidiaries which relate to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to cause any Offer Condition or condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby not to be satisfied; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the delivery of any such notice shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of any Proceeding against the
Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



54 Section 5.9. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding
the transaction contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, and thereafter the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements (including conference calls with
investors and analysts) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such press
release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other parties
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule
or any listing agreement of any party hereto.

Section 5.10. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of
level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs
agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing benefits to any
employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (each a "
_Company_ Employee" and collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), including for purposes of accrual of
vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective affiliates (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement constitutes or shall be construed as
constituting an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of any Company Benefit
Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control,"
the earlier to occur of the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control."

 



55 (d) Each Company Employee who was participating in the Companys 2012
Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _MIP_ ") as of the date hereof
will continue to be eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the 2012 fiscal
year determined in accordance with the terms of the MIP as in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that Company performance in respect of
calculations made under the MIP shall be calculated without taking into
account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that
would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, and Parent hereby agrees (a) to
cause the individual target and maximum bonus opportunities to remain at
current levels in respect of the 2012 fiscal year and (b) to make any
adjustments to the 2012 fiscal year performance goals under the MIP that are
reasonably necessary to reflect the acquisition of the Company by Parent in a
manner that does not make it more difficult for such performance goals to be
achieved.

Section 5.11.  _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date hereof
and the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1_, Parent and Merger Sub shall refrain
(and shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent
shall, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt
this Agreement in its capacity as sole shareholder of Merger Sub and deliver
to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent approving
and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

Section 5.12. _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking
into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period), including using
its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to, and
within the control of, Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing, (iii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions) and
(iv) consummate the Debt Financing and, subject to the continued satisfaction
of the conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter and set forth in _Section
8.10(b)_, the Equity Financing, at or prior to the earlier to occur of the
Offer Closing and the Merger Closing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit
Merger Sub to, agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing
Commitment or any definitive agreements related to the Financing and/or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same or Alternative Financing

 



56  sources, in each case, without the Companys prior written consent to the
extent such amendments, modifications or waivers would either reduce the
aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Financing to fund the
amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (as
compared to the amount of such aggregate proceeds contemplated under the
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof), or impose new or
additional conditions precedent that would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent
or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Parent shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders and
other persons under the Financing Commitments, except for assignments and
replacements of an individual lender in accordance with the terms of the
syndication provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the Debt
Financing, or in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter
with respect to the Equity Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, Parent and Merger Sub may (without obtaining the Companys
consent) amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, if
the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate,
would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing
under the Debt Commitment Letter or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Upon any such amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
5.12(a)_, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and references to
"Financing Commitments" and "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under this
_Section 5.12(a)_ and references to "Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted
to be amended, supplemented or modified under this _Section 5.12(a)_.

(b) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly notify the Company
and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing from alternative
sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") upon terms (including any
flex provisions) no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger
Sub than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (and any related fee letter), in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event
(and, in any event, no later than the Offer Closing Date or the Merger Closing
Date, as applicable). In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained in
accordance with this  _Section 5.12(b)_, references to "Debt Financing,"
"Financing," "Debt Commitment Letter," "Equity Commitment Letter" and
"Financing Commitments" shall include such Alternative Financing,
as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.12_ shall require, and in no
event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity
Financing from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount
in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitment, or (ii)
pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing
Agreements (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or
otherwise).

 



57 (c) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of all documents related
to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment of
which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Financing source with respect to any (y) actual
or potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Financing or (z) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to
the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing at the
Merger Closing, and (iii) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related
to the Financing.

(d) Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, to Parent and
Merger Sub all reasonable cooperation in connection with the Financing, at
Parents sole expense, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the following:

(i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources with the
Essential Marketing Information and such other financial and other pertinent

Except as expressly provided in the immediately foregoing sentence, none of

its subsidiaries, affiliates or stockholders relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or

68  contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 7.2_ and
_Section 8.10_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_

Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_, Parent
shall have the right to seek to recover monetary damages (subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 7.2_) from the Company solely in the
event of a Willful Breach by the Company of the covenants and agreements set
forth in _Section 5.6_.

 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee and the Reverse
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent or their respective
affiliates, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 7.3_, such paying party
shall pay the other party its reasonable attorneys fees, costs and out-of-
pocket expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or
such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

Section 7.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement
of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
boards of directors at any time before or after the Offer Closing shall have
occurred or receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after the Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that
decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (b) after the
Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without such further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment
or change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

 



69 Section 7.5. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject
to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
subject to the proviso of _Section 7.4_, waive compliance with any agreement
or condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 7.6. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, but subject to  _Section 2.2(c)_, either Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid, all documentary, sales,

matter hereof.

Section 8.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as provided in
_Section 5.7_, (b) the provisions of _Article II_ (which, from and after the

parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.5_ without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the

 



76  parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware.

Section 8.10. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to _Section 7.3(d)_ and
_Section 8.10(b)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
the Equity Commitment Letter and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof and thereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that, subject to
_Section 8.10(b)_ and _Section 8.10(c)_, it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction. The provisions of  _Section 8.10(b)_ shall not
affect the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief described in this _Section
8.10(a)_, to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement (including under
_Section 5.4_ and _Section 5.12_) other than with respect to any and/or all
of the Consummation Events.

(b) Notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief described in
_Section 8.10(a)_, no such right may be enforced to cause the Offer or the
Merger to be consummated, the Offer Price or Merger Consideration to be paid
or the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) (each, a " _Consummation Event_ ") unless:

(i) with respect to the Offer and payment of the Offer Price and the Equity
Financing related thereto, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived as of the expiration of the Offer;

 



77 (ii) with respect to the Merger, the payment of the Merger Consideration
and the Equity Financing related thereto, all the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, each of which shall be
capable of being satisfied at the Merger Closing) have been satisfied or
waived;

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter have irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing
that the financing provided for in the Debt Financing will be funded at the
Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as applicable, if the Equity Financing
is funded at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as applicable; and

(iv) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the
Merger Closing, the Company has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed that
if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Merger Closing will occur.

(c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may concurrently seek specific performance or other
equitable relief in order to effect a Consummation Event and payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(a)(iii)_, under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance or other equitable relief in order to effect a
Consummation Event and payment of any monetary damages, including all or any
portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 8.10(c)_, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. Subject to _Section 8.10(b)_ and  _Section 8.10(c)_ each
of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or the Company, as
applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub, or
the Company, as applicable, under this Agreement. Subject to _Section
8.10(c)_, the parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this  _Section 8.10_, a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement (including the right to seek and recover damages for a
Willful Breach under  _Section 7.2_), the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Guarantee in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 8.10_
shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this  _Section 8.10_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages for a Willful Breach by
Parent or Merger Sub under _Section 7.2_ after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section
8.10_ or anything set forth in this _Section 8.10_ restrict or limit

 



78  any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of _Article VII_ (other than as set forth in _Section 8.10(c)_) or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement (including the right to seek and
recover damages for a Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub under _Section
7.2_), the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee that may be available
then or thereafter.

 

Section 8.11. _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (as applicable, the
" _Chosen Court_ "), for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in the
Chosen Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the providers of
the Debt Financing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a federal court located in Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

(b) Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this  _Section 8.11_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (b)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Court in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court and (d) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than the Chosen Court. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 8.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an

COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating
to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company
Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay
for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if:

(a) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common
Stock that represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the expiration of the Offer (the
" _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

(b) any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer or the consummation of the Merger shall not have expired or otherwise
been terminated;

 

(c) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

 

(i) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
or entered any Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
which is then in effect and has the effect of enjoining, making illegal or
otherwise prohibiting the making of the Offer, the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the consummation of the Merger, or preventing or prohibiting
the Offer or the Merger;

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth
in, _Section 3.4_ (Authority Relative to the Agreement), _Section 3.11(b)_
(Absence of Certain Changes or Events), _Section 3.21_ (Opinion of Financial
Advisor), _Section 3.22_ (Takeover Statutes) or _Section 3.23_ (Vote
Required) shall not be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Offer Closing with the same effect as though
made as of the Offer Closing, (B) set forth in _Section 3.3_
(Capitalization) shall not be true and correct in all material respects at and
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Offer Closing with the same
effect as though made as of the Offer Closing (except to the extent expressly
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date) and (C) set forth
in _Article III_ (other than the sections of _Article III_ referred to in
clause (A) or (B) above), without giving effect to any materiality or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications therein, shall not be true
and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Offer
Closing with the same effect as though made as of the Offer Closing (except
to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
date), except in the case of clause (C) for such failures to be true and
correct as would not have or reasonably   be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; _provided_ , solely for purposes of clause (B) above, if one
or more inaccuracies in  _Section 3.3_ would be reasonably likely to cause
the aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer, the Merger, exercise the Top-Up Option, refinance the indebtedness
of the Company, acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding
equity interests in the Companys subsidiaries and pay all fees and expenses
in connection therewith to increase by $500,000 or more, such inaccuracy or
inaccuracies will be considered material for purposes of clause (B) of this
clause (c)(ii);

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement on or prior to the Offer
Closing; or

 

(iv) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
or

 

(d) Parent (either directly or through its subsidiaries) shall not have
received the proceeds of the Debt Financing and the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter shall not have definitively and irrevocably confirmed to
Parent and the Merger Sub that the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein will be available at the Offer Closing on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Proceeds Condition_ ");
or

(e) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to ensure
that Parent or Merger Sub owns at least ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately after the Offer
Closing, (i) there shall exist under applicable Law any restriction or legal
impediment on Merger Subs ability and right to exercise the Top-Up Option
(the " _Top-Up Impediment_ ") or (ii) the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option together with the shares validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn are insufficient for Merger
Sub to reach at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock immediately after the Offer Closing (after giving effect to such
exercise).

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition and the
condition set forth in clause (e)(ii) have been satisfied, Parent and Merger
Sub shall include for purposes of its determination thereof shares tendered in
the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures if and only if shares
have been delivered pursuant to such guarantees as of the Expiration Date.

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate,
signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer or another
senior officer, certifying that none of the conditions set forth in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of paragraph (c) above shall have occurred and be continuing
as of the expiration of the Offer. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law,
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by
Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

8\. _Limitation on Liability_. The directors of the Corporation shall
be entitled to the benefits of all limitations on the liability of directors
generally that are now or hereafter become available under the Delaware

it is permitted to indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no director of the Corporation shall
be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption
from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time. The Corporation may,
in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, provide
indemnification to such of the employees and agents of the Corporation to such
extent and to such effect as the Board of Directors shall determine to be
appropriate and authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

The Corporation shall indemnify, advance expenses, and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists and may
hereafter by amended, any person (and the heirs, executors or administrators
of such person) (a " _Covered Person_ ") who was or is made or is threatened
to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "),
by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or
nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys
fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, except for claims for indemnification (following the final
disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses not paid in full,
the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection
with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person against
the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was
authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 8 shall also include
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in connection
with any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the fullest
extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her or on
his or her behalf and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or
arising out of his or her status as such,  whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her
against such liability under the provisions of this Section 8, provided that
such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be
made by the Board of Directors.

The rights and authority conferred in this Section 8 shall not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may otherwise have or hereafter acquire.

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 8, nor the adoption of any
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any modification of law
shall eliminate or reduce, or otherwise have an adverse effect on, any right
or protection of this Section 8 in respect of any Proceeding (regardless of
when such Proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out
of, or related to, any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment,
repeal, adoption or modification.
