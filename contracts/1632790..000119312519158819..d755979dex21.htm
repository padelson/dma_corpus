Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of Varta Companies Equity Interests_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Seller shall (or, as applicable, shall cause the Subsidiary
Transferors to) sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser (or,
as applicable, one or more Affiliates of Purchaser designated by Purchaser not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), and
either Purchaser (or, as applicable, such Affiliates of Purchaser) shall
purchase and accept from Seller (or, as applicable, the Subsidiary Transferors
all of (i) the Subsidiary Transferors right, title and interest in the Varta
Companies Equity Interests, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Liens, Liens arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Liens created by
or through Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, Liens related to applicable
securities Laws or any Lien arising under the organizational documents of a
Varta Company, correct and materially complete copies of which have been made
available to Purchaser, and (ii) all of Sellers and its Subsidiaries right,
title and interest in any Transferred Assets which are not held by a
Transferred Entity, but by Seller or any of its other Subsidiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) the property and assets of the Transferred Entities
constituting Transferred Assets shall transfer to Purchaser automatically by
operation of Law upon the sale of the Varta Companies Equity Interests, and
(ii) the Seller shall be responsible for and hold the Purchaser harmless from
any failure by the Subsidiary Transferors to sell, transfer, convey, assign
and deliver the Varta Companies Equity Interests and Transferred Assets in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to the Retained SBAA
Business, Seller and its Affiliates own and operate other businesses and sell
products (for clarity, other than the sale of Varta-branded Products in EMEA),
including other battery, chargers, portable power and lighting business and
battery products in EMEA and elsewhere in the world, and which,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, are not
the subject of, nor being sold, conveyed or transferred under, nor any
interest conveyed or assigned, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.02 _Assumption of Assumed Liabilities; Retention of Retained
Liabilities_ _._

 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates designated by Purchaser in writing pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_ to) by virtue of the acquisition of the Transferred Entities
indirectly assume all Assumed Liabilities of such Transferred Entities. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Liabilities of the Transferred
Entities constituting Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed by Purchaser
automatically by operation of Law upon the sale and transfer of the Varta
Company Equity Interests.

 

(b) At the Closing, Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, shall keep or assume at the Closing and remain or become at the Closing
obligated to pay, perform and discharge when due all Retained Liabilities.

Section 2.03 _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_ _._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in consideration
for the sale and transfer of the Varta Companies Equity Interests under
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (or,
as applicable, one or more Affiliates of Seller designated by Seller not less
than five (5) Business

 



29

    

 Days prior to the Closing Date as the transferor of the relevant Varta
Company Equity Interests or Transferred Assets on the Closing Date) an amount
of cash equal to One Hundred Eighty Million Euros (180,000,000) (the "
_Unadjusted Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ __ (A) the amount equal to the Modified
Working Capital _minus_ the Working Capital Target _plus_ __ (B) the amount,
which may be positive or negative, equal to the Closing Net Indebtedness,
_minus_ (C) the amount equal to the Closing Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (D)
the Pension Plan Purchase Price Adjustment, _minus_ (E) the RandD
Alkaline Capex Purchase Price Adjustment, _minus_ (F) the Stranded Costs
Purchase Price Adjustment (the Unadjusted Purchase Price, so adjusted, the "
_Purchase Price_ "). _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets out those items of Indebtedness that the Seller and Purchaser have agreed
are to be treated as Funded Indebtedness.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " shall mean
an amount equal to the Unadjusted Purchase Price  _plus_ __ (A) the amount
equal to the Estimated Modified Working Capital _minus_ the Working Capital
Target, _plus_ __ (B) the amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to
the Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the amount equal to the
Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (D) the amount of the
Estimated Pension Plan Purchase Price Adjustment, _minus_ (E) the RandD Alkaline
Capex Purchase Price Adjustment, _minus_ (F) the Stranded Costs Purchase
Price Adjustment. For purposes of determining the amount of cash to be paid as
the Estimated Purchase Price by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)(ii)_: (I) the amount of Closing Net Indebtedness for
the purposes of the Estimated Purchase Price shall be equal to the amount
identified in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter as the
" _Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness_ " and shall then be subject to
adjustment following the Closing Date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and
using the methodology set out in  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, and (II) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, not
less than five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, a written statement
certified by an officer of Seller (the " _Closing Notice_ ") setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of: (i) the Modified Working Capital (such
amount, the " _Estimated Modified Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Closing
Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_ ") and (iii)
the Estimated Purchase Price. Seller agrees that it shall prepare such Closing
Notice in accordance with, as applicable, the definition of "Closing
Transaction Expenses" and, in the case of the Estimated Modified Working
Capital, such Closing Notice shall be prepared in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and Seller shall deliver together
with such Closing Notice any reasonable supporting material with respect to
any estimated amounts used by Seller in calculating the amounts set forth on
such Closing Notice. Purchaser shall have three (3) Business Days from the
receipt of the Closing Notice to provide Seller any comments with respect to
the computation of any of the components of Estimated Modified Working Capital
and Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, which comments shall be considered
by Seller in good faith (it being understood that Seller shall be under no
obligation to revise such Closing Notice in response to Purchasers comments).
In the event Seller revises such Closing Notice in response to Purchasers
comments, the revised statement incorporating revised estimates of the
Estimated Modified Working Capital, Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness and
Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, as applicable, shall be treated as the
Closing Notice hereunder.

 

(c) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter. Within sixty (60) days after the Purchase Price shall have been deemed
to be final pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ below, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a certificate that reasonably allocates the Purchase Price and the
Assumed Liabilities among the Transferred Entities (or the assets thereof in
the case of any Transferred Entity the assets of which are treated as being
acquired by Purchaser or any of its designated Affiliates for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_

 



30

    

  _Certificate_ "). Purchaser shall have a period of twenty (20) days after
the delivery of the Allocation Certificate (the " _Response Period_ ") to
present in writing to Seller notice of any objections Purchaser may have to
the allocation set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless
Purchaser timely objects, such Allocation Certificate shall be binding on the
parties without further adjustment, absent manifest error. If Purchaser
raises any objections within the Response Period, Purchaser and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such
dispute. If the parties fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of the Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved
by the Accounting Arbitrator, whose determination shall be final and binding
on the parties. The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve the dispute within
thirty (30) days after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser. Except as otherwise required by a final determination (within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or similar provision of applicable
Tax law or any other event (including the execution of a Form 870-AD) that
finally and conclusively establishes the amount of any liability for Tax), (i)
Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries,
or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to) report the national,
federal, state, provincial and local income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Certificate, and (ii) neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (and
neither party shall permit its respective Subsidiaries to) take a position
inconsistent with the Allocation Certificate on any Tax Return or filings
(including any forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the
Code). Each of Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with the other in
preparing any statements required by any Governmental Authority charged
with the collection of any income Tax for filing within a reasonable period
before its filing due date. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)_ to the contrary, to the extent it is necessary to allocate the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the Transferred
Entities (or any subset thereof) prior to the final determination of the
Allocation Certificate in connection with any of the transactions governed by
the Foreign Acquisition Agreements (or other local closing agreements and
documents required to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby), each
of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their Subsidiaries to)
reasonably cooperate in good faith to agree upon such allocation in a manner
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

Section 2.04  _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth
certain current trade assets and current trade Liabilities accounts and
certain accounting principles, methodologies and policies used in the
determination of such accounts. Such accounts of the Transferred Entities,
cumulatively, as of immediately before the effective time of the Closing (as
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_), determined in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and the principles,
methodologies and policies set forth therein __ and, to the extent not set
forth therein, in accordance with the Accounting Principles, shall constitute
the " _Modified Working Capital_ ". For the avoidance of doubt, amounts
included in the determination of Closing Net Indebtedness, Closing
Transaction Expenses, Pension Plan Purchase Price Adjustment, RandD Alkaline
Capex Purchase Price Adjustment, and Stranded Costs Purchase Price Adjustment
and any amounts that are to be reimbursed by Seller to Purchaser or any
Transferred Entity pursuant to this Agreement or agreements entered into in
connection herewith shall be excluded from the determination of the Modified
Working Capital so that there are no duplications in deductions
when determining the Purchase Price.

(b) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ __ is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the total amount of such deficit, and if the Purchase
Price as finally determined in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ __
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the total
amount of such excess, in either case by wire

 



31

    

 transfer of immediately available Euro funds, within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination of the Purchase Price (or in the case of that
portion of the Purchase Price equal to the Excess Cash, as defined in Section
2.04 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, within six months of the Closing Date),
to an account designated by the party receiving payment no later than two (2)
Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase Price.

(c) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within one-hundred
and twenty (120) days after the Closing), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement setting forth Purchasers calculation of (i) Modified
Working Capital, (ii) Closing Net Indebtedness, (iii) Closing
Transaction Expenses, (iv) Pension Plan Purchase Price Adjustment and (v) the
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ __ (the " _Closing
Statement_ "), which shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles, methodologies and policies set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter _(_ and, to the extent not set forth therein, in
accordance with the Accounting Principles). The parties agree to provide each
other and their respective Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to their respective books, records,
work papers and personnel (and any other information which either
party reasonably requests to the extent relating to the Business (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Business in any Deferred Transfer
Jurisdictions)) throughout the periods during which the Closing Statement is
being prepared or evaluated and any disputes that may arise under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ __ are being resolved, in each case in a manner that
does not interfere unreasonably with the operations of such partys
businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
be required to (x) violate any obligation of confidentiality to which
Purchaser or Seller may be subject in discharging their obligations pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, including any commitments made by
Seller in connection with the Remedy, and (y) provide access to or disclose
information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or contravene any
applicable Laws. If Seller disagrees with the determination of the Closing
Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing of such disagreement
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, which written
notice shall set forth any such disagreement in reasonable detail ("
_Disagreement Notice_ "). If Seller fails to deliver a Disagreement Notice by
the end of such sixty (60)-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser, and the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties. Matters included in the
calculations in the Closing Statement to which Seller does not object in the
Disagreement Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall not be
subject to further dispute or review. If Seller delivers a Disagreement Notice
by the end of such thirty (30)-day period, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and
binding upon the parties.

 

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)_ __ within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Seller of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly select a mutually acceptable recognized third party accounting firm
with sufficient experience in international transactions, the retention of
which will not give rise to present or potential future auditor independence
problems for Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, as determined by the reasonable discretion of Seller and
Purchaser, to resolve such disagreement (the firm so selected shall be
referred to herein as the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). In the event that
Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the appointment of the Accounting
Arbitrator, as provided above, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
appointed, at the request of either Purchaser or Seller, by the Chartered
Institute of Arbitrators in London, which Accounting Arbitrator shall be
another recognized third party accounting firm with sufficient experience in
international transactions. The parties shall instruct the Accounting
Arbitrator to consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Closing

 



32

    

 Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a Disagreement
Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their disagreement. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance with the terms
hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies, practices,
classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or procedures used
to prepare the Closing Statement, and whether there were mathematical errors
in the calculation of the Closing Statement, and the Accounting Arbitrator
shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Arbitrator shall make
its determination based solely on written submissions, presentations and
supporting material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not pursuant to any
independent review. In resolving any such disagreement, the Accounting
Arbitrator may only select an amount for each item in dispute that is within
range of values established for such disputed item as determined by reference
to the value assigned to such item by Seller in the Disagreement Notice and by
Purchaser in the Closing Statement. Purchaser and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Arbitrator to
deliver to all parties, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting
forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
parties, absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator arising in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall be
borne by Purchaser and Seller in equal parts (50/50).

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ __ shall be allocated in a manner consistent with any
allocation agreed to pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_.

 

(f) With respect to Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and Modified
Working Capital of the Business denominated in currencies other than Euros,
the Applicable Exchange Rate for each such currency as of immediately before
the effective time of the Closing as published by Bloomberg (BGN New York),
shall be used to convert such amounts into Euros for purposes of determining
Closing Net Indebtedness and Modified Working Capital in connection with the
adjustments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ _._

 

(g) Without duplication for any other amounts payable under this Agreement (or
adjusted in calculating the Purchase Price), Seller shall reimburse or pay to
Purchaser the amounts calculated and determined in accordance with Section
2.04(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. All such amounts so reimbursed or
paid shall be treated as a deduction to the Purchase Price. The obligations
of Seller under this Section 2.04(g) shall expire twelve months following the
Closing Date and, thereafter, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) shall have no rights to invoice or claim against
Seller under this Section 2.04(g) or pursuant to Section 2.04(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter.

Section 2.05 ___The Closing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section_
__ _ 2.05(b)_), the sale and purchase of the Varta Companies Equity
Interests (and thereby the indirect sale and purchase of the Transferred
Assets and the indirect assumption of the Assumed Liabilities) (all as
contemplated hereby, the " _Closing_ ") shall take place by electronic
exchange of documents (unless original signatures, notarization or other
formalities are required under applicable Laws to effect the transfer), (i) on
the first (1st) Business Day of the month following the third (3rd) Business
Day following satisfaction or waiver in writing (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the party entitled to the benefit thereof of all of the
conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in _Article IX_ (other
than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied only at the
Closing, but subject to the written waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the party entitled to the benefit thereof or fulfillment of
those conditions), or (ii) at such other time and date or at such other place
as Seller and

 



33

    

 Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing
takes place being the " _Closing Date_ "). The parties agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to procure that the Closing shall occur within three
(3) months from receipt of the approval referred to in _Sections_ __ _
9.01(c)_ and _9.02(c)._ For the sake of clarity, the transfer of the Varta
Companies Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities
will be deemed to occur in each jurisdiction at 12:01 A.M. local time, on the
day of the Closing Date (x) in the case of Varta Companies Equity Interests,
in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Varta Company or (y) in the case
of Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, where the Transferred Asset and
Assumed Liability resides, exists or arises.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) despite
the exercise by Seller of its reasonable best efforts, the Pre-Closing
Restructuring has not been completed in any applicable jurisdiction as of the
Closing, or (ii) either party determines, in good faith, that it is not
reasonably practicable to consummate the sale and transfer of the Varta
Companies Equity Interests in a particular jurisdiction on the Closing Date
(each such jurisdiction in which the circumstances described in clauses (i)
and (ii) above apply, a " _Deferred Transfer Jurisdiction_ "), then Purchaser
and Seller shall, subject to this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.05(c)_, agree to defer (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) the
consummation of the portion of the transactions contemplated in such Deferred
Transfer Jurisdiction solely with respect to the sale and transfer of the
Varta Companies Equity Interests in respect of such Deferred Transfer
Jurisdiction (such items for each Deferred Transfer Jurisdiction, the "
_Deferred Equity Interests_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the
written consent of the other party, in no event shall either party have the
right to defer the consummation of the sale and transfer of the Varta
Companies Equity Interests, (x) in the member countries of the European Union
or (y) if such deferral would result in the Deferred Transfer Jurisdictions
accounting for 10% or more of the net sales of the Business in fiscal year
2018.

(c) From and after the Closing, and until such time as the applicable Deferred
Equity Interests have been transferred to Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.05(b)_ (each, a " _Deferred Transfer Closing_ "), such Deferred Equity

the extent resulting from or arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or violation of applicable Law by Seller or its Affiliates,
Purchaser shall defend and indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons and save
and hold each of them harmless against any Losses incurred, sustained or
suffered by them arising out of or as a result of the performance by Seller

after the Closing until the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

(d) The Deferred Transfer Closing of any Deferred Equity Interests shall occur
as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the resolution of the
applicable circumstance described in clauses (i) through (ii) of the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ that caused such jurisdiction to be a

agree upon in writing. In

paid on such Deferred Transfer Closing by Purchasers designated Affiliate to
the applicable Subsidiary Transferor in local currency: (a) at the Deferred
Transfer Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable designated
Affiliate to, deliver such portion of the Purchase Price by wire transfer in

Section 2.07 _Accounting_ _(Wrong Pockets)_. If and to the extent that, after
the Closing, (a) Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any payment that
is properly for the account of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities or in relation to any
Transferred Assets) according to the terms of this Agreement (including any
payment in respect of or under any Excluded Asset or otherwise due to Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries) or, with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment on behalf of Purchaser or
any of its designated Affiliate(s) (including any payment in respect of or
under any Assumed Liability or otherwise payable by the Business), Purchaser
shall promptly deliver such amount to Seller, and (b) Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred
Entities) receives any payment that is properly for the account of Purchaser,
the Transferred Entities or any of its other Affiliates according to the
terms of this Agreement (including any payment otherwise due to the

Seller, Purchaser, a Transferred Entity or any of its other Affiliates
makes a payment on behalf of Seller (including any payment in respect of or
under any Retained Liability or otherwise payable by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries), Seller shall promptly deliver such amount to Purchaser or the
respective Transferred Entity, in each case, pursuant to a mutually agreed
weekly cash reconciliation and off-set process conducted by the parties. All
amounts due and payable under this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ _ _ shall be due and
payable by the applicable party in immediately available funds, by wire
transfer to the account designated in writing by the other party.

 

Section 2.08 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser or any of its
designated Affiliates is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of state, local or applicable Tax
Law; _provided_ that Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller of any
expected deduction or withholding at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
withholding (which notice shall specify the legal authority and the
calculation method for the expected withholding); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with Seller (including by
providing Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable
certificates, forms or documentation that would reduce or eliminate any such
deduction or withholding) and shall

 



36

    

 otherwise take such steps as Seller may reasonably request to reduce or
eliminate, such requirement to withhold Tax. To the extent that such amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Authority, such
withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors (as
applicable) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

Section 2.09 _Foreign_ _Acquisition Agreements_. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, at the Closing, the parties shall, or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, enter into such agreements and instruments
(collectively, the " _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_ ") providing for the
sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment or delivery of any Varta Companies
Equity Interest and thereby indirectly transfer of the Transferred Assets
and/or indirect assumption of the Assumed Liabilities as the parties jointly
determine would be required or advisable pursuant to, or to comply
with, requirements of applicable local Law to be documented separately from
this Agreement, which Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall be in the forms set
out in _Exhibit_ __ _ D_ and have appropriate provisions to pay the
applicable portion of the Purchase Price, as applicable, in local currency if
necessary (which local currency payments, including any adjustment thereof,
will reduce the corresponding obligation to make payment of the Purchase Price
to Seller under this Agreement, and Seller shall promptly reimburse any
excess Purchase Price payment received or Purchaser shall promptly pay to
Seller any under-payment as the case may be, in case of such local currency
payments) in such amounts and such countries as jointly determined by the
parties. Any amounts payable in local currency shall be determined by
reference to the applicable spot rate published by Bloomberg (BGN New York) as
of 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that (x) nothing in the Foreign Acquisition
Agreements, express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to
replace, substitute, modify, expand, qualify or limit in any way the terms of
this Agreement and (y) to the extent that any provision of any Foreign
Acquisition Agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, this Agreement will govern.

Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes Sellers, and each Ancillary Agreement
to which Seller or its Subsidiary is, or is specified to be, a party will,
after execution and delivery by Seller or its Subsidiary (as the case may
be), constitute Sellers and such Subsidiarys legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law.

requirements necessary to maintain the validity and enforceability thereof.
Subject to (i) _ Section_ __ _ 6.07_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, and (ii)

any restriction binding upon Purchaser or its pre-Closing Affiliates,
including their granting of any Lien in any Acquired Intellectual Property).

 

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries together hold all rights, title and interest

Property of any Person; or, (ii) other than as set forth on _Section_ __ _
4.14(c)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, challenge the validity,
enforceability or ownership of or licensed rights under any Acquired
Intellectual Property, except in connection with any ordinary course

Acquired Intellectual Property are being infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated by any Person.

(d) Seller and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable legal actions
to obtain, maintain, enforce or otherwise protect the Acquired Intellectual
Property owned by the Transferred Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries,
including making filings and payments of maintenance, renewal or similar fees
for registered, issued or pending Acquired Intellectual Property, and have
taken reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of all trade
secrets within the Acquired Intellectual Property. The Transferred Entities,
and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable actions to maintain the validity
and enforceability of the Acquired Intellectual Property licensed by
Transferred Entities to another Person. No current or former Representative of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has any legal and enforceable right, title,

Subsidiaries in connection with the Acquired Intellectual Property.

 

(e) The Transferred Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries are in material
compliance with all applicable Privacy and Information Security Requirements
and all applicable contractual obligations regarding the Processing,

of Seller and its Subsidiaries (e.g., posted privacy policies; notices
provided in connection with the Processing of Personal Data; posted policies
or notices concerning the security of Information Technology systems,
collectively referred to as " _Privacy Policies_ "); and internal policies
and standards concerning the treatment of Personal Data and/or the security of
Information Technology systems), and, to Sellers Knowledge, no Person has
gained unauthorized access to or made any unauthorized use of any such
Personal Data. Each of Seller

 



54

    

 and its Subsidiaries has implemented, and has required all third party
service providers that are a party to any Privacy Contract to implement,
adequate security measures in place to protect Personal Data collected or
Processed in connection with the Business that is stored in their Information
Technology equipment and other computer systems from unlawful use or access by
any third party or any other use by a third party that would violate the
applicable Privacy Policy or Privacy Contract (as applicable). The execution,
delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby do not violate any Privacy and
Information Security Requirements, Privacy Contract or any Privacy Policy as
it currently exists or as it existed at any time during which any Personal
Data was collected or Processed in connection with the Business (to the extent
such Privacy Policy still governs the use of such Personal Data). Upon the
Closing, Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred Entities will own all
such Personal Data and continue to have the right to use such Personal Data on
substantially similar terms and conditions as the Transferred Entities,
Seller and its Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing, subject
to Purchasers compliance with applicable Law and except for any restrictions
binding upon Purchaser or its pre-Closing Affiliates (including their
granting of any Lien relating thereto). No Actions are pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened against the Transferred Entities, Seller or
its Subsidiaries relating to the collection or Processing of Personal Data in
connection with the Business.

(f) The Transferred Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries have not received
any, and to the Knowledge of Seller, there has not been any Action (whether
formal or informal) against, the Transferred Entities, Seller, its
Subsidiaries, or any customers of the Transferred Entities, Seller or
its Subsidiaries (in the case of customers, to the extent relating to the
Business), by any private party or any regulatory or other governmental body
or official, foreign or domestic, regarding the Processing of Personal Data,
and no such Action has been threatened in writing against the Transferred
Entities, Seller or its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Seller, no facts or
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such an
Action insofar as such Action relates to the Transferred Entities, Seller or
its Subsidiaries. Except for such consents as are required under applicable
Laws, the Privacy Policies do not require the delivery of any notice to or
consent from any Person, or prohibit the transfer of any Personal Data
collected and in the possession or control of Seller or its Subsidiaries, in
connection with the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Each employee and agent of the Transferred Entities, Seller and its
Subsidiaries performing work as part of the Business has received training
regarding information security that is relevant to each such employees or
agents role and responsibility within the Business. The Transferred Entities,

or other appropriate security strategies on all portable devices and
information systems containing either Personal Data or confidential
information of the Transferred Entities, Seller or such Subsidiary.

 

(h) Each of the Transferred Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries is using
reasonable efforts in prosecuting all patent applications and all other
Intellectual Property applications to register Intellectual Property it has
filed which are included in the Acquired Intellectual Property consistent with
Sellers and its Subsidiaries past practices. Each of the
Transferred Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries is using reasonable efforts
in preparing to file patent and other Intellectual Property applications for
all inventions in a manner and within a sufficient time period to avoid
statutory disqualification of any potential patent or other Intellectual
Property application included in the Acquired Intellectual Property consistent
with the Transferred Entities, Sellers and its Subsidiaries past practices
but, in any event, only in instances where Seller or one of its Subsidiaries
has determined that it wishes to attempt to seek patent protection. To
Sellers Knowledge, all prior art material to the patentability of the claims
in any 

 



55

    

 issued or applied-for patents included in the Acquired Intellectual Property
is, to the extent required under applicable Law, disclosed or otherwise
cited during prosecution in the respective issued patents, applications or
associated file histories thereof included in the Acquired Intellectual
Property, and, to Sellers Knowledge, there is no other material prior art
with respect thereto that was not disclosed in accordance with applicable
Law.

(i) _Section_ __ _ 4.14(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all material Software constituting Owned

any Malicious Code designed to permit unauthorized access or to disable or
otherwise harm any computer, systems or Software, or any Software routine

this Agreement and the Information Technology owned, controlled, licensed,
leased, used or subscribed to by the Transferred Entities as of the Closing

to the extent currently conducted. The Transferred Information Technology is
adequate for, and operates and performs in all material respects as required

with any Acquired Intellectual Property, or (C) used FOSS in such a way that,
with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 4.14(j)_, creates, or purports to create
obligations for the Transferred Entities with respect to any Acquired
Intellectual Property, or grants, or purports to grant, to any third party any
rights or immunities under any Acquired Intellectual Property (including but
not limited to using any FOSS that requires, as a condition of use,
modification and/or distribution of such FOSS, such that other Software
incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such FOSS must be (1)
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (2) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works or (3) be redistributable at no charge). _Section_
__ _ 4.14(j)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of all Software constituting FOSS incorporated into, combined
with, linked to, used with, or distributed with any of the Products, and the
corresponding FOSS license applicable thereto.

 

(k) The source code for all Material Software is and has been maintained in
confidence. Consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
trigger any requirement or obligation for the Transferred Entities, Purchaser,
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to release source code for Material Software
from a source code escrow to a third party or otherwise provide or license
such source code to a third party.

 



56

    

(l) All Transferred Information Technology, and, with respect to the Business,
Sellers and the Transferred Entities related procedures and practices, are
designed, implemented, operated and maintained in accordance with customary
industry standards and practices for entities operating businesses similar to

Security Requirements and Privacy Policies. There has been no failure
or other material substandard performance of any Information Technology of
Seller and its Subsidiaries which has caused any material disruption to the
Business. With respect to the Business, neither any of the Transferred
Entities, nor Seller nor any of the Transferred Entities, nor any Transferred
Information Technology, have suffered any material data loss, business
interruption, or other harm as a result of, any Malicious Code intentionally
designed to permit (i) unauthorized access to a computer or network, (ii)
unauthorized disablement or erasure of Software, hardware or data, or (iii)
any other similar type of unauthorized activities. To Sellers Knowledge,
there have been no unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security with
respect to any of the Transferred Information Technology. The Transferred
Entities, Seller and its Subsidiaries have implemented any and all security
patches or upgrades that are generally available for the Transferred
Information Technology.

makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c), where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not and would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Purchaser and each

respective obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as
applicable, or prevent, hinder or materially delay the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

except, in the case of each of  _clauses_ __ _ (b)_ through _(e)_ , where
such conflict, violation, breach, termination, default, requirement,
acceleration, increase in obligations, adverse modification or creation of

its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.06 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Purchaser_ has delivered to Seller complete and correct copies of the
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
between Purchaser and the financial institutions identified therein and the
executed fee letters, fee credit letters and engagement letters associated
therewith (provided, that the amounts and percentages in the fee letter
related to fees, certain other economic terms and the "flex" provisions
included therein, but only to the extent that none of such provisions would
adversely affect conditionality, may be redacted) (such commitment letter,
together with all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments
thereto and any related redacted fee letters, collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Financing Sources have agreed to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof and except to the extent
otherwise permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, (x) the Debt Financing
Commitment has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived
since copies thereof were delivered to Seller, (y) no such amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver is contemplated and (z) the commitment
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are, and are
contemplated to be, no other agreements, side letters or arrangements (oral
or written) relating to the Debt Financing Commitment (other than customary
engagement letters or as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment
furnished to Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(a)_, but in each
case of the foregoing, which do not adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination, principal amount or availability of the Debt
Financing). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment is in full
force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of
each of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at Law, and provided that, other than as expressly set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment, there are no conditions or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing (including any
"flex" provisions. Assuming (A) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance
with the Debt Financing Commitment, (B) the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ , and (C) performance by
Seller and its Subsidiaries of their obligations that are required to be
performed prior to the Closing, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed
pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
together with Purchasers unrestricted cash on hand and other access to
capital, in the aggregate will be sufficient for Purchaser to pay the
Estimated Purchase Price on the Closing Date, any payment required to be made
by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ (if any) and all related fees
and expenses and any other payment contemplated in this Agreement and the
Debt Financing Commitment. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ and performance by Seller and
its Subsidiaries of their obligations under this Agreement, as of the date
hereof, (I) no event has occurred that would result in any breach or violation
of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) by Purchaser under the Debt Financing Commitment
and (II) Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment will not be satisfied or that the
proceeds of the Debt Financing will not be available to Purchaser on the
Closing Date. Purchaser has fully paid or has caused to be fully paid all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment.

 

(b) The obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding the ability of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any
other Person to obtain financing for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



64

    

Section 5.07 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions
to Purchasers obligation to consummate the Acquisition, and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing and the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price on the Closing Date,
any payment required to be made by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.04_ and all related fees and expenses and any other payment contemplated in
this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment and (b) any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Financing
Commitment, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent
as of the Closing and immediately after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination (x) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities
of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date,
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable Liabilities of such Person on
its existing debts (including contingent and other Liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

Section 5.08 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_ _; Non-Reliance
on Seller Estimates_.

(a) _Except_ for the representations and warranties contained in _Article
III_ and _Article IV_ , in the Ancillary Agreements or in certificates
delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(v)_, Purchaser
acknowledges that neither Seller nor any other Person (i) is making or has
made any representation or warranty (whether express or implied) on behalf of
Seller, any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, or any of their respective Representatives in
connection with the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby and (ii) except as expressly otherwise provided herein or in
the Transaction Documents, will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Purchaser resulting from the delivery,
dissemination or any other distribution to Purchaser or any of its
Representatives, or the use by Purchaser or any of its Representatives, of
any materials, documentation estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information, business plans or other oral or other information during
the course of due diligence or any auction or negotiation process
(including information memoranda, VDR materials, projections, estimates,
management presentations, budgets and financial data and reports).

(b)  _Without_ limitation of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_ , in the Ancillary Agreements or in
certificates delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.06(a)(v)_, Purchaser acknowledges that in connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Business (including the Transferred Entities) by
Purchaser, Purchaser has received and may continue to receive from Seller, its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Business and its operations;
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in
such business plans,

 



65

    

 with which Purchaser is familiar; and that Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans, so furnished to Purchaser (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Purchaser
has not relied on such information.

Section 6.02 _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing, and under the

conducted in a manner that complies with _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ __ and

supervision of Sellers personnel and in such a manner as to maintain
confidentiality and not to interfere with the normal operations of the
businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this or any other agreement between Purchaser and Seller executed on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its
Representatives, or provide Purchaser or its Representatives with, (a) any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or predecessors, or any related material, except to the
extent that any

 



67

    

 such Tax Return or related material relates solely to the Transferred
Entities, the Business or the Transferred Assets, (b) any information if
making such information available would (i) reasonably be likely to result in
a waiver of any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii) contravene
the Remedy, any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including
any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a
party) (it being understood that Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable
efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required
disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing privilege
or contravening such Law, duty or agreement), or (c) any information that is
not in the possession or control of Seller or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.03 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall comply with, and shall cause their respective

Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2018, between Seller and Purchaser, as
amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that such
obligations shall be subject to any exceptions expressly set forth herein,
including the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference
(subject to any exceptions expressly set forth herein, including the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_) and shall continue in full force and
effect and survive the Closing in accordance with its terms. From and after
the Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of Protected
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to Purchaser or its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives in respect of any information solely to the
extent relating to the Business, the Transferred Entities (after giving effect
to the Pre-Closing Restructuring), the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement, and Purchasers obligations thereunder
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in all respects. In the event of any conflict between the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control
until the termination of this Agreement without the Closing having occurred.

(b) The timing and content of the initial public announcement regarding this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby to the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in
advance by Seller and Purchaser; _provided_ that if any subsequent public
disclosure is required by applicable Law, U.S. GAAP, IFRS or by the rules and
regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock exchange or trading
system to be made by Purchaser or Seller and would vary in any material
respect from the initial agreed upon public announcement, such party shall
be permitted to issue such public disclosure only if it has provided the
other party with reasonable advance notice and opportunity to review and
comment on such disclosure. Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) not to, issue any broadly
distributed communication of a general nature to employees of the Business
(including general communications relating to benefits and compensation)
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
providing Purchaser with reasonable advance notice and opportunity to review
and comment on such communication.

 

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to
Occur_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall (and each of them shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done and
cooperate with each other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or
advisable (including by

 



68

    

 cooperating in advance of any potential filing contemplated by the second
succeeding sentence) to consummate the Closing as promptly as practicable,
including using their reasonable best efforts: (x) to cause the preparation
and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Closing and the taking of all other such reasonable actions as
are necessary or advisable to obtain any requisite approvals, authorizations,
consents, clearances, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions or
waivers, to avoid an Action by, or to lift any injunction or other legal bar
to the consummation of the Acquisition by any third party or
Governmental Authority relating to Review Laws in the Specified
Jurisdictions, including those specified in _Section_ __ _ 1.01(k)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, and (y) to cause the conditions to the Closing
specified in _Article IX_ to be satisfied. In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to file, or
cause to be filed, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement all notification and report forms or applications that may be
required under Review Laws in the Specified Jurisdictions, including the
Remedy, with respect to the Acquisition. In addition, no party hereto shall
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to delay, hinder or otherwise obstruct the consummation of the
Closing, including any action that delays the obtaining of, or results in not
obtaining, any approval, authorization, consent, clearance, order, license,
permit, qualification, exemption or waiver from any Governmental Authority or
other Person required to be obtained prior to the Closing (it being understood
that this sentence shall not be deemed to expand the obligations or modify the
rights of Seller pursuant to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Purchaser and
Seller shall equally bear all the costs, expenses and fees incurred or payable
to any other Person in connection with obtaining such approvals,
authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications,
exemptions or waivers, including filing fees under any applicable Review Laws
(including the cost and expense of any consultants or other non-legal outside
advisors the parties have retained in connection with any review by a
Governmental Authority related to a Review Law), and (ii) all obligations of
Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing or any other financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __
_ 6.12_ __ and not this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, with regard to the Specified Jurisdictions,
Purchaser shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions, and to do, or
cause to be done to obtain any requisite approvals, authorizations, consents,
clearances, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions or waivers
by Governmental Authority relating to Review Laws in the Specified
Jurisdictions as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such requisite
approvals, authorizations, consents, clearances, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers within three (3) months as of the date
on which approval of the European Commission referred to in _Section_ __ _
9.01(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02(c)_ is obtained. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 6.04(a)_ __ shall be construed to imply that Seller or any of its
Affiliates has any obligation to pay or deliver anything of value, to secure
any third party consents (except for Sellers obligation to share costs
payable under applicable Review Laws as set out above). For greater
certainty, if required to obtain such approvals or clearances under any
applicable Review Laws in the Specified Jurisdictions, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall accept or agree to any actions (including agreeing to
any conditions, undertakings or divestments), or commence litigation, to
secure any approvals or clearances under any applicable Review Laws and to
secure those antitrust clearances in so-called Phase I under Article 6(1)(b)
of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 139/2004 with respect to the European
Commission clearance, or their so-called Phase I national equivalent in the
event of rejection of the request for referral and clearances have to be
obtained from Governmental Authorities in those individual countries listed in
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the Purchaser to divest its
own assets held as of the Effective Date but Purchaser shall be required to
accept conditions and undertakings associated with its or its Affiliates
business. If the European Commission requests any modifications to this
Agreement as

 



69

    

 necessary to approve the Acquisition of the Business pursuant to this
Agreement and/or to approve the Purchaser as a suitable purchaser in
connection with the Remedy, the Purchaser and its Affiliates and Seller shall
make all necessary modifications on a timely basis, and shall do so acting
reasonably and in good faith. Both parties shall also fully cooperate and
timely provide any requested information to the Monitoring Trustee and/or the
European Commission, at every stage of the approval process, in order to
obtain in a timely manner the approval of the European Commission of the
Acquisition of the Business pursuant to this Agreement and the Purchaser as a
suitable purchaser in connection with the Remedy.

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(c) Neither of the parties hereto shall voluntarily extend any waiting period
under any applicable Review Law or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the Acquisition except
with the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, keep
Purchaser reasonably informed about any negotiations Seller, any of its
Affiliates, or any of their respective Representative has with any Labor
Organization, such as works councils and unions regarding the implementation
of the Pre-Closing Restructuring. Seller and its Affiliates, with respect of
the Business, and may not enter into any agreement with a Labor Organization
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

(e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals,
authorizations, consents, clearances, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers of each applicable
Governmental Authority, including:

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings under any
applicable Review Laws , any foreign investments Laws or any other Laws;

(ii) subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_, furnishing
to the other party all information within its possession that is reasonably
required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to any applicable Review Laws, any foreign investment Laws or any
other Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iv) not agreeing to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under applicable Laws unless it consults with
the other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority but subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 6.04(e)_, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat, in each case, to the extent permitted by Law; and

 



70

    

(v) subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_, consulting
and cooperating with one another in connection with all analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, submissions, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings and Actions under or relating to any applicable Review Laws,
any foreign investment Laws or any other Laws in connection with the
Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, Seller shall make the final determination as
to the appropriate course of action with respect to the matters required for
Seller to comply with its obligations under the Remedy.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller
to disclose to Purchaser any nonpublic information about itself, any of
its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates respective businesses or
operations other than information relating to the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Transferred Entities and the Overhead and Shared Services.

 

(f) Purchaser shall initiate or vigorously defend on the merits any Action in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would reasonably be
expected to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Acquisition.

 

Section 6.05 _Bulk_ _Sales_. Where permitted under applicable Law, Purchaser
hereby waives compliance by Seller and its Subsidiaries with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws in connection with the sale of the Business to
Purchaser and its Affiliates. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates against any and all claims that may be asserted
by third Persons against Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of
noncompliance by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with any such bulk transfer
Law.

 

Section 6.06 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_, (i) Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Transferred Entities after the
Closing not to, assert, by way of claim, action, litigation or otherwise, any
right to any Seller Policies or any benefit under any such Seller Policies,
and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities)
shall retain after the Closing all right, title and interest in and to Seller
Policies, including the right to any credit or return premiums due, paid or
payable in connection with the termination thereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all claims and proceeds
actually paid out to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under occurrence based
Seller Policies or under directors and officers and fiduciary liability
policies that are Seller Policies (in all cases, other than actual or de facto
self-insurance arrangements) after the Closing shall be for the benefit of
Purchaser (and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser in the pursuit of such recoveries) to the extent
such claims and proceeds are in respect of (1) the Assumed Liabilities or (2)
the Business or the Transferred Assets, and Seller shall cause such proceeds,
net of any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by
Seller or its Affiliates in obtaining the proceeds, to be transferred to
Purchaser promptly after such proceeds are received by Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such proceeds shall be for the benefit of, and shall be kept
by, Seller to the extent such proceeds are reimbursements (x) for
expenditures that have been made prior to the Closing by Seller or (y) to the
extent relating to insurance coverage for Retained Liabilities. After the
Closing, Purchaser may pursue insurance coverage under an occurrence-based
Seller Policy or under directors and officers and fiduciary liability
policies that are Seller Policies (other than any actual or de facto self-
insurance 

 



71

    

 arrangement) in respect of (1) the Assumed Liabilities or (2) the Business,
the Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets, and Purchaser may control
the pursuit of any such insurance claim. If Purchaser informs Seller in a
timely manner of such claim, then Seller shall report and pursue such claim in
a manner that is at least as favorable to the claimant as the manner in which
Seller reports and pursues claims by itself or its then-existing
Subsidiaries. To the extent Purchaser and/or its Affiliates are insured
Persons under the Seller Policies, Purchaser shall have the right to control
the pursuit of any such insurance claim, and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers pursuit of
insurance coverage under the Seller Policies. Sellers duty to cooperate is
conditioned upon Purchasers payment of any reasonable out-of-pocket
incidental costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with Purchasers pursuit of insurance claims under the Seller
Policies, including the necessary and reasonable costs and expenses of
Sellers consultants, brokers and outside counsel (collectively, " _Outside
Consultants_ "). If Purchasers pursuit of insurance coverage necessitates the
use of any Outside Consultant by Seller or its Affiliates, Seller will
promptly advise Purchaser and provide Purchaser with an opportunity to
evaluate and provide its views on the retention and reasonable costs of such
Outside Consultant. For any insurance claims or proceeds Purchaser is
entitled to under this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, Purchaser shall be liable for
and shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all related insurance
charges, including any deductibles, allocated and unallocated claim expenses,
and any adjustments that result in the recoupment of insurance proceeds paid
by the insurer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __
_ 6.06(b)_, Purchaser shall bear all risk related to the unavailability of
insurance coverage, and Seller shall have no liability, including to Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, for the inability to obtain insurance coverage for
the benefit of Purchaser.

 

(c) With respect to insurance coverage written on a claims made basis (other
than directors and officers and fiduciary liability policies), Seller and
its Affiliates shall have no Liability to Purchaser and its Affiliates or the
Business under such insurance coverage in connection with claims made after
the Closing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _
11.03(a)_, Purchaser shall not be obligated to seek recovery or make any claim
under any such insurance coverage. To the extent such coverage has not already
been procured by Spectrum or its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the
Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement, from and after the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities)
to, cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director or
officer of the Business (an " _Employee Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in
(A) the organizational documents of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Transferred Entities), or (B) agreements between an Employee Indemnified
Party and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Entities), in each case in effect at the Closing Date, to survive the Closing
and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
(6) years after January 2, 2019, or, if longer, for such period as is set
forth in any applicable agreement with an Employee Indemnified Party in effect
on the date of this Agreement. To the extent such coverage has not already
been procured by Spectrum or its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the
Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, maintain in effect the Seller Policies providing directors
and officers and fiduciary liability coverage for the Transferred Entities
for the remaining term of such policies and for six (6) years from January
2019 shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, enter into any renewal
or replacement thereof that would have the effect of excluding the Employee
Indemnified Parties from coverage thereunder. Purchaser shall cause all
Transferred Entities to cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any Employee Indemnified
Party as provided in (A) the organizational documents of the Transferred
Entities, or (B) agreements between an Employee Indemnified Party and any
Transferred Entities, in each case in effect at the Closing Date, to survive
the Closing and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six (6) years after January 2, 2019, or, if longer, for such period as is
set forth in any applicable agreement with an Employee Indemnified Party in
effect on the date of this Agreement. The indemnification obligations of the
Transferred Entities shall be primary to any indemnification obligations of
Seller or its Affiliates as it relates to losses suffered by any Employee
Indemnified Party.

Section 6.07 _Certain_ _Services and Benefits Provided by
Affiliates; Intercompany Matters; Further Assurances_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives Overhead and
Shared Services from other business units of Seller and its Subsidiaries and
from Spectrum and its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement. Purchaser further acknowledges that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, all such Overhead and Shared
Services shall cease, and any agreement with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
in respect thereof shall terminate, as of the Closing Date. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement, following
the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall in good faith determine a
mutually acceptable subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement
under which the Transferred Entities would, in compliance with Law, obtain
the benefits under, and, to the extent first arising after the Closing,
assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with, the
portion of any Shared Contract that is an Excluded Contract relating primarily
to the Business ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such Shared Contract has been
concluded at arms length), and Seller would, in compliance with Law, obtain
the benefits under, and, to the extent first arising after the Closing, assume
the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with, the portion of
any Shared Contract that is a Transferred Contract not relating primarily to
the Business. Each party shall, upon the reasonable written request from the
other party, use reasonable efforts to enforce for the benefit of the other
party (at such other partys sole cost and expense) all rights against any
third party under such Shared Contract to the extent such rights arise under
the portion of the Shared Contract relating to the other partys business,
and, as applicable, promptly pay to the other party when received all monies
received by them under such Shared Contract. Each of Purchaser and Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its Affiliates against
any and all Losses incurred, suffered or sustained by such party or its
Affiliates or asserted against such party or its Affiliates as a result of any
action taken by such first party or any of its Affiliates under or with
respect to any Shared Contract that such first party or any of its Affiliates
obtains the benefits under pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_.

 

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, Purchaser and Seller agree and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser, its Affiliates, to
agree (and Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities to agree) that, from
and after the Closing, all rights and obligations of any party under all
Contracts between Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Entities), on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities, on the other hand,
other than intercompany trade account receivables and trade account payables
between such entities, shall terminate and be cancelled without any further
Liability, including Liability relating to any period prior to the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause any Indebtedness (other than trade account receivables and trade
account payables) owing from any of the Transferred Entities to Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) to be discharged or
released without any Liability to Purchaser or any Transferred Entity. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be not be required to terminate any
intercompany Contracts (including any such Contracts with respect to
Indebtedness) to which the only parties thereto are Transferred Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



73

    

(c) Each of the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
(including, in the case of Purchaser from and after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities) to execute and deliver such documents and other papers
and take such further actions as may reasonably be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the execution and
delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may be necessary to
transfer any Transferred Assets or Varta Companies Equity Interests as
provided in this Agreement and any items identified as a closing deliverable
in any Foreign Acquisition Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
parties shall prepare, execute and deliver whatever reasonable
supplemental agreements, instruments or other documentation is necessary to
consummate the transfer of the Varta Companies Equity Interests in accordance
with the applicable Laws of the jurisdictions under which the Transferred
Entities are organized and on and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; _provided_ __ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
such agreements, instruments and documentation, nothing in such agreements,
instruments and documentation shall supersede or otherwise amend or modify
the rights and obligations provided for in this Agreement and, in the event of
any conflict or alleged conflict between such agreements, instruments and
documentation, on the one hand, and this Agreement, on the other hand, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Article XI_ ) shall
prevail. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing (i) Seller
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law as reasonably requested by Purchaser (A) to
put Purchaser (and/or, at Purchasers election, the Transferred Entities) in
actual possession, ownership and control of the Transferred Assets and
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (B) to assure that
Seller and its Subsidiaries, rather than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
are the obligors in respect of all Retained Liabilities and (ii) Purchaser
shall do all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Law as
reasonably requested by Seller (A) (at Sellers expense) to transfer to Seller
(or such other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets that
Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or any of their respective Affiliates may
possess, (B) to assure that the Transferred Entities, rather than Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, are the obligor in respect of all Assumed
Liabilities, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser for such purposes and
(C) except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)_ __ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.08_, to cease the use or deployment by the Business of those
names and Trademarks that do not constitute Transferred Assets, including
those Trademarks previously used in the Business and set forth in _Section
6.07(c)(ii)(C)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (" _Retained Trademarks_ ").
Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, and at no cost to Seller (other
than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses), make the Business Employees
available at reasonable times and cooperate in all reasonable respects with
Seller and its Subsidiaries in the preparation for, and defense of, any
lawsuit, arbitration or other Action (whether disclosed or not disclosed in
the Seller Disclosure Letter) filed or claimed against Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any of the respective agents, directors, officers and employees
of Seller and its Affiliates, whether currently pending or asserted in the
future, concerning the operation or conduct of the Business prior to
the Closing Date (including in each case by making Business Employees
available at reasonable times to provide information and discovery
documentation, take depositions and testify). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, to the extent that Seller has been granted such rights by
Spectrum pursuant to the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement, Purchaser
shall (i) for a period of two (2) years after January 2, 2019 or such longer
period of time as expressly permitted pursuant to the Spectrum Battery
Acquisition Agreement (the " _Sell-Through Period_ "), (x) have the right to
use (free of charge) on the following items to the extent owned by the
Business any signs, billboards, advertisements, vehicle and equipment
markings, stationary, letterhead, sales literature, invoices, purchase orders,
forms, business cards and other media, including respective online material,
bearing or incorporating any the Retained Trademarks which are identified on 
_Section 6.07(c)(ii)(C)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter as being owned by
Spectrum or its Affiliates (the " _Spectrum Retained Trademarks_ _"_ _)_ , and
(y) have the right to use (free of charge) on the following items to

 



74

    

 the extent owned by the Business any containers, displays, product tags,
labels, packaging or other similar materials bearing or incorporating the
Spectrum Retained Trademarks, in each case of (x) and (y), whether such
materials exist at Closing or are created within the Sell-Through Period,
until the exhaustion of such materials and (ii) within a period of thirty (30)
days after the last Local Agency Agreement terminates, change all corporate
names incorporating any of the Spectrum Retained Trademarks; and, for the
avoidance of doubt, at the end of the foregoing time-periods, Purchaser and
its Affiliate shall cease the sale, distribution or use of any such
products, materials or names bearing or incorporating any of the Spectrum
Retained Trademarks (except as expressly permitted under this Agreement). For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for so long as any Local Agency
Agreement (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) to which both the
Purchaser or its Affiliates and Spectrum or its Affiliates are a party is in
effect, nothing shall prohibit Seller, Purchaser, or any of their respective
Affiliates from complying with the terms thereof and such compliance shall be
deemed not to be a breach of any provision of this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing sentence, the time periods set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)_ shall be deemed to be automatically extended
as necessary to permit continued operations pursuant to the Local Agency
Agreements (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement).

otherwise exploit, solely in connection with the Business, any product, work

such Acquired Intellectual Property in confidence pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.08(b)_, provided, however, that the terms of the Varta Trademark License
Agreement shall exclusively apply to any Acquired Intellectual Property which

confidential information to any other Person other than pursuant to reasonable
confidentiality terms.

 

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller may sublicense their respective rights

party (i) in connection with any merger, public offering, consolidation,
reorganization, or sale of substantially all of the assets or any divisions,
businesses, operating units or portion of such Party, respectively, or (ii) to
such partys Affiliates.

(e) For the period commencing upon the Closing Date and ending upon the date
that is thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date, in the event that

Closing, each of the parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the fifth
(5 _th_ ) anniversary of the Closing Date or such longer time as may be

its Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses);
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall require either party to

if doing so would (i) reasonably be likely to jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or other legal privilege, or (ii) contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including any confidentiality agreement
to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party) (it being understood that
Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers
that would enable otherwise required disclosure to Purchaser to occur without

records may be sought under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ __ for any reasonable
purpose in connection with any matter relating to or affected by the
operations or tax reporting of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries,

records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may be
destroyed by a party if such destroying party sends to the other party hereto
written notice of its intent to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable
detail the contents of the records to be destroyed; such records may then
be destroyed after the sixtieth (60th) day following such notice unless the
other party hereto notifies the destroying party that such other party desires
to obtain possession of such records, in which event the destroying party
shall, prior to destroying such records, give the requesting party a
reasonable opportunity, at the requesting partys expense, to segregate and
transfer the records. In addition, following the Closing, each party agrees
to provide and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to provide, such cooperation and assistance to the other
party, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, such partys auditors), as may be reasonably
requested by such other party upon reasonable advance written notice, in
connection with the audit, accounting, financial reporting, tax, litigation,
federal, foreign or state securities disclosure or other similar needs of
such requesting party; _provided_ that such cooperation and assistance shall
be provided at the requesting partys expense.

 

Section 6.11 _Cooperation_. To the extent that Seller or its Affiliates are

Purchaser, its Affiliates or their Representatives then has such
information in their possession or control or is able to provide such access,
then upon written request by Seller, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide such information or access to Seller, Spectrum and/or
their respective Affiliates. In addition, to the extent that such obligations
relate to the Business, including the Transferred Entities, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions as may be reasonably
requested in writing by Seller and to otherwise reasonably cooperate with
Seller and its Affiliates efforts to comply with Sellers and its Affiliates
obligations under the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement. To the extent
that Seller or its Affiliates are entitled pursuant to the terms of the
Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement or agreements entered into pursuant
thereto to receive from Spectrum or its Affiliates any information or access

its Affiliates, the Transferred Entities or their Representatives, then upon
written request by Purchaser, at the cost of Purchaser, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, request from Spectrum or its Affiliates such
information or access for the benefit of Purchaser.

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing
Commitment, without the prior written consent of Seller, if such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement (i) (A) reduces the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount) to an amount that is below an amount that, assuming
the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ __ and _Article IV_ , is sufficient to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay all fees and amounts
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, or (C) otherwise expand, amend or modify any provision of the Debt
Financing Commitment, in the case of this _clause_ __ _ (C)_, in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay in any material respect or
prevent the Closing, (II) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce
its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto or (III) delay or impair the availability of the Debt
Financing at the Closing or impede the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing (clauses (A), (B) and (C),
collectively, the " _Restricted Financing Commitment Amendments_ ") (
_provided_ __ that, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 6.12_, Purchaser may amend the Debt Financing Commitment (1) to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, but
only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the
aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a Restricted Financing
Commitment Amendment, or (2) in connection with an alternative financing as
contemplated by _clause_ __ _ (b)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_) or (ii)
results in the early termination of the Debt Financing Commitment.

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Debt Financing Commitment (including by complying with so-called "flex"
provisions) until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing as set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment (other than those that are solely within the control
of Seller and its Subsidiaries) and comply with all of its material
obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements (which with respect to any bridge facility documentation shall not
be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the
Debt Financing) with respect to such Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment (and provide executed copies of such definitive
agreements to Seller) or on other terms in the aggregate materially no less
favorable to Purchaser or the interests of Seller, as to conditionality, than
the terms and conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment, as applicable
(provided that in no event shall any such definitive agreement contain terms
(other than those included in the Debt Financing Commitment) that would
constitute Restricted Financing Commitment Amendments), (iv) fully pay any and
all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitment,
and (v) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing and
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources for such portion on terms
and conditions (x) not materially less favorable to Purchaser than the Debt
Financing Commitment, (y) with conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing
not materially less favorable to the interests of Seller than those included
in the Debt Financing Commitment, and (z) in an amount sufficient to
consummate the

 



79

    

 transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Estimated
Purchase Price, the amount to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and
all related fees and expenses promptly following the occurrence of such
event, and in any event prior to or on the Closing Date, and, if obtained,
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller true and complete copies of a new
financing commitment pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide Purchaser with any portion of the Debt Financing.
Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed and in reasonable detail with
respect to all material developments concerning the Debt Financing, including
advising and updating Seller, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to
status and proposed closing date of the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing
of (1) any breach or default by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment of
which Purchaser has become aware, which breach or default if not cured could
reasonably be expected to result in the unavailability of the Debt Financing
or any termination of any of the Debt Financing Commitment, (2) of the
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees,
agents or representatives of any notice or other communication from any Person
with respect to any (I) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreement related thereto or (II) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreement related thereto, in each case which could reasonably be expected to
result in the unavailability of the Debt Financing or any termination of any
of the Debt Financing Commitment, and (3) if for any reason Purchaser
believes in good faith that (A) there is (or there is reasonably likely to be)
a material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related thereto which could
reasonably be expected to result in the unavailability of the Debt Financing
or any termination of any of the Debt Financing Commitment or (B) there is a
material possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements related thereto. References in this
Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ to be
amended, modified or replaced (including, replacement with alternative
financing and alternative financing commitments pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.12_) and references to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such
documents as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ to be amended, modified
or replaced (including replacement with alternative financing commitments
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_), in each case from and after such
amendment, modification or replacement.

 

(c) Unless otherwise provided below, prior to the Closing, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall provide to Purchaser, and shall use their reasonable
commercial efforts to cause their Representatives to (i) obtain, customary
payoff letters, Lien terminations and instruments of discharge necessary to be
delivered at the Closing to allow for the payoff, discharge or termination in
full on the Closing Date of any debt necessary to evidence the release of
liens or guarantees, (ii) take all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Purchaser that are
necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and
(iii) provide all documentation and other information about the Business and
the Transferred Entities to the extent required by applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, in each case, to
the extent reasonably requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not be required to
authorize, execute, deliver or perform under any agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing that (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of
Seller or its Subsidiaries; (B) causes any covenant, representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached in a manner that would cause any
closing condition to Purchasers obligations to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise causes the breach of this 

 



80

    

 Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing); (C) requires Seller or its Subsidiaries to incur
any liability (including, without limitation, any commitment fees and expense
reimbursement) in connection with the Debt Financing, other than solely in the
case of the Transferred Entities, any liability that is contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective only on and after the
Closing; (D) requires Seller or its Subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers, managers or employees to execute, deliver or enter into,
or perform any agreement, document, certificate or instrument with respect to
the Debt Financing or adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents,
instruments and other actions pursuant to which the Debt Financing is
obtained; (E) requires Seller or its Subsidiaries to give any legal opinion or
other opinion of counsel; or (F) requires Seller or its Subsidiaries to take
any action that is prohibited or restricted by, or will conflict with or
violate, its organizational documents. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fees or
make any other out-of-pocket payment or incur any other liability or
obligation or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with
the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing in connection with the Debt
Financing in connection with assisting Purchaser in arranging the Debt
Financing or as a result of any information provided by Seller, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing. Seller, on behalf of the Business, hereby
consents to the use of the Business logos in connection with the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment; _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries.
Purchaser agrees that any information regarding Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates contained in any presentations, offering documents,
teasers or other materials in connection with, or related to, the Debt
Financing shall be subject to the prior review of Seller, which review shall
be completed promptly after receipt thereof.

(d) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, their
respective Subsidiaries and the Representatives of each of the foregoing (the
" _Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments, fines, interest, and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing (including any replacement or alternative financing) and
the performance of their respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.12_ __ or any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
directly arising from a material misstatement in, or material omission in, the
information, taken as a whole, provided by or on behalf of Seller,
specifically for use in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing), in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives.
Purchaser shall, promptly from time to time, and any in any case, within
three (3) Business Days of written request therefor, advance or reimburse (as
requested in writing) Seller and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including external legal costs
and expenses and costs and expenses of their respective Representatives) that
have been incurred by Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Subsidiaries (including those of their respective Representatives) in
connection with cooperation under _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ and/or in the
preparation or cooperation with respect to the preparation of the financial
statements for use by the Purchaser in any of its public filings, including
the notes thereto, or any audit or review of such financial statements by
independent accountants. This  _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, and any termination of this
Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Financing
Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, estates, personal
Representatives, successors and assigns who are each third party beneficiaries
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_.

 



81

    

Section 6.13 _Certain Covenants_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending two (2) years
following the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly contact, solicit or assist in the solicitation of, employ or
retain any individual who is on the Closing Date an employee of the Business
or an employee of Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, unless such
individual is (A) no longer in the employ of the Business or Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, or (B) contacted or solicited through general non-
targeted solicitation or advertisement in a newspaper, online or through an
employment agency.

(b) Seller shall, at the request of Purchaser, enforce its respective rights
against Spectrum under Section 6.13(b) of the Spectrum Battery Acquisition
Agreement in relation to the employees of the Business provided Purchaser
first agrees in writing to pay all out-of-pocket reasonable costs incurred by
Seller in connection therewith.

 

(c) Each of Seller and Purchaser has carefully read this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_
and considered the restraints imposed upon it and its Subsidiaries and
Controlled Affiliates and is in full accord as to the necessity of such
restrictive covenants for the reasonable and proper protection of Purchaser,
its Affiliates and the Business, or Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable,
and agrees that each commitment and restraint imposed by the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ __ is fair and reasonable with respect to subject
matter, geographic scope and time period. It is expressly understood and
agreed that although Seller and Purchaser consider such covenants to be fair
and reasonable, if a judicial determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the time or any other restriction contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ __ is an invalid or unenforceable restriction against
Seller, Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ __ shall not be rendered void
but shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and to such maximum
extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable.
Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that
any restriction contained in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, and
such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding
shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained
herein, which shall be given full force and effect without regard to such
finding.

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges that it has informed each
of their respective Subsidiaries, Controlled Affiliates and Representatives
of the restrictive covenants contained in this Section 6.13, to the extent
applicable, and has directed each such Person to comply with all of the
provisions of this Section 6.13, to the extent applicable.

(e) Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, or Seller Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them arising out of or in connection with any non-
compliance by any of their respective Subsidiaries and Controlled Affiliates
or Representative with the applicable provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.13_.

 

Section 6.14 _Pre-_ _Closing_ _Restructuring_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_, prior to the consummation of the
Closing Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, engage
in restructuring activities necessary to effect a reorganization of certain
assets, liabilities and legal entities to separate the Business from the
Hearing Aid Battery Business and any other business or assets of Seller
or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_"), which
such Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be undertaken in a manner consistent
with  _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as the same may
be modified in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_) and otherwise in a
manner, and pursuant to documentation, reasonably approved 

 



82

    

 by Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) in writing and in accordance with applicable Law. Following
the Pre-Closing Restructuring, at the Closing, Purchaser shall (indirectly
through the Transferred Entities) own and assume all the assets, properties,
claims, rights and Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries constituting
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities and neither Purchaser nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) shall (directly or
indirectly) own any Excluded Assets or, as between Seller and Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates, be liable for or have any responsibility with
respect to any Retained Liabilities.

(b) Seller may propose changes to _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_ (including in order to designate
any additional Subsidiaries as a Transferred Entity (whether as a Varta
Company or as a Varta Company Subsidiary) or to remove any Subsidiary from the
universe of Varta Companies or Transferred Entities) at any time prior to the
Closing and Purchaser shall consider any such proposal in good faith and
shall not unreasonably object to, delay or condition its consent to such
proposed changes. Any such agreed changes shall be incorporated into a
revised, amended and restated _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or  _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_, as applicable.

(c) In connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring, Seller shall, and shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to (i) deliver all agreements, instruments,
certificates and all other documents to effect the Pre-Closing Restructuring
to Purchaser (with appropriate redaction for confidential information relating
to Sellers other businesses or third-parties) and (ii) keep Purchaser
reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the Pre-Closing Restructuring and consult with Purchaser on a
regular basis and cooperate in good faith in connection with all of
Purchasers reasonable requests for information related to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring. In the event that, at any time between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the parties agree to amend  _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_
to designate any additional Subsidiaries as a Transferred Entity (whether as a
Varta Company or as a Varta Company Subsidiary) or to remove any Subsidiary
from the universe of Varta Companies or Transferred Entities, Seller shall be
permitted to revise the Seller Disclosure Letter at such time and in
accordance with such agreement to include any additional necessary disclosures
related thereto. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (x) nothing in any agreements or
instruments entered into by Seller or its Affiliates with each other or Third
Parties in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring, express or implied,
is intended to or shall be construed to replace, substitute, modify, expand,
qualify or limit in any way the terms of this Agreement and (y) to the extent
that any provision of any such agreements or instruments conflict or is
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement (whether or not such agreement
or instrument is stated to be subject to the terms of this Agreement), this
Agreement will govern.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt but subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_,
the Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be completed by Seller or its applicable
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

 

(e) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser all
agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents necessary
to evidence the release of all Liens, guarantees or other encumbrances
against the Transferred Entities and Transferred Assets other than the
Permitted Liens and Liens, guarantees or other encumbrances associated with
Assumed Liabilities.

 

Section 6.15 _Notification_ _of Certain Matters_. During the period following
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party upon receiving Knowledge
of (a) any notices, complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Authorities
with respect to the transactions contemplated

 



83

    

 hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, (b) any written notices or other
written communications from any third Persons alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, (c) the institution of any
material Action involving Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries that relates, in each case, to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (d) any material event, development, or
occurrence that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a failure of a
condition precedent set forth in _Article IX_ or that would
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without prejudice to Purchasers rights under _Article XI_ ,
no such notification or failure to make such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties herein or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder or constitute, in
and of itself, a breach giving rise to the failure of a condition to the
Closing set forth in _Article IX_. For clarity, neither any such supplemental
disclosure, nor any failure by Seller to make any such supplement if Seller
has used its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, will be taken into
account for any purpose under _Article IX_ (including for purposes of
determining the existence or occurrence of a breach pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)_ and determining the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting
therefrom) or for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ have been satisfied.

 

Section 6.16 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) During the period following the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its
terms, Seller shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not, and shall direct
its other Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives not,
directly or indirectly, to: (i) encourage, facilitate, initiate, solicit or
make any proposal or offer with respect to or enter into a merger,
acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity
investment or similar transaction involving the Business, or, other than as
expressly permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_, any purchase of all or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Business (each, a " _Proposal_ ")
with any Person other than Purchaser; or (ii) other than informing Persons of
the existence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, or communicating that such
Person is not permitted to engage in such activity at such time, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any information or data concerning the
Business to, or have any discussions with, any Person other than Purchaser
that has made a Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to
the contrary herein, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ shall restrict
Seller from, subject to compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
discussing, negotiating, providing information in connection with, entering
into any agreement providing for, consummating or otherwise taking any action
in connection with a merger, tender offer, sale, business combination
transaction or other similar transaction so long as such transaction would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or make more unlikely to
occur the consummation of the Acquisition; it being agreed that any
transaction described in this sentence or proposal or offer with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Proposal.

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser orally and in writing promptly (but in any
event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Seller, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives of any
Proposal from any Person other than Purchaser. Such notice shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Proposal and copies of any written Proposals
or amendments and supplements thereto. Seller shall keep Purchaser informed,
on a current basis (but in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours),
of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the material terms of any such Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be required to take any action that would violate
any existing confidentiality agreement.

 



84

    

(c) Seller shall, and shall direct its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and each
of their respective Representatives to, immediately terminate all discussions
or negotiations with all Persons other than Purchaser who have made Proposals
that are currently ongoing and shall promptly request the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to (and terminate the
VDR access of) such Person in connection with such Persons consideration of a
possible Proposal.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01 _Employment_ _Obligations_.

 

(a) With respect to each Business Employee, for the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Transition_ _Period_ "),
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to each Business Employee (i) annual
cash bonus opportunities, equity-based compensation and base salary or wage
rates, as applicable, the amount of which is no less favorable in the
aggregate than the aggregate amount provided to such Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits that are no
less beneficial in the aggregate to the benefits provided by Purchaser to
similarly situated employees, without regard, in each case of _clauses_ __ _
(i)_ and _(ii)_ , to defined benefit pension benefits, or post-termination
health and welfare benefits or retention arrangements;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ to
the contrary, such compensation and benefits provided by Purchaser during the
Transition Period shall be of the type and at levels sufficient to comply
with applicable Law or the terms of any Labor Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to
continue the employment or services of any Business Employee for any period
after the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall in particular not be under any
restriction to implement a restructuring of the Business as proposed by the
report by Boston Consulting Group made available in the VDR, or any similar
restructuring plan immediately after the Closing.

(b) With respect to each Business Employee whose employment terminates during
the Transition Period, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those severance or termination
benefits provided under Purchasers severance plan, program, policy or
practice (whether contractual or otherwise) applicable to such Business
Employee on the date of such Business Employees termination; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ to
the contrary, such severance or termination benefits shall be of the type and
at levels sufficient to comply with applicable Law or the terms of any Labor
Contract.

 



85

    

(c) With respect to each Business Employee, effective from and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize for the benefit
of the Business Employees for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting and for purposes of severance pay, vacation and paid time off, benefit
accrual, service with Seller, Spectrum and their Affiliates to the Closing
Date under any such Purchaser Benefit Plan that recognizes service for such
purposes (or as otherwise required by applicable Law or the terms of any Labor
Contract), except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits or
with respect to any benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan
that is not a Business Benefit Plan, and (ii) with respect to Purchaser
Benefit Plans, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing
condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all
employee health and other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Business Employees, except to
the extent that such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting
period would have applied to such individual under the corresponding Business
Benefit Plan.

(d) As of the Closing Date, to the extent not already in the possession of
the Transferred Entities, Seller shall provide to Purchaser and its Affiliates
copies of all employment records in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Entities) for each Business Employee required to
be provided to Purchaser and its Affiliates under applicable Law and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all employment records for any
other Business Employee as reasonably requested by Purchaser, in each case,
the transfer of which is not prohibited by applicable Law or subject to such
Business Employees consent where required. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the employment
of such Business Employee and shall keep such employment records confidential
to the extent required under applicable Law.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Purchaser
and its Affiliates in respect of Purchasers efforts to retain at the Closing
Date the Business Employees and shall take no actions to cause any individual
who would be as of the date of this Agreement a Business Employee to be
transferred to any business or function of Seller or any of its Affiliates
other than the Business. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may, unless
required by law, not communicate about the contemplated transaction directly
with any Employee or Labor Organization until Seller has first been afforded a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed communications.
Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall neither communicate directly with any
Employee nor Labor Organization regarding the terms and conditions of their
employment with Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) nor make or deliver any
formal written communications or oral representations to any Employee
regarding any other compensation or personnel matters relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in either case, until Purchaser
has first been afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such proposed communications.

 

Section 7.02 _Assumption_ _of_ _Labor Contracts_. Purchaser acknowledges that
all Labor Contracts to which any Transferred Entity is party or by which a
Transferred Entity is bound will remain in effect as of and immediately after
the Closing.

 

Section 7.03 _Liability_ _for Employees_. Effective from and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to assume and be
responsible for any and all Liabilities or obligations of Seller or its
Affiliates (i) arising under or with respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plan
(including any Business Benefit Plan), (ii) arising with respect to Employees
or Former Business Employees of the Transferred Entities, whether incurred
prior to, on or after the Closing Date, (iii) arising under or with respect to
any Business Benefit Plan and (iv) that transfer by operation of law. 

 



86

    

Section 7.04 _No Employee Rights_. Nothing in this _Article VII_ , express
or implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Article VII_ , expressed or implied, shall be construed to prevent Purchaser
from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any Purchaser
Benefit Plan or Business Benefit Plan. Nothing in this _Article VII_
expressed or implied, or any other provision of this Agreement shall amend, or
be deemed to amend, or shall restrict the amendment of any Benefit Plan
(including any Purchaser Benefit Plan or Business Benefit Plan), and nothing
in this _Article VII_ , express or implied, or any other provision of this
Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the establishment of, or an
amendment to, any Benefit Plan (including any Purchaser Benefit Plan
or Business Benefit Plan).

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 8.01 _Transfer_ _Taxes_. Transfer Taxes arising from the acquisition
of Transferred Entities by Purchaser or a designated Affiliate of Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, any transactions in connection with or
relating to the Pre-Closing Restructuring) shall be borne one-half by
Purchaser and one-half by Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall
be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and
its Affiliates from and against, all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection
with the Pre-Closing Restructuring and in the event that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
transactions in connection with or relating to the Pre-Closing Restructuring)
are (contrary to the expectations of the parties) not VAT exempt, such
VAT shall be borne by Purchaser. Seller may not waive any applicable VAT
exemption without the prior written consent of Purchaser. Seller shall provide
to Purchaser an invoice which reasonably meets all requirements under
applicable VAT laws and legal practice of the respective Governmental
Authority. The party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such
Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other
party, except that Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns with respect
to Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring
and promptly provide a copy thereof to Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate to timely
prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer
Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

Section 8.02 _Tax_ _Characterization of Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of the other
following the respective Closings (including any payments made under any
indemnity provisions of this Agreement) as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 8.03 _Straddle_ _Periods_

 



87

    

For all purposes of this Agreement:

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, any Taxes of or with
respect to a Transferred Entity or the Transferred Assets for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of the period commencing on the day immediately
following the Closing Date, based on an interim closing of the books, as if
the Closing Date were the end of a Tax period, and each such portion of such
period shall be deemed to be a separate taxable period; _provided_ that,
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(b) In the case of any real property, personal property and similar _ad
valorem_ Taxes or other periodic Taxes that are payable for a taxable period
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period and the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period beginning
immediately after the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period.

 

Section 8.04 _Tax_ _Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) (i) all Tax Returns of the
Transferred Entities or the Business with respect to taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_") and (ii) all
Combined Tax Returns. Pre-Closing Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of the
applicable Transferred Entity, except as otherwise required by applicable Law
and legal practice of the respective Governmental Authority. Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser for its review and reasonable comment no less than
twenty-five (25) days prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into
account applicable extensions) any Pre-Closing Tax Return with respect to a
Transferred Entity (other than a Combined Tax Return) that has a due date
(including applicable extensions) after the Closing Date and Seller shall
consider in good faith any reasonable written comments that Purchaser submits
to Seller no later than seven (7) days following the delivery of such Pre-
Closing Tax Return to Seller. Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be
timely filed) all such Pre-Closing Tax Returns due after the Closing Date
(including applicable extensions) with respect to the Transferred Entities
(other than Combined Tax Returns) and Seller shall timely file (or cause to
be timely filed) all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred
Assets and all Combined Tax Returns. Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid,
which payment shall be satisfied if Seller pays to Purchaser the amount of
Taxes due for a Tax return that Purchaser is responsible for filing hereunder)
all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns to the extent Seller is liable
for such Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.07_. 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Transferred
Entities or with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets with
respect to Straddle Periods other than the Tax Returns covered in _Section_ __
_ 8.04(a) _(collectively, " _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). All such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practices of the applicable Transferred Entity or, in the case of the
Transferred

 



88

    

 Assets, the Business, except as otherwise required by Law or legal practice
of the respective Governmental Authority. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
for its review and reasonable comment no less than twenty-five (25) days
prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into account applicable
extensions), a copy of any such Straddle Period Tax Return proposed to be
filed. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any reasonable written comments
to any such Straddle Period Tax Return that Seller submits to Purchaser no
later than seven (7) days following the delivery of such Straddle Period Tax
Return to Seller. To the extent Seller is responsible pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 11.07 _for any amount of Taxes due with respect to such Straddle Period
Tax Returns, Seller shall pay Purchaser such amount at least five (5) days
before such Tax Return is due. Purchaser shall pay all Taxes due with respect
to such Straddle Period Tax Returns to the extent Purchaser is liable for such
Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.07_.

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any disputes
concerning any item on a Tax Return described in  _Sections_ __ _ 8.04(a)_
or _8.04(b)_. If Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator. The costs,
fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any such
dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be
filed, any such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner that the party
responsible for filing such Tax Return pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.04(a)_ or
_8.04(b)_ deems correct, and such Tax Return shall be amended as necessary to
reflect the final resolution of such dispute.

 

(d) Except as contemplated by this Agreement (including Section 8.06),
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Transferred
Entities) unless required by applicable law shall not, without the consent of
Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (a)
amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) make any Tax election or change any
accounting period or method with retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or that could otherwise be reasonably be expected to increase the Tax
liability of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or (c) take any action to extend the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

Section 8.05 _Tax_ _Refunds_. Any refund or credit of Taxes (including as a
result of any overpayment of Taxes in prior periods (or portions thereof in
the case of a Straddle Period) and including any interest thereon) accruing to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of the Transferred Entities or
as a result of the ownership of the Transferred Assets or the Business (each,
a " _Tax Asset_ ") attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any
such refund or credit resulting from the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items of a Transferred Entity, as the case may be, attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period) shall be for the account of Seller, except to the
extent such Tax Asset was taken into account in the adjustment described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_. Purchaser shall pay and shall cause its Affiliates to
pay, to Seller the amount of the Tax Asset, net of any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax Asset, within seven (7) days
after such Tax Asset is received or after such Tax Asset is allowed or applied
against another Tax liability, as the case may be. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, execute such documents, file such Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns), take reasonable additional actions and
otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for Purchaser and its
Affiliates to perfect their rights in and obtain all Tax Assets for which
Seller is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_. None of Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall surrender forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise
minimize or delay any material Tax Asset to which Seller would be entitled
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.05_. Except as provided in this _Section_
__ _ 8.05_, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities will be entitled to any
refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect of any
federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Transferred Entities or
in respect of the Business received following the Closing Date.

 



89

    

Section 8.06 _Tax Elections and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Except with the consent of Seller, or as provided on _Section_ __ _ 8.06_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no elections shall be made (i) under Section
338(g) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state or
local law) with respect to the acquisition of the Transferred Equity Interests
or (ii) to treat any Transferred Entity that is organized outside the United
States as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner, or as a
partnership (in the case of a Transferred Entity with multiple owners), for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or convert any such Transferred Entity under
applicable law so that it is so treated. Seller shall take all reasonable
steps to cause any such scheduled election or conversion described in
_Section_ __ _ 8.06(a)(ii)_ to be made effective prior to the Closing
Date, including by filing or by causing to be filed, a properly completed
Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any successor form), which, once made,
shall not be terminated or revoked without the written consent of Purchaser.
Seller and the Subsidiary Transferors shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to Purchaser such
documents or forms as are reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
the making of any elections pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.06_.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability
for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting
any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes, including making any and
all joint elections reasonably requested by the other party in connection with
any such Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund. Any information
obtained under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ shall be kept confidential, except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_ or  _Section_ __
_ 9.01(b)_ and (ii) (A) cannot be cured by the Termination Date or (B) if
capable of being cured, such breach or failure shall not have been cured
within the earlier of (I) thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such
breach or failure and Sellers intention to terminate this Agreement if such
breach or failure is not cured) from Seller of such breach or failure and
(II) one (1) Business Day prior to the earlier of the Termination Date and the

and covenants of Seller that require performance from and after the Closing,
survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with

to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)(iii)_ unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Seller, but for

and _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ __ exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount

Deductible);

 

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ for any claim where the
Losses relating thereto are less than Fifty Thousand Euros (50,000) (the "
_De Minimis_ ") (it being understood that any series of related claims shall
be aggregated for purposes of this _clause_ __ _ (b)(iv)_ and the
immediately preceding _clause_ __ _ (b)(iii)_);

 

(v) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ for any amount that when aggregated with all
other amounts payable as a result of indemnification under _Section
11.01(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.01(a)(iii)_ would be in excess of Eighteen
Million Euros (18,000,000) (the " _Cap_ ");

(vi) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_ in
connection with any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.14(c)_, such obligations to indemnify

other amounts paid as a result of indemnification under _Section 11.01(a)_
would be in excess of the Unadjusted Purchase Price;

(viii) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_, all Losses shall be (x)
reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to Purchaser

premiums under such Transferred Policy), (B) any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment actually paid to Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such Loss, and (C) an
amount equal to any net reduction of income Taxes of Purchaser, its Affiliates
or any Purchaser Indemnified Person attributable to a Tax benefit actually
realized in the year of such loss or the immediately succeeding two (2)
taxable years as a direct result of such Loss, determined on a "with and
without" basis;

 



95

    

(ix) The obligations to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(iii)_
with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_ (each, an " _Environmental Claim_ ") shall not apply to
any Losses resulting from or relating to (i) any environmental matter or
condition that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation or
reporting by or on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons that is not
required by Environmental Laws, or (ii) any environmental investigatory,
corrective or remedial action (including any Remedial Action), except to the
extent such action is required by Environmental Laws and is limited to the
lowest cost alternative reasonably available to allow either (A) continued
operation of the Real Property in substantially the same manner it was
operated at the Closing on the basis of the minimum reasonably required to
comply with any settlement or resolution with any Governmental Authority and
Environmental Laws and in a manner that does not materially interfere with
such operations at the Real Property, or (B) closure or termination of
operations at the Real Property in compliance with Environmental Laws (it
being understood that closure or termination of operations does not include
any disturbance of the applicable Real Property except to the extent required
by applicable Law as a result of such closure or termination of operations).
Taking no action shall constitute an acceptable lowest cost alternative if,
after investigation, taking no action is determined to be in compliance with
Environmental Laws and such inaction is not prohibited by relevant
Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to claim or seek
indemnity with respect to any Environmental Claim under this Agreement to the
extent that such Environmental Claim arises out of any development,
modification or change of use of any of the Real Property after the Closing
to a use other than the continued operation of the Business or the
continuation of the activities necessary to support the Business as it was
conducted as of the Closing, where such development, modification or change
results in the application of stricter cleanup standards pursuant to
Environmental Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that closure or termination of
operations at a Real Property shall not constitute such a development,
modification or change in use (it being understood that closure or
termination of operations does not include any disturbance of the applicable
Real Property except to the extent required by applicable Law as a result of
such closure or termination of operations); and

 

(x) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)(iii)_, the Deductible shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_ in
respect of the representation and warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no obligation to indemnify
under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_ in respect of the representation and
warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of
such Losses exceeds an amount equal to Six Hundred and Twenty Five Thousand
Euros (625,000), in which event the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)(iv)_ and _(v)_ ) to make a claim for indemnification
for all Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Person in respect of the
representation and warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_ from the first Euro of
such Losses.

 

(xi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to conduct due diligence and
investigation with respect to the Business, the Transferred Entities, the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities, and confirms that, as of the date
hereof, Purchaser is not aware of any breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant of Seller and agrees that in no event shall the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) have any liability to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) with respect
to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement
or any Foreign Acquisition Agreement to the extent that the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) knew of such breach on or
prior to the Closing Date.

 



96

    

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, members and agents (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them (without duplication for any
indemnification that may be sought under more than one clause of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_) that result from, relate to or arise out of:

 

(i) any breach of any of Purchasers representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement (other than the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) or
such corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (other than
such representations and warranties that refer to a specified date, in which
case as of such date);

(ii) any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations or such
corresponding representations and warranties contained in any certificate
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (other than such
representations and warranties that refer to a specified date, in which case
as of such date);

(iii) any breach of any of Purchasers agreements, obligations or covenants
contained in this Agreement; and

(iv) the operation of the Business from and after the Closing (including any
amount that Seller or its Affiliates are required to pay to Spectrum or its
Affiliates arising from a failure by Purchaser or its Affiliates to perform
their obligations to Spectrum or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement or any agreements entered into or acceded to by Purchaser
or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement) or the
Assumed Liabilities;

 

 _provided_ that all matters relating to Taxes (including Taxes relating to
the Pre-Closing Restructuring) shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __
_ 11.07_.

(d) Purchasers indemnification obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_
__ shall be subject to each of the following limitations:

(i) (A) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_,
such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the date which is eighteen (18) months from the Closing
Date; (B) with respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(ii)_
_,_ such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; and (C) with respect to indemnification under _Section
11.01(c)(iv)_ such obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect in perpetuity;

 

(ii) With respect to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(iii)_,
such obligation to indemnify shall, (A) with respect to the underlying
agreements, obligations and covenants of Purchaser that require performance on
or prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect until the date which is eighteen months from the Closing Date, and
(B) with respect to the underlying agreements, obligations and covenants of
Purchaser that require performance from and after the Closing, shall survive
the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms
of such underlying agreements, obligations and covenants of Purchaser;

 



97

    

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under  _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(i)_ unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Purchaser, but for
this _clause_ __ _ (iii)_, would be liable under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_
exceeds on a cumulative basis the Deductible and then only to the extent of
such excess;

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under  _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)(i)_ for any claim where the Losses relating thereto are less than the
De Minimis (it being understood that any series of related claims shall be
aggregated for purposes of this  _clause_ __ _ (d)(iv) _and the immediately
preceding _clause_ __ _ (d)(iii)_);

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, there shall be no
obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ __ for any amount
that when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of
indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ __ (but for the
application of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(d)(v)_) would be in excess of the
Cap;

 

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, there shall be no
obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(c)(i)-(iii)_ for any amount
that when aggregated with all other amounts paid as a result of
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)-(iii) _would be in excess of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

 

(vii) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, all Losses shall be (x)
reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to Seller
or any Seller Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss, less the costs
associated with recovering such proceeds and any increases in insurance
premiums, (B) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
paid to Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person by any third party with
respect to such Loss, and (C) an amount equal to any net reduction of income
Taxes of Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person attributable to a Tax
benefit actually realized in the year of such loss or the immediately
succeeding two (2) taxable years as a direct result of such Loss, determined
on a "with and without" basis.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.01_, if a claim for indemnification is properly asserted in good faith
pursuant to this _Article XI_ __ prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to such
indemnification claim and the applicable partys indemnification obligations
with respect thereto shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the
final resolution thereof. For purposes of calculating the amount of
any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification
hereunder and for purposes of determining whether or not a breach of any
representation or warranty has occurred, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to any qualifiers or exceptions as to "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect," or other similar qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other
than _Section_ __ _ 4.02(a)_ (Audited Financial Statements), Section __
4.03(d) (No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes or Events),
_Section 4.11(f)_ and the word "Material" in the term "Material Contracts"
and the categories of "Material Contracts" in _Section_ __ _ 4.12_) shall be
disregarded both for purposes of (i) determining the existence or occurrence
of a breach pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ __ or _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)_ __ and (ii) determining the amount of Losses arising out of or
resulting therefrom.

 



98

    

Section 11.02 _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

 

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens or
asserts any action that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under this _Article
XI_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have a claim to be
indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim
(a " _Direct Claim_ "), then, in case of _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ ,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly and any event within twenty (20) days
after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim or
the Indemnified Party first becoming aware of the underlying facts or
circumstances that are reasonably expected to give rise to a Third Party
Claim or Direct Claim send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
specifying (to the extent known) in reasonable details the nature, facts and
circumstances of such claim and the amount of all related Losses (a " _Claim
Notice_ "), provided, however, that any failure to give such Claim Notice or
to provide such facts and amounts shall not affect the rights of the
Indemnified Parties, except to the extent that such failure actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party (and such actual prejudice shall in
particular exist if the Seller loses an opportunity to seek recourse against
Spectrum under the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement because of the
failure by the Purchaser to give such Claim Notice or to provide such facts
and amounts).

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to control the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Parties a
reasonable opportunity to participate, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of
such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider
recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (A) such Third-Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, (B) such
Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party (other than in cases where the primary remedy being sought
by such third party or Governmental Authority is monetary damages), (C)
except where Seller is the Indemnifying Party and is required under the terms
of the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement to permit Spectrum to control
the defense of such Third-Party Claim in order for Seller to seek
indemnification from Spectrum in connection with such Third-Party Claim, such
Third-Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to result in Losses
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of this clause (C),
any Tax excess) in excess of the maximum amount for which the Indemnifying
Party is potentially liable with respect to such Third Party Claim, (D) the
Indemnified Partys counsel advises that a conflict of interest exists or
would reasonably be expected to arise in the event the Indemnifying Party
elects to control or defend any Third-Party Claim, (E) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith such Third-Party Claim, (F)
such Third-Party Claim arises out of any Release of any Hazardous Material or
noncompliance with any Environmental Law at any Real Property or (G) such
Third-Party Claim arises out of or relates to any Intellectual Property
constituting a Transferred Asset. If, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnifying Partys outside counsel, the equitable relief or other relief
portion of the Third-Party Claim referenced in _clause (B) _above can be
separated from the claim for money damages without prejudicial effect (other
than a _de minimis_ prejudicial effect) on the non-monetary claims, then, with
the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the

 



99

    

 Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion of
such claim relating to money damages. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to settle, compromise or discharge a Third-Party Claim either (I) with
the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (II) without any
Indemnified Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (x)
provides for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages and such
monetary damages are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, (y) includes as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such
Third-Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from
all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and (z) does not contain
an admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment which
would impose any injunctive or equitable relief on the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Indemnified Parties and
assume control of such defense within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of
written notice of such Third Party Claim or if both the Indemnifying Party and
any Indemnified Party are parties to or subjects of such Action and conflicts
of interests exist between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Action and assume control of the
defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action, and the
fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such counsel per
jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
controls the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.02(c)_. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any
liability in connection with any settlement of any Third-Party Claim that is
entered into without its prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that Purchaser
seeks indemnification from Seller under this _Article XI_ in respect of any
matter which Seller may be entitled to seek full or partial indemnification
from Spectrum pursuant to the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement, then,
without limiting Purchasers obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, at the
request of Seller, Purchaser shall take such actions and provide such
cooperation and assistance to Spectrum to the same extent that Seller is
required to do as a condition of seeking indemnification of Spectrum pursuant
to Article XI of the Spectrum Battery Acquisition Agreement.

 

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no
cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall take reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize
any privilege reasonably available to an Indemnified Party in respect of any
of its records.

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, within thirty (30) days of delivery of a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.10_.

 



100

    

Section 11.03 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery (i) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one (and for purposes of
clarity there shall be no liability for a breach of any covenant where the
primary purpose of such covenant is to maintain the truth or correctness of
any representation or warranty or of notifying a party about any untruth or
incorrectness of any representation or warranty other than what is available
for the breach of such underlying representation or warranty) or (ii) to the
extent such liability was already deducted from the Unadjusted Purchase Price
in accordance with Section 2.03 or was already taken into account under
_Section 2.04_ or otherwise taken into account in determining the Purchase
Price. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not have any liability for a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement if in relation to
the same circumstances, state or facts giving rise to such liability, an
amount has been deducted from the Unadjusted Purchase Price. In respect of
the Pension Plan Purchase Price Adjustment, RandD Alkaline Capex Purchase Price
Adjustment, amounts reimbursed in respect of RandD Sourcing Capex or other
matters pursuant to Section 2.04(g), and Stranded Costs Purchase Price
Adjustments, the amount of this deduction represents the full amount of the
compensation for any Liabilities relation to the Transferred Pension Plans,
RandD Alkaline Capex, RandD Sourcing Capex or other matters to be reimbursed
pursuant to Section 2.04(g), and Stranded Costs and no further amount shall be
recoverable from Seller with regard thereto in any way whatsoever,
irrespective of whether the actual any liabilities relation to the
Transferred Pension Plans, RandD Alkaline Capex, RandD Sourcing Capex or other

for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) any Taxes for which a Transferred
Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser is liable as a transferee or
successor or by Contract (other than Contracts that do not primarily relate
to Taxes),, in each case, to the extent such Taxes are attributable to the
operation of the Business or ownership of the Transferred Assets prior to the

inaccuracy in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii)
any Taxes taken into account in the adjustment described in _Section_ __ _

102

    

(i) Promptly after a party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware
of the existence of a Tax Proceeding that may give rise to an indemnification
claim under this _Section 11.07_ (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") by it against the
other party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), the Tax Indemnified Party
shall notify the Tax Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall
promptly forward to the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of the relevant portion
of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority
and communications with any Tax Authority relating to such Tax Controversy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not affect
such other partys rights to indemnification under this _Article XI_ , except
to the extent that such party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(ii) After the Closing Date, Seller (or its designates) shallif they
so electcontrol the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any Tax
Controversy with respect to any of the Transferred Entities or the Transferred
Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent such Tax
Controversy could reasonably be expected to result in any indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.07(a)_, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except in the case of a Tax Controversy with respect to a Combined Tax
Return, (A) Purchaser and/or the Transferred Entities shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Controversy at their own expense, (B) Seller shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Controversy that is
reasonably expired to result in material adverse tax consequences the
Purchaser without obtaining Purchasers written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (C) Seller shall
keep Purchaser reasonably informed as to the progress of any such Tax
Controversy and shall consider in good faith any written comments or
suggestions provided by Purchaser regarding such Tax Controversy.

 

(iii) To the extent that any provision in this _Section_ __ _ 11.07(c)_ may
overlap or conflict with any provision contained in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.07(c)_ shall govern.

(d) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.07_, all Losses in respect of
Taxes shall be reduced by (i) any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment actually paid to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any
third party with respect to such Loss, and (ii) an amount equal to any net
reduction of income Taxes of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person
attributable to a Tax benefit actually realized in the year of such loss or
the immediately succeeding two (2) taxable years as a direct result of such
Loss.

(e) Sellers indemnity obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ __
shall survive until the date that is six (6) months from the date of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitation (including all periods of
extension, whether automatic or permissive), and such indemnity obligations
shall not be subject to any of the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.01(b)_.

(f) In no event shall the Purchaser Indemnified Persons be entitled to
recover, any Loss attributable to Taxes of any of the Transferred Entities (i)
for any taxable period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the
extent such Taxes are attributable to a breach of any representation set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(k)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.15(l)_ or any inaccuracy in 
_Section_ __ _ 4.15(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii) as a result of
any transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business, (iii) as a result of Purchasers financing of
the transactions provided for in this Agreement, (iv) to the extent such Taxes
are not actually paid, or due and payable, to the relevant Governmental
Authority or (v) due to the unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax Period of
any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an

assert, or delay in the assertion of, rights under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 12.02 _Expenses_.

Agreements, the parties shall bear their respective direct and indirect costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any failure of a party to
comply with any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ shall not be
a breach of this Agreement or relieve the other party of its obligations under
this Agreement except and only to the extent the other party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby.

 

Section 12.04 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 12.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
applicable Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
fundamentally changed. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 12.06 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Seller

respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 12.07 _Assignment_. Neither party may transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party;

rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or (ii)
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder,
in each case, if Purchaser nonetheless remains fully responsible for the
performance of their respective obligations hereunder. Any transfer in
violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 12.07_ __ shall be null and void.

 



105

    

Section 12.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or
entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 12.09 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.

Section 12.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any dispute arising out of
or relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto (i)
agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief
whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be brought only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
in and for New Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts have
exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware), and not in any other State or
Federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other
country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
located in for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action
brought in such a court or any claim that any such Action brought in such a
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) agrees that mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ _ _ or any other manner as may
be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

Section 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic means (including portable document format) shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 

Section 12.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation, claim, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, the Acquisition, the Debt Financing or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any such action,
proceeding or counterclaim involving any Financing Sources). Each party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section_ __ _ 12.12_. 

 



106

    

Section 12.13 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary damages alone. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.01_, the parties shall be entitled to obtain an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court as specified in _Section_ __ _ 12.10_, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any the
other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
No Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction.

Section 12.14 _No Presumption_. The parties to this Agreement agree that this
Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that the
final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties negotiations.
Each party represents and warrants that it has sought and received legal
counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties agree that this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them,
and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should not be construed
against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or parties drafted or
was more responsible for drafting the provisions.
