PBCL, including, without limitation, the effects set forth in Section 1929 of
the PBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and  
6    purposes and assume and be liable for all the liabilities,
obligations and penalties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary.   (d) The
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times
Square, New York, NY 10036, at 10:00 a.m. local time, as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) business days, after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing) (the actual time
and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date").  
Section 2.2 Conversion of Shares.   (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:   (i)
each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company  as treasury stock or
held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than  Buyer, UNIC, PIC and
PIC\'s Subsidiaries) immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with  respect thereto; provided, that
shares of Company Common Stock held by the  Company, Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries in trust accounts, managed  accounts, investment accounts and
the like shall not be cancelled and  shall be treated in accordance with
Section 2.2(a)(iv);   (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share,  of Merger Subsidiary ("Merger Subsidiary Common Stock") outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become 
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same  rights,
powers and privileges as the share so converted and the shares so  converted,
together with the shares remaining outstanding pursuant to  Section
2.2(a)(iii), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of  capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation;   (iii) each share of Company Common Stock
held by Buyer, UNIC,  PIC or any of PIC\'s Subsidiaries shall remain
outstanding and shall be  unaffected by the Merger and shall represent shares
of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation; provided, that shares of
Company Common Stock held  by PIC or any of its Subsidiaries in trust
accounts, managed accounts,  investment accounts and the like shall not
remain outstanding and shall be  treated in accordance with Section
2.2(a)(iv); and   (iv) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise  provided
in Sections 2.2(a)(i) and 2.2(a)(iii), be converted into the  right to
receive (A) an amount of Class A common shares, $0.0001 par value  per share,
of Parent ("Parent Class A Common Shares") equal to the  Exchange Ratio (the
"Per Share Stock Amount") and (B) an amount in cash  equal to $1.50 (the "Per
Share Cash   7     Amount"), issuable and payable, without interest,
upon surrender of the  certificate that formerly evidenced such share of
Company Common Stock (a  "Certificate") in the manner provided in Section
2.3. For the purposes of  this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal
to the result obtained  by dividing $13.875 by the Average Sales Price. For
the purposes of this  Agreement, the "Average Sales Price" shall be the
volume weighted average  sales price of a Parent Class A Common Share, as
reported on the Nasdaq  Stock Market by The Wall Street Journal (or in the
absence thereof, by  another authoritative source) during the twenty (20)
consecutive trading  days ending on and including the trading day immediately
preceding the  date of the Effective Time (the "Measurement Period")). For
the purposes  of this Agreement, the "Merger Consideration" means the right
to receive  the Per Share Stock Amount and the Per Share Cash Amount pursuant
to the  Merger with respect to each share of Company Common Stock (together
with  any cash in lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.6
below).   (b) From and after the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) and all shares of
Company Common Stock converted in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(iv) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except, in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(iv), the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled and any dividends
payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f) with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by the Certificate(s) surrendered by such holder
pursuant to Section 2.3(b). From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing Merger Subsidiary Common Stock shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent only the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
Section 2.2(a)(ii).   Section 2.3 Surrender and Payment.   (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint an exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger
Consideration. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Buyer
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i)
certificates representing the Parent Class A Common Shares issuable pursuant
to Section 2.2(a)(iv), (ii) cash sufficient to make the cash payments payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(iv), and (iii) from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares to the extent required by
Section 2.6. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer will send, or cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in such
exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent), which letter shall be in such form as the Company and
Buyer may reasonably agree to use in effecting delivery of shares of Company
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent.   8     (b) Each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided herein will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate only upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
such Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate so converted shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
as part of the Merger Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.6.   (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in or paid to the name of a Person other than the Person in whose
name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration or payment of such Merger Consideration that
(i) the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such registration or
payment of the Merger Consideration shall (A) pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such registration or payment
in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate,
or (B) establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of capital stock of the Company
on the stock records of, or relating to, the Company. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer, they shall be canceled and, if applicable, exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures and limitations set forth, in this Article II.   (e) Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Buyer and any such holder who has not exchanged such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Buyer for
delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
such date on which any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Certificate or any cash payable to the holder
of such Certificate pursuant to this Section 2.3 would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or
such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f) No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Shares shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until such  
9    Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.3. Subject
to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be
paid, without interest, to the record holder of the Parent Class A Common
Shares issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Class A
Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such Parent Class A Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Class A
Common Shares, all Parent Class A Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   (g) The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) as directed by Buyer on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly
be paid to Buyer.   Section 2.4 Stock Options and Other Equity Awards.  
(a) All options to acquire Company Common Stock (the "Company Options")
outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, at the
Effective Time under the Company\'s 1993 Stock Incentive Plan and
the Company\'s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, each as amended (collectively, the
"Company Stock Option Plans"), shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
Company Stock Option Plans. At the Effective Time, all of the Company Options
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed in full by Parent, and, solely
to the extent provided for in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and/or
the related Company Option agreements, shall vest and become fully
exercisable. Parent, Buyer and the Company acknowledge that the Merger
constitutes a "Change of Control" pursuant to each of the Company Stock
Option Plans. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the
Company in the Company Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock option
agreements issued thereunder shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall
have assumed the Company Stock Option Plans as of the Effective Time by
virtue of this Agreement and without any further action by Parent. Each
Company Option assumed by Parent (each, a "Substitute Option") shall be
converted automatically into options to purchase Parent Class A Common Shares
upon the same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to such Company Option, except that (A) each such
Substitute Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right
to acquire, that whole number of Parent Class A Common Shares (rounded to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is 15.375 and the denominator of which is the Average Sales Price
(without reference to the dollar sign) (such fraction, the "Option Exchange
Ratio") and (B) the exercise price per Parent Class A Common Share under each
Substitute Option shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to the related Company Option in  
10    effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by Option
Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded
to the nearest full cent). Except as set forth above, such Substitute Option
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Company
Option. Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined below)
sets forth a list of all Company Options as of the date hereof, including the
name of the holder and date of grant of each such Company Option, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto and the exercise price
thereof.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute
Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant
thereto, and such Substitute Option shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions, subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.4
after giving effect to the Merger. Parent shall comply with the terms of all
such Substitute Options and ensure that the conversion and assumption
provided in this Section 2.4 with respect to any Company Option that
qualifies as an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. The Company has heretofore taken or shall take
all actions with respect to the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company
Options that are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 2.4.
Parent has heretofore taken or shall take all actions with respect to the
Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Options that are necessary
to implement the provisions of this Section 2.4, including, without
limitation, all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Parent Class A Common Shares for delivery upon exercise
of Substitute Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.4. As
soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall file an effective Registration Statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the
Parent Class A Common Shares subject to the Substitute Options and use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses associated therewith) for so long as such
Substitute Options remain outstanding.   (c) On or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company
shall take all reasonable and customary actions requested by the Company to
seek that, with respect to each member of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each employee of the Company (including each such person who will
become a director or officer of Parent) who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act, the acquisition by such person of Parent Class A Common Shares
or Substitute Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the disposition by any such person of Company Common Stock or
Company Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
be exempt from the short-swing profit liability rules of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder. Such requested
actions shall be consistent with all current applicable interpretation and
guidance of the SEC, including, but not limited to, the No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate,  
11    Meagher and Flom LLP. The parties acknowledge that all such above
referenced dispositions and acquisitions are compensatory in nature.  
Section 2.5 Adjustments. If, at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options the same economic effect,
in the aggregate, as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.  
Section 2.6 Fractional Shares.   (a) No fractional Parent Class A Common
Shares shall be issued in connection with the Merger and no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Class A Common Shares shall be payable on
or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights as a shareholder of
Parent.   (b) Buyer shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in
cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Common
Stock an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the fractional share
interest of a Parent Class A Common Share to which such holder otherwise
would be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) multiplied by (B) the
Average Sales Price.   (c) As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock
with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall
promptly request such amount from Parent and promptly upon receipt thereof
pay such amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock.   Section 2.7
Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Buyer and
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article
II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law including any withholding from any payment that is treated as
wages or compensation for the performance of services. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.   Section 2.8 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming the
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by that Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent or   12    the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this Article II.   ARTICLE III   CERTAIN GOVERNANCE MATTERS   Section
3.1 Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The articles of
incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
(until amended in accordance with applicable Law).   Section 3.2 Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation. The bylaws of the Company in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (until amended in accordance with applicable Law).   Section
3.3 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in accordance with the bylaws and applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as expressly disclosed in the most recent Annual Report

Form 10-K (including, in each case, to the extent included in any document
filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit thereto), in each case

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of the Company\'s Subsidiaries and for each such Subsidiary indicates
its ownership and the jurisdictions in which it is organized and qualified to

this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
will govern.   Section 6.5 No Solicitation; Unsolicited Proposals.   (a)
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, from the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company\'s and such Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information), any
inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose or
provide any non-public information or data relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or accept an Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) enter into any Contract (including any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, or understanding) with respect to or contemplating any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct the Company\'s and such Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitation,
initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any Third
Party conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries   49    or
their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request that each
Third Party that has heretofore executed a confidentiality or similar
agreement within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement
in connection with any Third Party\'s consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished
to any Third Party by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section
6.5(a), if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company receives
an unsolicited bona fide written proposal from a Third Party relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has
complied with its obligations under Section 6.5(a)), and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Company Independent Committee conclude in
good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and receiving the advice of nationally recognized
outside counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal is, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (B) the failure to provide
nonpublic information or data concerning the Company or participate in
negotiations or discussions concerning such Acquisition Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law, the Company may,
subject to its giving Parent at least two (2) business days\' prior written
notice of the identity of such Third Party and the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal and the Company\'s intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Third
Party, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such Third Party pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less restrictive than the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that a copy of all such
information is delivered simultaneously to Parent if it has not previously
been so furnished to Parent, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal.   (c) The Company shall as soon as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify and
advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or of any
request for information or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead
to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall
inform Parent on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and material details
of any discussions regarding, or relating to, any Acquisition Proposal with a
Third Party (including amendments and proposed amendments) and, as promptly
as practicable, of any change in the price, structure or form of the
consideration or material terms of and conditions regarding the Acquisition
Proposal.   (d) The Company agrees that it will promptly inform its and
its Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 6.5. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 6.5
by any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any of the Company\'s or the
Company\'s Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives shall be deemed a breach
by the Company of this Section 6.5.   50     (e) Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any such other disclosures that are
required by applicable Law.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement:   (i)
"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, offer,  proposal, indication of
interest, signed agreement or completed action, as  the case may be, by any
Third Party that relates to (1) a transaction or  series of transactions
(including any merger, consolidation,  recapitalization, liquidation or other
direct or indirect business  combination) involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the  issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or
other equity  securities or Voting Debt of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  representing fifteen percent (15%) or more (by voting power) of
the  outstanding capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(2)  any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any 
Person, together with all affiliates thereof, beneficially owning shares  of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries representing fifteen percent (15%) or more (by voting power)  of
the outstanding capital stock of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, or
(3) the acquisition, license, purchase or other  disposition of a material
portion of the business or assets (including the  capital stock or assets of
any Subsidiary) of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries outside the
ordinary course of business or inconsistent with  past practice; and   (ii)
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal
(provided, that for the purposes of this definition,  (A) the applicable
percentages in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of  Acquisition Proposal
shall be a majority as opposed to fifteen percent  (15%), and (B) any
acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition  referred to in clause
(3) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall  be for a majority of the
business and assets (including the capital stock  or assets of any
Subsidiary) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),  on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified,  that the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Company Independent  Committee determine in
their good faith judgment (after receiving the  advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and  nationally recognized outside
counsel), taking into account, among other  things, all legal, financial
(including the effect of any Termination Fee  payable hereunder and any
additional fees and expenses to be incurred in  connection with such
proposal), timing, likelihood of completion (taking  into account all
approvals and consents required from Governmental  Authorities, Third Parties
and shareholders), any financing conditions or  contingencies, and other
aspects of the proposal and the Third Party  making the proposal, would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that  is more favorable to the
Company\'s shareholders (other than Parent, Buyer,  Merger Subsidiary, PIC
and PIC\'s Subsidiaries and their respective  affiliates) (in their
capacities as shareholders), from a financial point  of view, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   51     (g) The Company
agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive
or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill"
or similar agreement to which any of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a
party. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent.   Section 6.6
Board Recommendation.   (a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), none of the Board of
Directors of the Company, the Company Independent Committee nor any committee
or subcommittee of either of the foregoing thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, modify or amend (or propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend)
in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or take any
action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
Company Shareholder Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (it being understood that if an Acquisition Proposal is
received by the Company and Parent requests that the Board of Directors of
the Company and the Company Independent Committee reaffirm the Company
Recommendation, a failure to so reaffirm the Company Recommendation within
three (3) business days of Parent\'s request shall be considered an adverse
modification of the Company Recommendation), or (ii) approve or recommend (or
propose publicly to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (each of
the foregoing being referred to as a "Company Change in Recommendation").  
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.6(a), if, prior to the
Company Shareholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Company Independent Committee determines in good faith (after receiving
the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
nationally recognized outside counsel) that the failure to make a Company
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the Company\'s shareholders under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company
Independent Committee may make a Company Change in Recommendation but, in
each case, only (i) after the Company provides to Parent a written notice (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") (x) advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Company Independent Committee have received,
and desire to accept, a Superior Proposal, (y) specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the amount per share that the
Company\'s shareholders will receive per share of Company Common Stock
(valuing any non-cash consideration at what the Board of Directors of the
Company and the Company Independent Committee determine in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to
be the fair value of the non-cash consideration) and including a copy thereof
with all accompanying documentation, and (z) identifying the Person making
such Superior Proposal, (ii) and after negotiating in good faith with Parent
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation
without a Company Change in Recommendation if and to the extent Parent elects
to seek to make such adjustments; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
obliged to propose or agree to any such adjustment, and (iii) if Parent does
not, within five (5) calendar days of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of
Superior   52    Proposal, make an offer that the Board of Directors of
the Company and the Company Independent Committee determine in good faith
(based on the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be as favorable to the Company\'s shareholders as such
Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
entitled to enter into any agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
as contemplated by Section 6.5(b)) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless
this Agreement has been or concurrently is terminated by its terms pursuant
to Section 8.1 and the Company has paid any amounts due to Parent pursuant to
Section 8.3(b).   Section 6.7 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best
Efforts.   (a) Each of the Company, Merger Subsidiary and Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or
its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain (and
to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) as promptly as reasonably
practicable any permit, consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other public or private
third party which is required to be obtained or made by such party or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly cooperate with and furnish information to the other and, to the
extent practicable, consult with each other on, all the information relating
to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective
affiliates, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority or any other third party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations and orders of
all Governmental Authorities and any other third parties necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of written notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective affiliates from any such third party or Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent
may, as they deem reasonably necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
information provided to the other under this Section 6.7 as "outside counsel
only" and such information shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient. The Company and Parent shall provide the other party with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that (i) such participation of the
Company shall not be required to be permitted by Parent in connection with
meetings not primarily related to obtaining any Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, and (ii) such participation shall not entitle the Company to
direct the conduct of any such meeting or otherwise bind Parent to any
action.   53     (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall
cause to be filed, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to file with all
applicable Governmental Authorities, all filings required to be made under
Laws governing the insurance businesses of Parent and the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Insurance
Filings"). Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide each other with copies of any written comments and
advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Insurance
Filings from each applicable Governmental Authority. Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any Insurance Filing, and on any amendment or
supplement thereto and each will provide the other with a copy of all such
filings made.   (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority or any
other third party under any applicable Law, or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental Authority or any other third party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges as such Governmental
Authority or other third party may have to such transactions as promptly as
practicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby
agree and acknowledge that reasonable best efforts under Section 6.7(a) and
Section 6.7(c) shall not require or be construed to require, and nothing else
in this Agreement shall require or be construed to require, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or other affiliates, to (i)(A) offer, sell or hold separate
pending divesture, or agree to offer, sell or hold separate pending
divestiture, or (B) consent to any such offer, sale, holding or agreement,
before or after the Effective Time, of any businesses, operations or assets,
or interests in any businesses, operations or assets, of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other action or agree or
consent to any limitation or restrictions on or changes in any such
businesses, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other affiliates)
that, in the case of all such requirements described in clause (i) and (ii),
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such requirements, (1) materially and adversely impact the expected pro
forma financial data (including expected cost-savings) of Parent
following consummation of the Merger as agreed by Parent and the Company and
(2) be different in any material respect in character, degree or scope from
the terms or conditions customarily imposed in connection with such consents,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings or
authorizations by the appropriate Governmental Authority in the face of
circumstances that are substantially similar to those circumstances in
question in light of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, in respect of the business, financial
condition, scope and size of the parties hereto) (a "Burdensome
Condition").   54     (e) The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing (i) the unconditional consent to the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby of each lender to whom
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owes in excess of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) as of the Closing Date, (ii) the unconditional consent to
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby of each Person
holding a mortgage or lien on real property or material personal property
owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the
unconditional consent to the Closing and the other transactions contemplated
hereby of each lessor of real property leased by the Company to the extent
required by such lease, and (iv) the unconditional consent to the Closing and
the other transactions contemplated hereby of each other party to each
Material Contract with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, but only
if and to the extent that the failure to obtain such consent would materially
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  
Section 6.8 Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense of any litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Acquisition Proposal and will not settle or compromise any such action
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   Section 6.9 Employee Benefits.  
(a) For the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to individuals who are
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation ("Affected Employees")
employee benefits (including, but not limited to, pension and welfare
benefits, but excluding any equity-based or incentive compensation) that in
the aggregate are no less favorable in any material respect than the employee
benefits provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company
to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (except such
changes as are required by Law); provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 6.9 shall operate to duplicate any benefit.   (b) Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-
work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Affected Employees under all employee benefit plans of
Parent or Subsidiary of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation that such employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries would be eligible to participate in after the Effective
Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that were in effect with
respect to such employees as of the Effective Time under any employee benefit
plan maintained by the Company or such Subsidiary for the Affected Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Affected Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time during the same plan year in which  
55    such co-payments and deductibles were paid, and (iii) give full
credit, for all purposes under all employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (to the extent such Affected
Employees participate in any such employee benefit plan or arrangement) for
such Affected Employees\' service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the crediting shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit.   Section 6.10 Public Announcements. The initial
press release with respect to the Merger shall be a joint press release, to
be agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except as required by
Law or stock exchange rules and regulations, each party hereto (a) shall
consult with the other party before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (to the extent not previously issued or made in
substance), and (b) shall not issue any press release or make any public
statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   Section 6.11 Further Assurances.
At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or other documents, or instruments,
and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, reasonably necessary to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger and
to otherwise accomplish the purpose and intent of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 6.12 Notification of Certain
Matters.   (a) The Company shall notify Parent, and Parent, Buyer or
Merger Subsidiary shall notify the Company, of (i) any fact, event,
circumstance, change, condition, or effect that has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or Parent, as applicable, (ii) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, and (iii) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in each case within three (3) business days of
such Person becoming aware of the occurrence of such development; provided
that the failure of any party to give a notice shall not render any
underlying breach of representation or warranty a breach of, or a failure to
comply with, a covenant for the purposes of this Agreement. Failure to comply
with this Section 6.12(a) shall not result in a failure by any party to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3, as the case may
be, unless the event or matter giving rise to the obligation to notify
hereunder involves a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder which
results in a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section  
56    7.2(a) or 7.3, as the case may be, and which breach is incurable or
has not been cured in all material respects as contemplated by Section
8.1(f).   (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent, Buyer or Merger Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) any material notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) If any event or matter
arises after the date of this Agreement that, if existing or occurring at the
date of this Agreement, (i) would have been required to be set forth or
described by the Company in the Company Disclosure Letter or by Parent in the
Parent Disclosure Letter, or (ii) would have caused a representation or
warranty or covenant in Articles IV, V or VI hereof, as applicable, to be
violated as of such date, then the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall,
for informational purposes only, deliver to Parent or the Company, as
applicable, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, updated to reflect such event or matter (A) immediately prior to
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to shareholders of the Company
and Parent, and (B) two (2) business days prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that such supplemental disclosure shall not be required to
disclose any such event or matter, and the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall not be required to be updated,
in either case, with respect to representations or warranties that are
expressly made as of a specific date; provided, further, however, that
the failure of any party to give such notice shall not render any underlying
breach of representation or warranty a breach of, or a failure to comply
with, a covenant for the purposes of this Agreement. Failure to comply with
this Section 6.12(c) shall not result in a failure by any party to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3, as the case may be, unless
the event or matter giving rise to the obligation to notify hereunder
involves a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder which results in
a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3, as
the case may be, and which breach is incurable or has not been cured in all
material respects as contemplated by Section 8.1(f).   (d) The parties\'
obligations under this Section 6.12 and the disclosure of any matter in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.12 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
disclosure and shall not be deemed to cure any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement.   Section 6.13 Director
and Officer Liability.   (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) for a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time indemnify and hold harmless all current or former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in their
capacities as such) (the "Indemnified Parties") to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to
the   57    articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and applicable Law for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) cause to be maintained for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time a policy of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured than the
terms currently provided to directors and officers of the Company with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time with either the Company\'s current provider of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance or with another provider, but only with a
provider whose A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") rating is at least as
high as the A.M. Best rating of the Company\'s current provider of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company as of
the date hereof as set forth in Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the "Company\'s Current Premium"), and if such annual premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
the Company\'s Current Premium, then Parent shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in Parent\'s reasonable good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the Company\'s Current Premium;
provided, further, however, that the Indemnified Parties may be required to
make application and provide reasonable and customary representations and
warranties to the relevant insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance. The provisions of this Section 6.12(a) shall be deemed to
have been satisfied if the Surviving Corporation obtains prepaid policies,
which policies provide directors and officers of the Company with coverage no
less advantageous to the insured than the terms currently provided to
directors and officers of the Company for an aggregate period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, with either the
Company\'s current provider of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
or with another provider, but only with a provider whose A.M. Best rating is
at least as high as the A.M. Best rating of the Company\'s current provider
of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance.   (b) Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.13(a) following the
Effective Time, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of actions or omissions by them in their capacities
as directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, shall promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation thereof; provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.13(a) unless and
to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
Surviving Corporation.   (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made
against any Indemnified Party, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.13 shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.   58     (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effect such assumption, proper provisions shall be made
so that such successors and assigns shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.   (e) The provisions of this
Section 6.13 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives,
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.   Section 6.14 Affiliates. As soon as practicable after the
date hereof and in any event not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, may be, as of the date
of the Company Shareholder Meeting, its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the delivery to Parent of letter agreements in substantially the
form attached as Exhibit A.   Section 6.15 Takeover Statutes. If any anti-
takeover or similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties and their Board of
Directors shall grant or secure any required consents or approvals and take
all such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
(including any resulting delays) of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 6.16 Comfort Letter. Upon the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to Parent a letter from the Company\'s independent
accountants, dated a date within two (2) business days before the date on
which the Form S-4 shall become effective, addressed to Parent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in

Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction seeking to (i) enjoin,
restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, (ii) impose

Company and Parent;   (b) by either the Company or Parent,   (i) if the
Merger has not been consummated as of March 31,  2005 (the "End Date");

obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the  Parent
Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof;   (c) by either the Company

illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any judgment, injunction, order or
decree enjoining Parent, Buyer, Merger Subsidiary or the Company from
consummating the Merger is entered and such judgment, injunction, order or
decree shall become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this   62    Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) is
not available to a party that has not fulfilled its obligations under Section
6.7;   (d) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company

of the issuance of the Parent Class A Common Shares in the Merger (or shall
have withdrawn, qualified, modified or amended (or proposed to withdraw,
qualify, modify or amend such recommendation) in any manner adverse to the
Company);   (f) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been
a breach by the other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in
the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a) (in the case of a breach by the Company) or Section 7.3 (in the case
of a breach by Parent), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been received
by the party alleged to be in breach; or   (g) by Parent, if the Average
Sales Price is less than $12.00.  The party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this Section
8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with Section 9.3, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.   Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto, except (i) as set forth in Section 8.3, (ii) that Sections 8.2, 8.3
and 6.4(b), Article IX and the agreements contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (to the extent set forth therein), shall survive the termination
hereof, and (iii) that no such termination shall relieve any party of any
liability or damages resulting from any breach by that party of this
Agreement prior to such termination.   Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.  
(a) Other than as specifically provided in this Section 8.3 or otherwise
agreed to in writing by the parties, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, except that (i) filing   63    fees in
connection with the filing with the SEC of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (ii) filing fees payable under or pursuant to the HSR
Act, and (iii) all printing, mailing and related expenses incurred
in connection with printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Company,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.   (b) If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to:   (i) Section 8.1(b)(ii) and (A) at the time of the
Company  Shareholder Meeting there shall have been outstanding or there shall
have  been publicly announced a plan, intention or proposal (whether or not 
conditional) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, which plan,  intention
or proposal has not been bona fide and irrevocably withdrawn and  (B) within
twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement, the  Company shall
enter into any Contract with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal is consummated at any time  thereafter), whether or not
such Acquisition Proposal was publicly  announced prior to the termination of
this Agreement;   (ii) Section 8.1(d); or   (iii) Section 8.1(f), based on
a breach of this Agreement by  the Company (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty, to  the extent intentional), and, in any such
case, (A) at the time of such  termination, there shall have been
outstanding, there shall have been  under consideration by the Company, or
there shall have been publicly  announced a plan, intention or proposal
(whether or not conditional) with  respect to an Acquisition Proposal, which
plan, intention or proposal has  not been bona fide and irrevocably withdrawn
and (B) within twelve (12)  months after termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall enter into  any Contract with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition  Proposal is consummated at any time thereafter),
whether or not such  Acquisition Proposal was publicly announced prior to the
termination of  this Agreement;  then Parent would suffer direct and
substantial damages, which damages cannot be determined with reasonable
certainty and, in order to compensate Parent for such damages the Company
shall pay to Parent as liquidated damages the amount of seven million six
hundred seventy-three thousand dollars ($7,673,000) by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent
(the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be due and payable (A) in
the case of any termination by Parent, within three (3) business days of
termination of this Agreement and (B) in the case of any termination by the
Company, immediately prior to (and as condition to) such termination, except
that in the case of a termination fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i)
or (iii), such Termination Fee will be due upon, and as a condition to the
validity of, the consummation of the relevant Acquisition Proposal. It is
specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section
8.3(b) represents liquidated damages and not a penalty.   64     (c)
The Company and Parent each hereby acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, neither the Company nor
Parent would enter into this Agreement. The payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall be in lieu of any other liabilities or
damages with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, except as otherwise provided in clause (iii) of Section 8.2.  
ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 9.1 Non-Survival of Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties contained herein and in
any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive
the Effective Time; provided, that nothing in this Section 9.1 shall relieve
the parties or their respective Representatives of any liability following
the Effective Time for any willful or fraudulent misrepresentations contained
herein or in any other certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto. This
Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.   Section 9.2
Amendments; No Waivers.   (a) Any provision of this Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) may be amended or
waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company,
Parent, Buyer and Merger Subsidiary, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Share Issuance
Approval, as applicable, if any such amendment or waiver shall by Law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of any relevant securities exchange
or market require further approval of the shareholders of the Company or
Parent, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
necessary shareholder approval.   (b) No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.   Section 9.3

rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other
parties hereto, except that Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in
whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve Merger Subsidiary of its
obligations hereunder.   Section 9.5 Governing Law. This Agreement,
including all matters of construction, validity and performance, shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of laws) as
to all matters, including but not limited to, matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.   67     Section 9.6
Jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in any
federal or state court located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and
each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such
suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 9.3 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.   Section 9.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 9.8 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which together
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.   Section 9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede
and cancel all prior agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings,
understandings and communications of the parties, oral and written, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.   Section 9.10 Third
Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any instrument
or document executed by any party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have been
executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a party hereto or thereto
or a permitted successor or assign of such a party; provided, however, that
the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that the provisions of Section
6.13 hereof are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, affected
thereby.   Section 9.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an   68    acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 9.12 Specific
Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any
party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its
failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation
of the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party\'s obligations and
to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder without proof of actual damages and without any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Such remedy shall not be
deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a party\'s breach of its obligations
but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law
or equity.   Section 9.13 Construction; Interpretation; Disclosure
Letters.   (a) The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, (i) unless
otherwise specified herein, the term "affiliate," with respect to any Person,
shall mean and include any Person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with such Person, (ii) the term "including" shall mean "including,
without limitation", (iii) words in the singular shall be held to include the
plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to include the
other genders as the context requires, (iv) the words "hereof," "herein," and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, and article, section, paragraph, exhibit and
schedule references are to the articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and
schedules of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, (v) the word "or"
shall not be exclusive, and (vi) Parent, Buyer, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company will be referred to herein individually as a "party" and collectively
as "parties" (except where the context otherwise requires). Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning. A reference to any party to this Agreement or any
other agreement or document shall include such party\'s successors and
permitted assigns.   (b) The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.   (c) Any reference to any
federal, state, local or non-United States statute or Law shall be deemed
also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context otherwise requires.   69     (d) A matter set forth in one
section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter need
not be set forth in any other section of such disclosure letter so long as
its relevance to such other section of the disclosure letter or section of
this Agreement is readily apparent on the face of the information disclosed
in such disclosure letter. The fact that any item of information is disclosed
in a disclosure letter shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Any information or the dollar
thresholds set forth in a disclosure letter shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material" "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar
terms in this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set forth in such
disclosure letter.   [Signature page follows]   70     IN WITNESS
