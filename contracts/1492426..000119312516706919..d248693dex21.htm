THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of September 12, 2016 by and among Horizon Pharma plc, a public
limited company organized under the laws of Ireland (" _Parent_ "), Misneach

Agreement are defined in _Article X_.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Parent
has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be
extended, amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company
Share_ _s_ ," and each such share a " _Company Share_ "), at a price of $9.00
per Company Share, net to the holder thereof, in cash, without interest
thereon (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and each Company Share that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Canceled Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) will thereupon be canceled and converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
are fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) declared it advisable to the Company to enter into this Agreement, (iii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the performance by the
Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation
of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, (iv) agreed that the Merger shall be effected under Section
251(h) of the DGCL and (v) resolved, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares to Merger
Sub pursuant to the Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
and declared advisable this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of their respective covenants and agreements contained herein and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub entering into this
Agreement, certain holders of Company Shares (the " _Principal Stockholders_
") have entered into tender and support agreements, dated as of the date
hereof, pursuant to which, among other things, each of the
Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender his, her or its Company Shares to
Merger Sub in the Offer (the " _Tender Agreements_ ").

 



1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Company
Shares at a price per Company Share (such date, the " _Offer Commencement
Date_ "), subject to the terms of  _Section_ _ _ _2.11_ , equal to the Offer
Price. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the Company Stockholders and
contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in _Annex
A_. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Company Shares validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of:

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the Expiration
Time, there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, in
each case, in accordance with the terms of the Offer a number of Company
Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective controlled Affiliates (if any), represent one more
than 50% of the sum of (x) all then outstanding Company Shares (not including
Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures for which
the underlying Company Shares have not yet been delivered) plus (y) the
aggregate number of Company Shares issuable to holders of Company Options from
which the Company has received valid notices of exercise (including payment of
any applicable exercise price in accordance with the terms of the Company
Stock Plans and applicable award agreement) prior to the expiration of the
Offer (and as to which Company Shares have not yet been issued to such
exercising holders of Company Options), _plus_ (z) the aggregate number of
Company Shares issuable to holders of Company Convertible Notes from which the
Company has received valid notices of conversion to Company Shares in
accordance with the Company Convertible Notes prior to the expiration of the
Offer (and as to which Company Shares have not yet been issued to such
exercising holders of Company Convertible Notes); and

 

(ii) each of the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_.

 

(b) _Waiver of Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive
any of the conditions to the Offer, and to increase the Offer Price or to
make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth herein, without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole
and absolute discretion, Merger Sub may not (and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to) (i) waive or modify the Minimum Condition or the conditions set
forth in _clauses (1)_ , _(4)_ or _(9)_ of _Annex A_ , or (ii) make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer Price or the
number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer or the
Expiration Time, except as permitted or required by _Section_ _ _ _1.1(c)_ ,
(D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex A_ ,
(E) modifies the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ or (F) amends any
other term or condition of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the
Company Stockholders.

 



2 (c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, at the end of
the day on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the Offer
Commencement Date determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule
14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (as such date and time may be extended, the "
_Expiration Time_ ") unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent and
the Company. In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and
at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section_ _ _ _1.1(c)(i)_ or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(A) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any Law or
Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff or NASDAQ, in any such case that is applicable to the Offer; and

 

(B) in the event that the Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions to
the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ are not satisfied or waived (if permitted
hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days
each (or any longer period as may be approved in advance by the Company) in
order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer;

_provided, however_ , that the foregoing _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_  of this
_Section_ _ _ _1.1(c)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_. 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner other
than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ _ _
_1.1(c)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

(iv) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub extend the offer beyond the Termination Date
without the prior written consent of the Company.

 

(v) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , in which case Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event later than one (1) Business
Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

(vi) If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , prior to the acceptance for
payment of Company Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly return or cause to be returned all
tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that
are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section_
_ _ _1.1(c)(ii)_ ). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the
funds necessary to pay for any and all Company Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to accept in the Offer and purchase pursuant to the Offer and this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that without the prior written consent of
the Company, Merger Sub shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company
Shares if, as a result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of
Company Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the holder thereof in cash.

 



3 (e) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act), Merger Sub and Parent shall:

(i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, which Schedule TO shall contain
as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement and other required or customary ancillary documents, in
each case, in respect of the Offer (together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

(ii) deliver a copy of the Offer Documents, including all exhibits thereto,
to the Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule
14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;

 

(iii) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Offer Documents, to NASDAQ in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

 

(iv) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all Company Stockholders
as and to the extent required by applicable Law (including the Exchange Act).

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Law. The Company shall furnish in writing to Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required
by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or the Merger Sub to be
included in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents so as to enable Parent and
Merger Sub to comply with their obligations under this _Section_ _ _ _1.1(f)_.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for use in the Schedule
TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the Company

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Shares_. Each Company Share that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but excluding (A) Canceled Company Shares, (B)
Accepted Company Shares and (C) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon,
upon the surrender of the certificate representing such Company Share in the
manner provided in _Section_ _ _ _2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided
in _Section_ _ _ _2.10_ ).

(ii) _Excluded Company Shares_. Each Company Share (A) owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ")
or (B) irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer (" _Accepted
Company Shares_ "), shall, in each case, be canceled at the Effective Time by
virtue of the Merger without any consideration paid therefor (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, any consideration that
remains payable with respect to any such Accepted Company Shares pursuant to
the Offer).

 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who are entitled to demand and
who shall have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all respects
with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.7(a)_ , but instead will be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
holder of Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by any Company Stockholder who
shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section
262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares
and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Company
Shares in the manner provided in _Section_ _ _ _2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



7 (c) _Company Options_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the vesting of each Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full.
Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option that remains
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated as of
the Effective Time, and each holder of each such Company Option with an
exercise price per Company Share that is less than the Offer Price (each, an "
_In-the-money Option_ ") shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation promptly
after the Effective Time, subject to _Section_ _ _ _2.8(e)_ , an amount in
cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the amount,
if any, by which the Offer Price exceeds the per share exercise price of such
Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ ");  _provided_ , if it is
reasonably determined that such Company Options cannot be automatically
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and
other terms of such Company Options, including those set forth in any
separate agreement between the Company and the holder(s) of such Company
Options, the holder(s) of such Company Options shall be required, prior to
receiving the Option Consideration payable in respect of such Company Options
under this Agreement, to deliver to the Surviving Corporation an option
cancellation agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation in respect of such Company Options. For the avoidance of doubt,
no Option Consideration shall be payable with respect to any Company Option
with a per share exercise price that equals or exceeds the amount of the Offer
Price and such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without
any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation to, pay through Parents, the Surviving Corporations or
the applicable Subsidiarys payroll to the holders of Company Options who are
current or former employees of the Company the Option Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section_
_ _ _2.8(e)_ , as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and in
no event later than fifteen (15) days after the Closing). All other payments
under this Agreement to holders of Company Options, in respect of such
Company Options, who are not current or former employees (each, a " _Non-
Employee Option Holder_ ") shall be made by the Payment Agent, on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (and in no event later than the second regular payroll period after the
Closing; _provided_ that such holder has delivered to the Payment Agent a
completed and duly executed Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN, as applicable).

 

(d) _Company RSU Awards_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the vesting of each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full, (ii)
each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and
(iii) each holder of each such Company RSU Award shall be entitled to be paid
by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the Effective Time, subject to
_Section_ _ _ _2.8(e)_ , an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal
to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company
Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation to, pay through Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the
applicable Subsidiarys payroll to the holders of Company RSU Awards who are
current or former employees of the Company the RSU Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ _
_ _2.8(e)_ , as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and in
no event later than fifteen (15) days after the Closing). All other payments
under this Agreement to holders of Company RSU Awards, in respect of such
Company RSU Awards, who are not current or former employees (each, " _Non-
Employee RSU Award Holder_ ") shall be made by the Payment Agent, on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (and in no event later than the second regular payroll period after the
Closing; _provided_ that such holder has delivered to the Payment Agent a
completed and duly executed Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN, as applicable).

 

(e) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to (i) operate the Company ESPP in accordance with its terms as in
effect on the date of this Agreement from the period of time commencing on the
date of this Agreement and ending on the Effective Time, (ii) cause any

 



8  offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased)
that would otherwise be underway as of the Effective Time under the Company
ESPP in accordance with its terms on the date of this Agreement to be the
final offering period under the Company ESPP and such offering period shall be
terminated no later than the last payroll period that ends at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final Exercise Date_ ");
(iii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective
and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iv)
cause each participants share purchase rights under the Company ESPP (the "
_Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; and
(v) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the Final
Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP
within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each
participant under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase Company Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased
thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)_. No further Company ESPP
Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final
Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to the
ESPP participants of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination
of the Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

 

(f) _Loan Payoff_. As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall satisfy all
notification requirements required in connection in with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement under the terms of the Company Loan Agreement,
including providing notice to Healthcare Royalty Partners II, L.P. of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as provided for under the terms of
the Company Loan Agreement. No less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent a customary
payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") for any amounts owed by the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company Loan Agreement, which Payoff
Letter shall (i) provide the dollar amount of all indebtedness required to be
paid under the Company Loan Agreement in order to fully and finally pay off
such indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), and (ii)
indicate that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall be discharged
from any and all obligations pursuant to such indebtedness (and any
documentation in connection therewith shall terminate) and that all Liens
securing the indebtedness shall be released from and after the Closing Date
automatically upon payment of the Payoff Amount. Parent shall pay, or shall
cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to pay, the Payoff Amount in full on
behalf of the Company on the Closing Date.

 

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company
Stockholders, Non-Employee Option Holders and Non-Employee RSU Award Holders,
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , an amount of cash equal to
the aggregate cash consideration to which Company Stockholders, Non-Employee
Option Holders and Non-Employee RSU Award Holders are entitled under this
_Article II_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Option
Consideration or the RSU Consideration, as applicable). Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall
be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which
are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such
cash amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. No investment or losses thereon shall affect the consideration to
which Company Stockholders are entitled under this _Article II_ and to the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the amount
required to promptly pay in full the cash amounts contemplated by this
_Article II_ ,

 



9  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such
payments contemplated by this _Article II_. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares, and (ii) non-
certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Uncertificated
Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.7(a)_ , (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and Parent and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, as applicable, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company
Shares represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.7(a)_ , _by_
(y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Each Non-Employee Option Holder and Non-Employee RSU
Award Holder who provides the Paying Agent a completed and duly executed Form
W-9 or Form W-8BEN, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such Company Award the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon receipt of an "agents message"
by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _2.7(a)_ , _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares representing any Dissenting Company Shares) shall,
from and after the Effective Time, evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, and established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws.
To

 



10  the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld, each such payor
shall take all action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so
withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Body and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any Company Stockholders
who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _2.8_ shall thereafter look solely to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Company Shares represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, as a general creditor thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares shall (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing
Dissenting Company Shares, which shall be subject to _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ )
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _2.8_ (or, for the avoidance
of doubt and without duplication, any consideration that remains payable with
respect to any Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the Offer). The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time and at the
close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company with respect to the shares of Company shares shall be closed.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the
form and substance as reasonably requested by the Payment Agent, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.7(a)_ ;
_provided, however_ , that the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a customary
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Adjustments to the Offer Price and Merger Consideration_. The Offer
Price and Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares),
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized and existing
and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized in the
applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, with all requisite power and authority to own its properties and
conduct its business as currently conducted, except for such failures to be in
good standing or have such power that would not, individual or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity
authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character
of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified and in good standing that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar

Subsidiaries.

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Subsidiary

12  its directors and officers (or applicable equivalent). Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any equity interest
in any Person other than the Companys Subsidiaries set forth on _Section

consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,

decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the principal
executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the

a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any material Contract or obligation to which Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets may be bound, or (d)

4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or relating to Parent or

is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or hinder the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.6 _Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is,
or has been at any time during the period commencing three (3) years prior to
the date hereof through the date hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. None of Parent,
Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates directly or indirectly owns any
Company Shares, other than shares beneficially owned through benefit or
pension plans.

4.7  _Financing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Bank of
America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Jefferies Finance LLC, Cowen and
Company, LLC and Cowen Structured Holdings, Inc. (together with all exhibits,
annexes, schedules and attachments thereto, including the Fee Letter relating
thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders party thereto have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Horizon Pharma, Inc., or another
Subsidiary of Parent (as applicable, " _Borrower_ "), for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such financing, the
" _Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ that the Fee Letter shall have been
redacted with respect to fees and other provisions that do not affect the
conditionality of the Debt Financing.

 

(b) The Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date hereof, in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment,
supplement or modification is presently contemplated by Parent, Borrower or
Merger Sub (other than amendments or

 



29  modifications that are permitted by _Section 6.16(b)_ ). The Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower and, to the
Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, the other parties thereto. Except for the
Debt Commitment Letter and the engagement letter entered into in connection
therewith (which letter does not modify or amend the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter), as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Borrower, Merger Sub or Parent and (in the case of the
Debt Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent) any of
the other parties thereto, under any term of the Debt Commitment Letter
(provided that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III, or the Companys compliance with its
obligations under the terms of this Agreement). Borrower, Merger Sub and
Parent have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date
hereof. Assuming (i) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ , (iii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), and
(iv) the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement,
the aggregate net proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with Parents
consolidated cash, will be sufficient for the acquisition of all
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, to
pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to make payments to all
holders of outstanding In-the-money Options and Company RSU Awards under
_Section 2.7_ , as applicable, and the payment of all other amounts required
to be paid by Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of
the transactions.

 

4.8 _No Other Operations_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
effecting the Merger. Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective
Time engage in any activities other than those contemplated by this Agreement
and has, and will have as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, no
liabilities other than those contemplated by this Agreement.

4.9 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders, financial advisors or similar fee payable to any broker, finder or
investment banker in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent and Merger
Sub.

 

4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this  _Article IV_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub
nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or
with respect to any other information provided to the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.11 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent and Merger
Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries makes, or has made, any representations or warranties
relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger
and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty
except for those expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, (b)
no Person has been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or
otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation
or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions,
data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials
or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include
representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the

5.3 _No Solicitati_ _on_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.3(c)_ , at all times during the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they
authorize or permit any of their 

 



33  respective directors, officers or other employees, controlled Affiliates, or
any investment banker, attorney or other authorized agent or representative
retained by any of them (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or knowingly
facilitate or assist (including by way of providing information), any proposal
that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives) regarding

agreement, letter of intent or similar agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement

provision of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement, standstill or
similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or (v) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect

any Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the
Company will request that each Person (if any) that has executed
a confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement)
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal promptly return to the Company or
destroy all non-public documents and materials furnished by the Company or any
of its Representatives to such Person pursuant to the terms of such
confidentiality agreement and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal
previously granted to any such Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may
participate in discussions solely to seek to clarify the terms and conditions
of any inquiry or proposal made by any Person.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) following
receipt of any inquiry or request which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal by the Company or any of
its Representatives, the Company shall (i) provide Parent with written notice
of the receipt of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and (ii) communicate to
Parent the identity of the Person making such inquiry, request or
Acquisition Proposal, a copy of any written materials related thereto (or, if
oral, a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such inquiry,
request or Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt and timely basis (and in any event within 24 hours) with
respect to any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding
any such inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal, including by prompt notice
(and in any event within 24 hours) of any material amendments or
modifications thereto and all material written materials subsequently provided
in connection therein and upon request of Parent, shall promptly inform Parent
of the status of such inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.3_
or otherwise contained in this Agreement, if at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time (i) the Company has received an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not result from any breach of
this _Section_ _ _ _5.3_ , and (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action described in _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ below would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (x) the Company shall
substantially concurrently provide to Parent any information concerning the
Company that is provided to any Person and which was not previously provided
to Parent and (y) the Company shall have entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal (and waive such Persons noncompliance with the
provisions of any "standstill" agreement solely to the extent necessary to
permit such discussions or negotiations). Prior to or concurrently with the
Company first taking any of the actions described in _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_
of the immediately preceding sentence

 



34  with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written
notice to Parent of the determination of the Company Board made pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ of the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that in the event any
Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would be in
violation of the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ , the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of _Section 5.3(a)_.

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

6.1  _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section_ _ _ _6.1_ , the Company Board

their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or rescind (or
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly
propose to withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve,
recommend or declare advisable or publicly propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) fail to include the Company

Recommendation Change_ ") or (iv) approve, recommend or declare advisable
or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable or allow the Company to
execute or enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board or any committee thereof to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change so long as any such disclosure does not include a
Company Board Recommendation Change.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may
(i) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in each case in response to a
Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event; _provided_ that (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel) that the applicable
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company provides
written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior to effecting a
Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _8.1(f)_ of its intent to take such action, specifying the

prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(f),_ the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day
period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(f)_. Following

conditions of an applicable Acquisition Proposal or material change in the
Effect constituting an Intervening Event, the Company shall provide a new
Notice of Intended Recommendation Change to Parent, and any Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination

14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to
the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that any disclosure or position described in
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , shall be deemed a Company Board Recommendation
Change unless the Companys Board of Directors reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such disclosure or in connection with such action.

6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its respective
Representatives to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Offer, the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each of the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Section_ _ _ _1.1(a)_ and _Annex A_ and
each of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement; (ii)
without limitation of _Section 6.3_ , obtain, as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, and maintain all necessary actions or non-actions
and Consents from any Governmental Bodies and make all necessary

necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger; and (iii) at the written
request of Parent, obtain all necessary Consents from third parties under any
Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent or Merger
Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to, or would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of, preventing, impairing, materially delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
or the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall
not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other
similar fee, "profit-sharing" or other similar payment or other consideration
(including increased rent or other similar payments or agree to or enter into
any amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers of) the
existing terms of any Contract), provide additional security (including a
guaranty) or otherwise assume or incur or agree to assume or incur any
Liability that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, to
obtain any Consent of any Person (including any Governmental Body) under any
Contract.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees, on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates, that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and neither Parent nor
the Company shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into any definitive
agreements for, or consummate, an acquisition (via stock purchase, merger,
consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) of any ownership interest in,
or assets of, any Person if such ownership interest or assets
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to obtain any
regulatory approvals required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), or would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

6.3 _Antitrust Filings_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and

 



36  Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as required by the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate
and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the
other with any information and documentary material that may be required in
order to make such filings, (iii) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC or the DOJ, and (iv) take
any and all action necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event by the date that is at least five (5) Business Days before the
Expiration Time), and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger under any Antitrust Laws, including (A) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, conduct of business restrictions, a sale or disposition of such
assets or businesses as are required to be divested or a license or grant of
commercialization rights to businesses, product lines, fields of use,
divisions, business arrangements, Contracts, assets or interests therein of
Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), (B) amending any venture or other arrangement
of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates), and (C) otherwise taking or committing to take actions after the
Closing with respect to one or more of the businesses, product lines, fields
of use, or assets of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), in each case, as may be required in order to
enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no
later than the Termination Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Further, and for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent will not extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the
DOJ or any other Governmental Body not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of
the Company.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Body
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental Body
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including
any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or an
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Body with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Body,
the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of
all meetings and conference calls with any Governmental Body relating to
the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate
in each of such meetings and conference calls, (iii) keep the other party
reasonably apprised with respect to any oral communications with any
Governmental Body regarding the Offer or the Merger, (iv) cooperate in the
filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
or other written communications explaining or defending the Offer and the
Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Body, (v) provide each other
with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider
in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Body regarding the Offer
and the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as
appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Body relating to the Offer or the Merger, and (vii) cooperate and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and
consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all material
deliberations with respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth
in _clauses (1)_ and _(4)_ of _Annex A_ and _Section 7.1(b)_. Any such
disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one party
to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
applicable Law or to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company.

 



37 (c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _6.3(a)_ are required to be or should be made,
and whether any other Consents not contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _6.3(a)_
are required to be or should be obtained, from any Governmental Body under
any other applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish information
required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any such Consents
that the parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.4 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification agreements
(in substantially the form made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors or officers, and any person who becomes
a director or officer prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ "), and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
on the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are no less favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates
of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six
(6) year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required
by applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of  _Section 6.4_ ,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any
threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding, investigation,
arbitration or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (each, an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ "), to the extent such
Indemnified Proceeding arises out of or pertains directly to (1) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director or officer (including as a fiduciary with respect to an
employee benefit plan) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by reason
of the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was serving at the request of
the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director or officer (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of another Person at or
prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), including any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting in good
faith a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.4(b)_ , then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
advance, prior to the final disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding for
which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following
request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses)
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such Indemnified
Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to 

 



38  repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

(c) During the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person covered by the Companys currently in force directors and officers
liability insurance (" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those of
the Current Company DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying
its obligations under this  _Section_ _ _ _6.4(c)_ , Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual amount paid by the Company for coverage
during its current coverage period (such three hundred percent (300%) amount,
the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ that, if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current
Company DandO Insurance at a cost not to exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. In
the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 6.4(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect. Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with the Company to ensure that directors and officers liability
insurance remains in effect with respect to the Indemnified Persons at all
times prior to the Effective Time, including, if necessary, by obtaining a
waiver from any applicable insurers of termination of any such directors and
officers liability insurance as a result of the occurrence of the Acceptance
Time (as opposed to the Effective Time).

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section 6.4_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive the occurrence of
the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person
without the written consent of such affected Indemnified Person. It is
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as may
be reasonably necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in the foregoing shall require the Company
Board to take any action that would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

6.6 _Section_ _ _ _16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including "derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under
the Exchange Act)) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any director or executive officer of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



39 6.7 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not, from and after the date of this Agreement and until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any
plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is
paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to
any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, unless prior to
such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the compensation
committee of the Company Board (each member of which the Company Board
determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of the applicable
NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any
such action) shall have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary
to (a) approve as an employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b)
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

6.8 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or shall cause its
Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of NASDAQ or any other applicable stock exchange on which Parent
may be listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or
parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of
any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth
in this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ shall not apply to any release or announcement
made or proposed to be made by the Company with respect to or in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or the matters addressed in _Section
6.1_. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the
form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
to the extent the content of any press release or other announcement has been
approved and made in accordance with this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ , no separate
approval shall be required in respect of such content to the extent
replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press release or other
announcement, and (b) each party may, without complying with the foregoing
obligations, make any public statement regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby in response to questions from the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences, and make internal
announcements to employees, in each case to the extent that such statements
are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties or approved by the parties, and
otherwise in compliance with this _Section_ _ _ _6.8,_ and provided that such
public statements do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Acceptance Time, as applicable. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume, honor, and provide all of the Companys Plans that
provide for severance and change in control obligations in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) provide to each Continuing Employee (i) a base salary or wage rate, as
applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than
the base salary or wage

 



40  rate (as applicable) and annual bonus opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash and
COBRA premium severance benefits that are at least as favorable as the cash
and COBRA premium severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) other welfare benefits
(excluding any equity-based or equity-related compensation and any
benefits provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension plans) that are,
taken as a whole, at least as favorable in the aggregate as selected in
Parents sole discretion to either (A) those generally made available to
similarly situated employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries under its
welfare benefit plans and programs, or (B) to the compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) To the extent that a Plan or any other employee benefit plan or other
compensation or severance arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") or any employee benefit
plan or other compensation or severance arrangement of Parent is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time solely for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant; _provided, however_ , that such service
need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the
" _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New
Plan will be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins will be given full credit under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan are
credited with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee
under the applicable Company Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 6.9_ shall create such rights in
any such Persons.

 

6.10 _Termination of Company 401(k) Plan_.

 

(a) Contingent upon the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary
actions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, with such termination effective
as of no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. The
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any resolutions or other corporate
action (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent,, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) evidencing that the Company 401(k) Plan will be
terminated

 



41  effective as of no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing
Date, contingent upon the Closing Date, and will adopt any necessary
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan to effect such termination

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) provide to
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date benefits under the Parent 401(k)
Plan, subject to and in accordance with its terms, and (ii) allow Continuing
Employees to make eligible rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan
of their Company 401(k) Plan account balances (in cash and in loan notes
evidencing loans to such Continuing Employees as of the date of distribution)
from the Company 401(k) Plan, in each case as soon as practicable following
the Closing Date.

8.4 _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(a) _Company Termination Fee_. The Company shall pay to Parent an amount
equal to $30,000,000 in cash (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Parent:

 

(i) within two (2) Business Days after written demand by Parent, in the event
that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_ , and the right to terminate this

(C) within twelve (12) months following such termination of this Agreement,
either (y) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to

"Acquisition Transaction" except that all references therein to "more than

percent (50%)."

payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

 

(c) _Company Termination Fee as Liquidated Damages_. The parties acknowledge
that the agreements contained in _Section 8.4_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. The payment by the Company of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.4_ and, to the extent applicable, any
amounts payable under _Section 8.4(d)_ , shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in the event of termination of this Agreement
under circumstances requiring the payment of a Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.4_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
Parent shall receive the Company Termination Fee (and, to the
extent applicable, any amounts payable under _Section 8.4(d))_ , the receipt
thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Parent Related Parties in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination
thereof or any matter forming the basis for such termination), including the
Offer and the Merger, and in such case no Parent Related Party shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding or make any claim against
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ")
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.4(c)_  shall relieve the Company
or any of its Affiliates from any liability for common law fraud or willful
and material breach of this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

 

(d) _Consequences of Non-Payment_. If the Company fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.4_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment
against the Company for the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to
Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
out-of-pocket attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Company Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime
lending rate prevailing as published in The Wall Street Journal for the
period from the date such Company Termination Fee was initially due to the
date of payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company is the
prevailing party in such suit, Parent shall pay to the Company its reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

8.5 _Non-Recourse Against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (a) none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any rights or claims for any type of damages against any entities that have
committed to provide or arrange or have otherwise entered into agreements in
connection with all or any part of the Debt Financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter and any joinder agreements, indentures or credit agreements entered
into pursuant thereto or relating thereto and their respective Affiliates and
their and their Affiliates former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
advisors, agents, attorneys and Representatives and their successors and

rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any Financing

9.6 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.6_ and/or anything herein to the contrary,
each of the parties hereto and each Company Related Party (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross claim or
third party claim of any kind or nature (whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate
courts thereof)., (ii) submits for itself and its property with respect to any
such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) agrees that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to it at its address provided in _Section_ _ _ _9.2_ shall be effective
service of process against it for any such action brought in any such court,
(iv) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any term or other provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer and the Merger
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer
and the Merger be effected as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



52 9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, including _Section 8.4(c)_ , any and

law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled (without proof of
actual damages or otherwise or posting or securing any bond) to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or
parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

9.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _9.9_ shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
sitting in New Castle County within the State of Delaware) in the event any
dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect thereof; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court; (iv) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried
and determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other
state court sitting in New Castle County within the State of Delaware); (v)
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding
was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the
same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided,
however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to
seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final court
judgment.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this _clause (b)_
only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
