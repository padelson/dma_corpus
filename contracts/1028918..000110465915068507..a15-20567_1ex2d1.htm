 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

3.01 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of a holder of shares of SCB Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _PPBI Common Stock_. Each share of PPBI Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



 

(b) _SCB Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07 and 9.05,
each share of SCB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for,
the right to receive 0.9629 shares of PPBI Common Stock (the "Exchange
Ratio"), provided that the PPBI Average Share Price is equal to or greater
than $16.550 but less than or equal to $22.391. To the extent the PPBI Average
Share Price is less than $16.550, the Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient
resulting when (A) $15.936 is divided by (B) the PPBI Average Share Price,
rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth. To the extent the PPBI Average Share
Price is greater than $22.391, the Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient
resulting when (X) $21.560 is divided by (Y) the PPBI Average Share Price,
rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.

 



 

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. Provided that SCB has delivered, or
caused to be delivered, to Computershare, Inc. (the "Exchange Agent") all
information which is reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform
its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, promptly
following the Effective Date, mail or make available to each holder of record
of SCB Common Stock, a notice and a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
Certificate(s) theretofore representing shares of SCB Common Stock shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent)
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for
surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section
3.01(b) hereof deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. A
letter of transmittal will be properly completed only if accompanied by
Certificate or Certificates representing all shares of SCB Common Stock
covered thereby, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section
3.02.

 



 

(b) _PPBI Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates, PPBI shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates, or at
PPBIs option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number
of shares of PPBI Common Stock issuable to the holders of SCB Common Stock as
the Merger Consideration, to be given to the holders of SCB Common Stock in
exchange for their Certificates as provided in this Article III. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of PPBI Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

 



 

(i) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon
acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance
in book entry form, or upon written request of such holder a certificate or
certificates representing, the number of whole shares of PPBI Common Stock
into which the aggregate number of shares of SCB Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement and any other distribution theretofore
paid with respect to PPBI Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case,
without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices.

 



 

(ii) Each outstanding Certificate which prior to the Effective Time
represented SCB Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as
otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be
deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock into
which such SCB Common Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of SCB of Certificates
representing shares of SCB Common Stock and, if such Certificates are
presented to SCB for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of
certificates for PPBI Common Stock as hereinabove provided. No dividends which
have been declared will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares
of PPBI Common Stock under Section 3.01 until such Person surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing SCB Common Stock, at which time such
dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.

 



 

(d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of PPBI Common Stock in New
Names_. The Exchange Agent and PPBI, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares of PPBI
Common Stock to which a holder of SCB Common Stock would otherwise be entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates representing the shares of SCB Common Stock for exchange as
provided in this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be
reasonably required in each case by PPBI. If any certificates evidencing
shares of PPBI Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate evidencing SCB Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an
executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of PPBI Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of PPBI Common
Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by PPBI pursuant to Section 3.02(b) that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of SCB for six months after the
Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to PPBI. Any shareholders of SCB who have not
theretofore complied with Section 3.02(c) shall thereafter look only to PPBI
for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of SCB Common Stock
such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of SCB Common Stock
are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date
on which such shares of PPBI Common Stock would otherwise escheat to any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the
property of PPBI (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered
to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this
Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any
Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. PPBI and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of SCB to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration
specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, PPBI and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent
third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

 



 

3.03 _Rights as Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of SCB Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of SCB
other than to receive the consideration provided under this Article III.

 



 

3.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of PPBI Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of SCB Common Stock who
otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of PPBI Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the PPBI Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest
whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

 



 

3.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Each outstanding share of SCB Common Stock the
holder of which has perfected his right to dissent pursuant to Chapter 13 of
the CGCL, including making a demand of SCB to purchase his shares pursuant to
Section 1301 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL and submitting his shares for
endorsement pursuant to Section 1302 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the CGCL. SCB shall give PPBI
prompt notice upon receipt by SCB of any such written demands for payment of
the fair value of such shares of SCB Common Stock and of withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the CGCL. If any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise), the Dissenting Shares held
by such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be
made by PPBI or the Surviving Corporation within the time period set forth in
the CGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

3.06 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly; provided that an offering or sale
of PPBI Common Stock shall not be deemed a reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment of the PPBI Common
Stock.

 



 

3.07 _Withholding Rights_. PPBI (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of SCB Common Stock such
amounts as PPBI is required under the Code or any state, local or foreign Tax
law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of SCB Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by PPBI.

 



 

3.08 _SCB Options_. At the Effective Time, each SCB Option which is
outstanding, vested and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash
payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of SCB Common Stock
subject to such SCB Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
the excess, if any, of $18.75 over the exercise price per share of such SCB
Option (the "Option Merger Consideration"), less any applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share
of any such SCB Option is equal to or greater than $18.75, such SCB Option
shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. SCB
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of
each holder of a then-outstanding SCB Option with regard to the cancellation
of such SCB Option and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the SCB Stock Option Plans and all
SCB Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time.

 



 

3.09 _Reservation of Shares_. Prior to the Closing, the PPBI Board shall
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of PPBI Common Stock for
the purpose of issuing its shares in exchange for shares of SCB Common Stock
in the Merger.

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

5.01 _Disclosure Schedules_. On or prior to the date hereof, PPBI has
delivered to SCB a schedule and SCB has delivered to PPBI a schedule (each
respectively, its "Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things,
items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response
to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Section
5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained in Articles IV or
VI; provided, however, that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure
Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.02 _Standard_. Solely for the purposes of determining whether the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be, have been
satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or warranty
made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of SCB on the one hand
or PPBI on the other hand contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04,

 



      
 

 



 

respectively, other than the representations of SCB contained in Sections
5.03(b) and 5.03(m)(vi), which shall be true in all respects, shall be deemed
untrue or incorrect for purposes of Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and no party
hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for
purposes of such Sections, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or
taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with
any representation or warranty contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, has had or
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making
such representation or warranty.

 



 

5.03 _Representations and Warranties of SCB_. Subject to Sections 5.01 and
5.02, SCB hereby represents and warrants to PPBI:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of California. SCB is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property or
assets or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCB. SCB
has in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental
authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the SCB Articles and
SCB Bylaws which have previously been made available to PPBI are true,
complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The minute books of SCB and each of its Subsidiaries previously
made available to PPBI contain true, complete and correct records in all
material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or
taken of their respective shareholders and Boards of Directors (including
committees of their respective Board of Directors) through the date hereof.

 



 

(b) _SCB Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of SCB consists solely
of 40,000,000 shares of SCB Common Stock, of which 6,039,257 shares are issued

Common Stock were held in treasury by SCB or otherwise directly or indirectly

Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and non-assessable, and none of the outstanding shares of SCB Common
Stock or SCB SBLF Preferred Stock have been issued in violation of the
preemptive rights of any Person. Section 5.03(b) of SCBs Disclosure Schedule

grantee, the date of the grant, the status of the option grant as qualified or
non-qualified under Section 422 of the Code, the number of shares of SCB
Common Stock subject to each SCB Option, the number of shares of SCB Common
Stock subject to SCB Options that are currently exercisable and the exercise
or strike price per share. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
there are no shares of SCB Common Stock reserved for issuance, SCB does not
have any Rights issued or outstanding with respect to SCB Common Stock and SCB
does not have any commitment to authorize, issue or sell any SCB Common Stock
or Rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right

commitments, understandings, or arrangements relating to SCBs rights to vote
or to dispose of such securities and (F) all the Equity Securities of SCBs

(except for assessments required under the CFC with respect to Security Banks
capital stock) and are owned by SCB or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any
Liens. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to

and is in good standing, in each case under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in the jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have nor reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCB. Each of SCBs
Subsidiaries has in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental
authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

(iv) The deposit accounts of Security Bank are insured by the FDIC in the

SCB Board and Security Bank Board on or prior to the date hereof and the SCB
Board has recommended that shareholders of SCB adopt this Agreement and
directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by SCBs shareholders
at the SCB Meeting required by Section 6.02. SCB has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by PPBI, this Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of
SCB, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be

fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles).

 



 

(f) _Regulatory Approvals; No Defaults_.

 



 

(i) No consents or approvals of, or waivers by, or notices to, or filings or
registrations with, any Governmental Authority or with any third party are
required to be made or obtained by SCB or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by SCB of this
Agreement and by Security Bank of the Bank Merger Agreement, or to consummate

and filings referred to in the preceding paragraph and the expiration of
related waiting periods, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by SCB and the Bank Merger Agreement by Security Bank and the

violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration
of remedies or any right of termination under, any law, code, ordinance, rule
or regulation or any judgment, decree, injunction, order, governmental permit
or license, or agreement, indenture or instrument of SCB or any of its
Subsidiaries or to which SCB or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets or properties is subject or bound, (B) constitute a

(g) _Financial Reports; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal Controls_.

 



 

(i) Each of the consolidated balance sheets contained in the SCB Financial
Statements fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial
position of SCB and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash
flows in such SCB Financial Statements fairly presents, or will fairly
present, the consolidated results of operations, shareholders equity and cash

material liability (whether absolute, contingent or accrued or otherwise and
whether due or to become due) that would be required to be reflected on a
balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than
liabilities (A) incurred after June 30, 2015 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or (B) incurred pursuant to or provided
for in this Agreement and, to SCBs Knowledge, there is no existing condition,
event or circumstance as of the date hereof which could result in any such

Schedule, neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken nor permitted or

Effect with respect to SCB.

 



 

(v) No agreement pursuant to which any Loans or other assets have been or
shall be sold by SCB or its Subsidiaries entitled the buyer of such Loans or
other assets, unless there is material breach of a representation or covenant
by SCB or its Subsidiaries, to cause SCB or its Subsidiaries to repurchase
such Loan or other asset or the buyer to pursue any other form of recourse
against SCB or its Subsidiaries. Section 5.03(g)(v) of SCBs Disclosure

distribution with respect to the capital stock of SCB or its Subsidiaries that
has been declared, set aside or paid since December 31, 2011, as well as all

(vi) The records, systems, controls, data and information of SCB and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of SCB or its Subsidiaries (either directly or through SCBs third party data
processing service provider) or its accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this
Section 5.03(g)(vi). SCB (A) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to SCB and its
Subsidiaries is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of SCB by others within SCB or its Subsidiaries and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
SCBs outside auditors and the audit committee of the SCB Board (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect SCBs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in SCBs
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to SCBs auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to PPBI.

 



 

(vii) Since January 1, 2012, (A) neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that SCB or any of its
Subsidiaries, has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (B) no attorney representing SCB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by SCB or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by SCB or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to the SCB Board or any committee thereof or,
to the Knowledge of SCB, to any director or officer of SCB or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) _Legal Proceedings_. No litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding
before any court or Governmental Authority is pending against SCB or any of
its Subsidiaries and, to SCBs Knowledge, no such litigation, arbitration,
claim or other proceeding has been threatened and there are no facts which
could reasonably give rise to such litigation, arbitration, claim or other
proceeding. Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective properties is a party to or subject to any order, judgment, decree
or regulatory restriction that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
SCB.

with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, and SCB has
previously delivered or made available to PPBI accurate and complete copies of
all such reports. In connection with the most recent examination of SCB and
its Subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory authorities, neither SCB nor
any of its Subsidiaries was required to correct or change any action,
procedure or proceeding which SCB believes in good faith has not been now
corrected or changed, other than corrections or changes which, if not made,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on SCB.

 



 

(ii) Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a

procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any
Governmental Authority. SCB and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments
made or imposed by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(iii) Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been advised by, nor does it
have any Knowledge of facts which could give rise to an advisory notice by,
any Governmental Authority that such Governmental Authority is contemplating
issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or
requesting) any such order, decree, directive, agreement, memorandum of
understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission or
any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure or board resolution.

 



 

(iv) (A) No Governmental Authority has initiated since December 31, 2011 or
has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the Knowledge of SCB,
investigation or inquiry into the business, operations, policies, practices or
disclosures of SCB or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations
conducted by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary course of the business
of SCB and its Subsidiaries), or, to the Knowledge of SCB, threatened any of
the foregoing, and (B) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment or
exception by any Governmental Authority with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of SCB or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(v) The most recent regulatory rating given to Security Bank as to compliance
with the Community Reinvestment Act is "satisfactory." To the Knowledge of

Community Reinvestment Act compliance, Security Bank has not received any
complaints as to Community Reinvestment Act compliance.

directors, officers, employees, or with regards to the provision of services
similar to those provided by an employee, independent contractors or

Transaction) or which requires exclusive referrals of business or requires SCB
or any of its Subsidiaries to offer specified products or services to its
customers or depositors on a priority or exclusive basis, or (O) which is with
respect to, or otherwise commits SCB or any of its Subsidiaries to do, any of
the foregoing (collectively, "Material Contracts"). Except as set forth in
Section 5.03(k)(i) of SCBs Disclosure Schedule, no consents, approvals,
notices or waivers are required to be obtained or delivered pursuant to the
terms and conditions of any Material Contract as a result of SCBs and
Security Banks (as applicable) execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement and the consummation of the

transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles). SCB and its Subsidiaries

right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any Material Contract, or
(C) give any Person the right to cancel, terminate or modify any Material

under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 4141 of the Code (collectively,
the "Benefit Plans"), are set forth in Section 5.03(m)(i) of SCBs Disclosure
Schedule. True and complete copies of the following documents have been
provided or made available to PPBI: (A) all Benefit Plans including, but not
limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts entered into in
connection with any Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto; (B) the three
most recent annual report (Form 5500), together with all schedules, as
required, filed with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or Department of
Labor (the "DOL"), as applicable, and any financial statements and opinions
required by Section 103(e)(3) of ERISA with respect to each Benefit Plan; (C)
for each Benefit Plan which is a "top-hat" plan, a copy of filings with the

(ii) Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all documents,
contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is maintained. No
act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with respect to any
Benefit Plan that would subject SCB or any of its Subsidiaries to any fine,
penalty, Tax or liability of any kind imposed under ERISA, the Code or other
applicable law following the Closing. Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension
Plan") and which is

 



      
 

 



 

intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter, or advisory or opinion letter, as applicable,
from the IRS, and SCB has no Knowledge of any circumstances likely to result
in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the
qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither
SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or written or
verbal notice from the IRS, DOL, any other Governmental Authority, any
participant in or beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing
any of the foregoing that brings into question the qualification of any such
Benefit Plan. There is no material pending or, to SCBs Knowledge, threatened
litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither SCB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan
that could subject SCB or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount
which would be material. There are no matters pending before the IRS, DOL or
other Governmental Authority with respect to any Benefit Plan. No Benefit Plan
or related trust has been the subject of an audit, investigation or
examination by a Governmental Authority.

 



 

(iii) Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any
Pension Plan, a multiple employer plan (as defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code) or multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) other than
those disclosed and identified as such in Section 5.03(m)(iii) of SCBs
Disclosure Schedule. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by SCB or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by it or the
single-employer plan of any entity which is considered a single employer with
SCB under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate"). Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and neither
expects to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer
plan under Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of
an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA
Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection with the Transaction.
There has been no termination, or partial termination, under Section 411(d)(3)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, of any Pension Plan. All ERISA
Affiliates of SCB are set forth (and designated as an ERISA Affiliate in
Section 5.03(m)(iii) of SCBs Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
have been timely made or have been reflected in the SCB Financial Statements.
Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any "unpaid minimum required contribution" within the meaning of
Section 4971(c) of the Code and no multiemployer plan has incurred an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 4971(c) of the Code. SCB and each of its ERISA Affiliates have met all
applicable minimum funding requirements under Sections 412 and 430 of the Code
and Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA in respect of each Pension Plan and
multiemployer plan. None of SCB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have an
outstanding funding waiver. The benefit liability, as defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA, of any Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, using
the actuarial assumptions that would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") in the event such Pension Plan is terminated, does not
exceed the fair market value of the assets of each such plan. The liabilities
of each terminated Pension Plan have been fully discharged in full compliance
with applicable laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Neither SCB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have any obligations under a
Retiree Welfare Plan. SCB or any of its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate
any such Retiree Welfare Plan in accordance with and to the extent permitted
by its terms at any time without incurring any liability thereunder. No event
or condition exists with respect to a Benefit Plan that could subject SCB to a
material Tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

 



 

(vi) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(vi) of SCBs Disclosure Schedule,

director or independent contractor of SCB or any ERISA Affiliate to severance
pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment or
service after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable under, or trigger
any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Benefit
Plans or (D) result in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither SCB nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any liability or is a party with respect to any gross-up provision or
agreement in connection with Section 280 of the Code or excise Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(vii) All required reports and descriptions (including but not limited to Form
5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual
reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions) have been filed or
distributed appropriately with respect to each Benefit Plan. All required Tax
filings with respect to each Benefit Plan have been made, and any Taxes due in
connection with such filings have been paid.

 



 

(viii) Neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has now, nor has had, the
obligation to maintain, establish, sponsor, participate in or contribute to
any Benefit Plan or other similar arrangement that is subject to any law or
applicable custom or rule of any jurisdiction outside of the United States.

a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of Section
419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the
meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 



 

(x) Each Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) (hereinafter referred to as
an "SCB NQDP") has been maintained, as to both form and operation, in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code. No event in connection with an SCB
NQDP has occurred which would subject a participant to inclusion of income
under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code and neither SCB nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any liability or is a party with respect to any gross-up provision or
agreement in connection with any income inclusion, interest or additional Tax
payable in accordance with Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(xi) No contributions pursuant to a Benefit Plan have been made by SCB or any
of its Subsidiaries in such amounts that would violate Section 404 of the
Code.

 



 

(xii) SCB and each of its Subsidiaries have in force sufficient bonding for
every fiduciary who is or has been required to be bonded with respect to the
Benefit Plans, or where the fiduciary is not an employee or director of SCB,
SCB has ensured that such fiduciary is covered by a bond that complies with
Section 412 of ERISA. There does not exist any pending or, to SCBs Knowledge,
threatened legal proceedings (other than routine claims for benefits),
arbitrations, administrative or other proceeding with respect to any Benefit
Plan or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder or with respect
to SCB and each of its Subsidiaries as the sponsor or fiduciary thereof, or to
SCBs Knowledge, with respect to any other fiduciary thereof.

 



 

(xiii) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(xiii) of SCBs Disclosure
Schedule, each Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without the consent
of participants and without the imposition of any additional liability or
penalties upon SCB or any ERISA Affiliate. The sponsor of each benefit Plan,
including, without limitation SCB, has reserved in itself the authority and
discretion to amend or terminate each Benefit Plan and has provided disclosure
of such right to each participant and beneficiary (including any potential
participants and beneficiaries) of each Benefit Plan.

or change any action, procedure or proceeding which PPBI believes in good
faith has not now been corrected or changed, other than corrections or changes
which, if not made, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a

procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any
Governmental Authority. PPBI and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments
made or imposed by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(iii) Neither PPBI nor any its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and does not
have any Knowledge of facts which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
an advisory notice by, any Governmental Authority that such Governmental
Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter
or similar submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure
or board resolution.

conducted by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary course of the business
of PPBI or the applicable Subsidiary), or, to PPBIs Knowledge, threatened any
of the foregoing, and (B) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment
or exception by any Governmental Authority with respect to any report or

Subsidiaries, except in each case in subparagraphs (A) and (B), that did not

at 12 CFR §225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of its primary federal bank
regulator) and the rating of Pacific Premier under the CRA is no less than
"satisfactory." Neither PPBI nor Pacific Premier has received any
notification from a Governmental Authority that their status as "well-
capitalized" or "satisfactory" for CRA purposes will change within one year,

result in a CRA rating of less than "satisfactory" or material criticism from

terms are defined under the Exchange Act), owns beneficially or of record,
directly or indirectly, or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of,
shares of SCB Common Stock (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity
that are beneficially owned by third parties or as a result of debts
previously contracted).

 



 

(m) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2014, except as
specifically contemplated by or as disclosed in this Agreement or otherwise
disclosed in PPBIs public filings with the SEC, there has not been any

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **COVENANTS**

 



 

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of SCB and PPBI agrees to use its reasonable best efforts in
good faith, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their reasonable
best efforts in good faith, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or
advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the
Transaction as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of
the Transaction, including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof, and shall cooperate fully with the other party hereto to
that end.

 



 

6.02 _Shareholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) SCB agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the SCB Articles
and the SCB Bylaws, all action necessary to convene as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective, a special
meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of this
Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by SCBs shareholders
for consummation of the Transaction (including any adjournment or
postponement, the "SCB Meeting"). Except with the prior approval of PPBI, no
other matters shall be submitted for the approval of the SCB shareholders at
the SCB Meeting. Subject to Section 6.02(b), the SCB Board shall at all times
prior to and during such meeting recommend such approval and shall take all
reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its shareholders and
shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to PPBI such
recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement
in connection with the SCB Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation
(collectively, a "Change in Recommendation"), except as and to the extent
permitted by Section 6.02(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of SCB at the SCB
Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved by SCBs shareholders for consummation of the
Transaction. In addition to the foregoing, SCB shall not submit to the vote of
its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, SCB and the SCB Board shall be permitted to
effect a Change in Recommendation if and only to the extent that:

 



 

(i) SCB shall have complied in all material respects with Section 6.07;

 



 

(ii) the SCB Board, based on advice of its outside counsel, shall have
determined in good faith that failure to do so would result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

 



 

(iii) if the SCB Board intends to effect a Change in Recommendation following
an Acquisition Proposal, (A) the SCB Board shall have concluded in good faith,
after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by PPBI
pursuant to clause (C) below, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) SCB shall notify

 



      
 

 



 

PPBI, at least five Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a
Change in Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to PPBI a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and all other material documents, and (C) prior to
effecting such a Change in Recommendation, SCB shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the period following SCBs delivery of
the notice referred to in clause (B) above, negotiate with PPBI in good faith
for a period of up to five Business Days (to the extent PPBI desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(c) PPBI agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the PPBI
Certificate and PPBI Bylaws, all action necessary to convene as soon as
reasonably practicable a meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon
the approval of the issuance of the PPBI Common Stock in the Merger and any
other matters required to be approved by PPBIs shareholders for consummation
of the Transaction (including any adjournment or postponement, the "PPBI
Meeting"). The PPBI Board shall at all times prior to and during the PPBI
Meeting recommend approval of the issuance of the PPBI Common Stock in the
Merger and any other matters required to be approved by PPBIs shareholders
for consummation of the transaction and shall take all reasonable lawful
action to solicit such approval by its shareholders.

 



 

6.03 _Registration Statement_.

 



 

(a) PPBI agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other
applicable form (the "Registration Statement") to be filed by PPBI with the
SEC in connection with the issuance of the shares of PPBI Common Stock to the
SCB shareholders as part of the Merger Consideration in the Merger (including
the joint proxy statement for the PPBI Meeting and the SCB Meeting and
prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of PPBI and SCB constituting
a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related documents). SCB shall
prepare and furnish such information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably
required in connection with the above referenced documents based on its
knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and
SCB, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to
review in advance such Registration Statement prior to its filing. SCB agrees
to cooperate with PPBI and PPBIs counsel and accountants in requesting and
obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial
advisor and independent auditor in connection with the Registration Statement
and the Proxy Statement. Provided that SCB has cooperated as described above,
PPBI shall use its best efforts to file, or cause to be filed, the
Registration Statement with the SEC within thirty (30) days of the date of
this Agreement or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Each of
SCB and PPBI agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. PPBI also agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities
law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, SCB and PPBI shall promptly mail at its
expense the Proxy Statement to all of their respective shareholders.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of SCB and PPBI agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to SCBs and
PPBIs respective shareholders and at the time(s) of the SCB Meeting and the
PPBI Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. Each of SCB and PPBI further agrees that if
such party shall become aware prior to the date of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement of any information furnished by such party that would
cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
false or misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take
the necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement.

 



 

(c) PPBI agrees to advise SCB, promptly after PPBI receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of PPBI Common Stock for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent PPBI is aware
thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by
the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

 



 

6.04 _Regulatory Filings_.

 



 

(a) Each of PPBI and SCB and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the Transaction; and PPBI shall use its best efforts to make any
initial application filings with Governmental Authorities within thirty (30)
days of the date of this Agreement or as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter. Each of PPBI and SCB shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction, provided that PPBI
shall not be required to provide SCB with confidential portions of any filing
with a Governmental Authority. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such
parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other parties hereto with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the Transaction, and each party shall keep the other
parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of
the Transaction. Each party hereto further agrees to provide the other parties
with a copy of all correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transaction, provided that PPBI shall not be required to
provide SCB with confidential portions of any filing with a Governmental
Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other parties or any of their Subsidiaries to any third party
or Governmental Authority.

 



 

6.05 _Press Releases_. SCB and PPBI shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release with respect to the Transaction or this Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statements
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that PPBI may, without the prior consent of SCB
(but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or
regulations of the SEC or Nasdaq. SCB and PPBI shall cooperate to develop all
public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the Transaction as reasonably requested by the other
party.

 



 

6.06 _Access; Information_.

 



 

(a) SCB agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford PPBI and Pacific
Premiers officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), systems,
properties, personnel and advisors of SCB and its Subsidiaries and to such
other information relating to SCB and its Subsidiaries as PPBI may reasonably
request and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to PPBI (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
banking, lending, securities, consumer finance or privacy laws and (ii) all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of SCB and
its Subsidiaries as PPBI may reasonably request.

 



 

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
SCB shall, upon the request of PPBI, cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of PPBI regarding its consolidated financial condition,
operations and business and matters relating to the completion of the
Transaction. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than 15
days after the end of each calendar quarter ending after the date of this
Agreement (other than the last quarter of each fiscal year ending December
31), SCB will deliver to PPBI its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity
and cash flows, without related notes, for such quarter prepared in accordance
with GAAP, and, as soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than 30
days after the end of each fiscal year, SCB will deliver to PPBI its
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for such year
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within 15 days after the end of each month,
SCB will deliver to PPBI a consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statements of income, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be subject
to the provisions of the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement,
dated as of May 13, 2015 by and between PPBI, Pacific Premier, SCB and
Security Bank (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 



 

(d) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

 



 

6.07 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) SCB agrees that it shall, and shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be
ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), and will use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly return or
destroy any confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of
SCB or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder and by specifically enforcing the
terms thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. From the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, neither SCB nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and shall cause their respective directors, officers or employees or
any Representative retained by them not to, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to
facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill" or similar obligations of any Person other than PPBI or its
Affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or
propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that prior to the date of the SCB Meeting, if the SCB Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal and
financial advisors, that the failure to do so would breach, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, the SCB Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable law, SCB may, in response to a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 6.07(a) that
the SCB Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), subject to providing 48 hour prior written notice of its
decision to take such action to PPBI and identifying the Person making the
proposal and all the material terms and conditions of such proposal and
compliance with Section 6.07(b), (1) furnish information with respect to
itself to any Person making such a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined by SCB after consultation with its
outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such Person than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to PPBI, and

 



       
 

 



 

(2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any of the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10% or more of the
total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of SCB and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class
of Equity Securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of SCB or
Security Bank, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of Equity
Securities of SCB or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
SCB, other than the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of SCB Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of SCBs consolidated assets, which
the SCB Board determines in good faith, after taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to consummation), and after taking into account the advice of
SCBs financial advisor (which shall be a recognized investment banking firm)
and outside counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to
its shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated
on the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the SCB Board, is
reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party.

 



 

(b) In addition to the obligations of SCB set forth in Section 6.07(a), SCB
shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise PPBI orally and in writing of its
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and keep PPBI informed, on a
current basis, of the continuing status thereof, including the terms and
conditions thereof and any changes thereto, and shall contemporaneously
provide to PPBI all materials provided to or made available to any third party
pursuant to this Section 6.07 which were not previously provided to PPBI.

 



 

(c) SCB agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.07 by any Representative of SCB or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
a breach of this Section 6.07 by SCB.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.07(a) were violated by SCB, its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of SCB or its Subsidiaries. It is
accordingly agreed that PPBI shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of Section 6.07 and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which PPBI is
entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys fees or other costs are
incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations herein provided for,
or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other
appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, PPBI shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred therein.

 



      
 

 



 

6.08 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, upon the request of
PPBI, SCB shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and
applicable banking laws and regulations, use their reasonable best efforts to
modify or change their Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with
that of PPBI; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be
made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b);
and further provided that in any event, no such modification or change made by
SCB or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall constitute
or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of SCB or its management with any such adjustments.

 



 

6.09 _Nasdaq Listing_. PPBI shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq
the shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued to the SCB shareholders as the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger.

 



 

6.10 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, PPBI (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of SCB or a
SCB Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she
was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of SCB or any SCB
Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of SCB or any SCB Subsidiary as
a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without
limitation, matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement or consummation of the Transaction, to the fullest extent which
such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the SCB Articles and the SCB
Bylaws or any agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been set forth
in Section 6.10 of SCBs Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not

 



      
 

 



 

actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and
regulations.

 



 

(c) PPBI shall maintain SCBs existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy (or provide a policy providing comparable coverage and
amounts on terms no less favorable to the persons currently covered by SCBs
existing policy, including PPBIs existing policy if it meets the foregoing
standard) covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in
no event shall PPBI be obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide
insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), an amount in excess of
200% of the annual premiums paid by SCB as of the date hereof for such
insurance ("Maximum Insurance Amount"); provided further, that if the amount
of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, PPBI shall obtain the most
advantageous coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Insurance Amount.

 



 

(d) If PPBI or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of PPBI shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

 



 

6.11 _Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, PPBI
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of SCB and its Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement of PPBI and Pacific Premier of general applicability (the "PPBI
Benefit Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of PPBI and
its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of SCB
and its Subsidiaries in the PPBI Benefit Plans may occur at different times
with respect to different plans), provided that coverage shall be continued
under the corresponding Benefit Plans of SCB and its Subsidiaries until such
employees are permitted to participate in the PPBI Benefit

 



      
 

 



 

Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained herein shall
require PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former
employee of SCB and its Subsidiaries under any discretionary equity
compensation plan of PPBI. PPBI shall cause each PPBI Benefit Plan in which
employees of SCB and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to
recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the
vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not for accrual of pension
benefits) under the PPBI Benefit Plans, the service of such employees with SCB
and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such
purpose by SCB and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of PPBI to
amend or terminate any of the PPBI Benefit Plans or the SCB Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms at any time.

 



 

(b) At and following the Effective Time, PPBI shall honor, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current
and former employees of SCB and its Subsidiaries and current and former
directors of SCB and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as
well as all bonus, deferred compensation or other existing plans and policies
of SCB and its Subsidiaries to the extent that each of the foregoing are
Previously Disclosed. The severance or termination payments which are payable
pursuant to such agreements, plans or policies of SCB (which have been
quantified in reasonable detail) have been Previously Disclosed. The current
and former SCB directors or executive officers participating in any SCB
deferred compensation plan, supplemental employee retirement plan or other
deferred compensation arrangement as of and/or after the Effective Time who
enter into a release agreement with PPBI no later than the Effective Time will
receive the payments that he or she is entitled to receive under such plan as
of and/or after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such
release agreement; provided that such release agreement shall not change the
time and form of payment due under the plan or arrangement in a manner that
would violate Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(c) At such time as employees of SCB and its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of PPBI or its Subsidiaries,
PPBI shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable
medical, health or dental plans of PPBI, (ii) provide full credit under such
plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year
prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to
such employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding SCB
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Those employees of SCB and its Subsidiaries who are not offered employment
by PPBI or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, who are not a party
to an employment agreement or otherwise entitled to an existing severance
package and who sign and deliver a termination and release agreement (which
will be negotiated between PPBI and SCB) within 30 days of the Effective Time
shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum payment of severance equal to
two weeks of salary for each year of service (with a prorated amount of
payment for partial years), up to a maximum of 13 weeks. Such payments will be
made by PPBI

 



      
 

 



 

on the date the termination and release agreement that is executed by an
employee becomes effective, which date shall be in the sole discretion of
PPBI. If SCB or any of its Subsidiaries also has a severance pay plan, then
any amounts paid pursuant to that plan shall reduce the amount that the
employee will receive under this Section 6.11(d) and in no event shall there
be any duplication of severance pay. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11(d)
hereof shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way PPBIs
or its Subsidiaries at will employment policy or provide any third party
beneficiary rights to employees of SCB or any of its Subsidiaries. In no event
shall severance pay be taken into account in determining the amount of any
other benefit (including but not limited to, an individuals benefit under any
retirement plan or policy). If, by reason of the controlling plan document,
controlling law or otherwise, severance pay is taken into account in
determining any other benefit, the severance pay otherwise payable shall be
reduced by the present value of the additional benefit determined under other
benefit plans attributable to the severance pay period.

 



 

(e) Each of SCB and PPBI acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained
within this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees are included for the sole
benefit of SCB and nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.11. Nothing contained herein (i) shall be construed
to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of PPBI to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program or arrangement at any time established, sponsored or maintained
by PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of SCB and PPBI agrees that the terms
of this Section 6.11 do not and shall not create any right in any Person to
continued employment with SCB, PPBI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
to any compensation or benefit.

 



 

6.12 _Appointment of Directors_. PPBI agrees to take all action necessary to
appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, two individuals, each of
whom shall be mutually agreeable to PPBI and SCB, as directors of PPBI and
Pacific Premier. Each individual shall serve until the first annual meeting of
stockholders of PPBI following the Effective Time and until his successor is
elected and qualified. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the PPBI Board, PPBI
shall include such individuals on the list of nominees for director presented
by the PPBI Board and for which the PPBI Board shall solicit proxies at the
first annual meeting of stockholders of PPBI following the Effective Time.

 



 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of SCB and PPBI shall give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events
and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

 



 

6.14 _Estoppel Letters_. SCB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to PPBI at the Closing with respect to the real estate (i)
owned by SCB or an SCB Subsidiary, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing
in substantially the form of Annex D from all tenants and (ii) leased by SCB
or a SCB Subsidiary, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in
substantially the form of Annex E from its lessor.

 



      
 

 



 

6.15 _Redemption of SCB SBLF Preferred Stock_. SCB and PPBI each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause or facilitate the redemption, as of
immediately prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, of each share of
SCB SBLF Preferred Stock issued and outstanding in such amount as shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of the SCB SBLF Preferred Stock set
forth in the SCB Articles and the terms of any securities purchase agreement
entered into by SCB in connection with the issuance of the SCB SBLF Preferred
Stock and/or such other agreements required to be entered into by and between
SCB and the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury") (or any
other holder) in order to effect such redemption (the "SBLF Redemption"). PPBI
or Pacific Premier will fund the SBLF Redemption. The method of funding of
such SBLF Redemption shall be mutually agreed to by SCB and PPBI, subject to
any formal or informal Treasury requirements and the required approval of any
Governmental Authorities. In furtherance of the foregoing, SCB shall provide,
and shall cause its officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
to provide, all reasonable cooperation and take all reasonable actions as may
be requested by PPBI in connection with such SBLF Redemption, including by (i)
furnishing all information concerning SCB and its Subsidiaries that PPBI or
any applicable Governmental Authority may request in connection with such
redemption or with respect to the effects of such SBLF Redemption on PPBI or
its pro forma capitalization; (ii) assisting with the preparation of any
analyses or presentations PPBI deems necessary or advisable in its reasonable
judgment in connection with such redemption or the effects thereof; and (iii)
entering into any agreement with the Treasury or any other holder of the SCB
SBLF Preferred Stock to effect the redemption of such shares as PPBI may
reasonably request. Such SCB SBLF Preferred Stock shall, at the Effective
Time, cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be cancelled
as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor. Alternatively, PPBI may, in its sole
discretion, in lieu of the SBLF Redemption, immediately prior to or
concurrently with the Effective Time, issue shares of its preferred stock (or
have Pacific Premier issues shares of its preferred stock) to the Treasury
similar to and in exchange for the SCB SBLF Preferred Stock and assume the
rights and obligations of the SCB SBLF Preferred Stock upon consummation of
the Transaction pursuant to the terms of the SCB SBLF Preferred Stock set
forth in the SCB Articles.

 



 

6.16 _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of PPBI and SCB and their respective Boards
of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction, take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the
Transaction.

 



 

6.17 _Consents_. SCB shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, waivers, non-objections and to
deliver any notices required pursuant to the terms of the Material Contracts
as a result of the Transaction.

SCB set forth in this Agreement, subject in all cases to the standard set
forth in Section 5.02, shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and as
of the Effective Date as though made on and as of the Effective Date (except
that representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of the date
hereof or some other date shall be true and correct as of such date), and PPBI
shall have received a certificate, dated the Effective Date, signed on behalf
of SCB by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of SCB

be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) _Mutual Consent_. By the mutual consent in writing of PPBI and SCB.

 



 

(b) _Breach_. Provided that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, by PPBI or SCB in the event of a breach by the other party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, which breach
(i) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to the breaching party of such breach and (ii) would entitle the non-
breaching party not to consummate the Transaction contemplated hereby under
Section 7.02(a) or (b) or 7.03(a) or (b), as the case may be.

 



 

(c) _Delay_. By PPBI or SCB in the event the Merger is not consummated by June
30, 2016, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be
consummated by such date shall be due to (i) the failure of the party seeking
to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the
failure of any of the Shareholders (if SCB is the party seeking to terminate)
to perform or observe their respective covenants and agreements under the
relevant Shareholder Agreement.

 



 

(d) _No Regulatory Approval_. By PPBI or SCB in the event the approval of any
Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final
nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or an application therefor
shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a Governmental
Authority, provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if such denial shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants of such party set forth herein.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _No SCB Shareholder Approval_. By PPBI if the approval of the shareholders
of SCB contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason
of the failure to obtain the required vote at the SCB Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

 



 

(f) _SCB Failure to Recommend; Etc._ By PPBI if (i) SCB shall have materially
breached the provisions of Section 6.07 in any respect adverse to PPBI, (ii)
the SCB Board shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to in
Section 6.02, withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such
recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of PPBI, or
(iii) SCB shall have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02 by
failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the SCB Meeting in
accordance with Section 6.02.

 



 

(g) _No PPBI Shareholder Approval_. By SCB if the approval of the shareholders
of PPBI contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason
of the failure to obtain the required vote at the PPBI meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

 



 

(h) _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By PPBI if a tender offer or exchange
offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of SCB Common Stock is
commenced (other than by PPBI or a Subsidiary thereof), and the SCB Board
recommends that the shareholders of SCB tender their shares in such tender or
exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject
such tender offer or exchange offer.

 



 

8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have
any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except that
(i) this Section 8.02, Section 6.06(c) and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, neither PPBI nor SCB shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that SCB shall pay PPBI the sum of $4.5 million
(the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

 



 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by PPBI pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or
(h), SCB shall pay the entire Termination Fee to PPBI on the second Business
Day following the termination of this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by (A) PPBI pursuant to Section 8.01(b),
(B) by either PPBI or SCB pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and at the time of such
termination no vote of the SCB shareholders contemplated by this Agreement at
the SCB Meeting shall have occurred, or (C) by PPBI pursuant to Section
8.01(e), and in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or
(C), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly

 



       
 

 



 

announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the senior management of
SCB or the SCB Board (or any Person shall have publicly announced,
communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make
an Acquisition Proposal, or reiterated a previously expressed plan or
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of SCB
contemplated by this Agreement at the SCB Meeting, in the case of clause (C),
or the date of termination, in the case of clause (A) or (B), then (1) if
within 12 months after such termination SCB enters into an agreement with
respect to a Control Transaction, then SCB shall pay to PPBI an amount equal
to $3.0 million on the date of execution of such agreement and upon
consummation of any such Control Transaction at any time thereafter, SCB shall
pay to PPBI the remainder of the Termination Fee on the date of such
consummation and (2) if a Control Transaction is consummated otherwise than
pursuant to an agreement with SCB within 15 months after such termination,
then SCB shall pay to PPBI the Termination Fee (less any amount previously
paid by SCB pursuant to clause (1) above) on the date of such consummation of
such Control Transaction. As used in this Section 8.02(b), a "Control
Transaction" means (i) the acquisition by any Person whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation, sale, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any
series of transactions, of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
securities of SCB or Security Bank or a majority of the assets of SCB or
Security Bank, (ii) any issuance of securities resulting in the ownership by
any Person of more than 50% of the voting power of SCB or by any Person other
than SCB or its Subsidiaries of more than 50% of the voting power of Security
Bank or (iii) any merger, consolidation or other business combination
transaction involving SCB or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of which the
shareholders of SCB cease to own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the total
voting power of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction.

 



 

Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
PPBI.

 



 

(c) SCB and PPBI agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) above is
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without such agreement PPBI would not have entered into this Agreement, and
that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by SCB. If SCB fails to pay PPBI the
amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified in
such paragraph (b), SCB shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred by PPBI in connection with any action,
including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts,
provided PPBI prevails on the merits, together with interest on the amount of
any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

9.01 _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than
agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to be
performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(c), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination).
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations,
warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a party hereto or any
of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which otherwise would be
available against the claims of any Person, including without limitation any
shareholder or former shareholder.

 



 

9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)
amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing among the parties
hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except that after the
approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the SCB shareholders, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the
shareholders of SCB without obtaining such approval. For purposes of
clarification, an amendment of any date in Section 8.01(c) shall not require
further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment were deemed by law
to require further approval by the shareholders of SCB, the approval of the
principal terms of this Agreement by the SCB shareholders will be deemed to
have granted SCB the authority to amend such dates without such further
approval.

 



 

9.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

 



 

9.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
made and to be performed entirely within such State.

 



 

9.05 _Expenses_. Each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and
counsel; provided that nothing contained herein shall limit either partys
rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other partys
fraud or breach of any provision of this Agreement; provided further that, if
(i) the FIS Expense, which shall be confirmed in writing from FIS prior to
Closing, exceeds the FIS Expense Cap, and/or (ii) the Deal Expenses, which are
set forth in Section 9.05 of SCBs Disclosure Schedule, exceed the Deal
Expenses Cap (the aggregate of any excess of FIS Expense over the FIS Expense
Cap and any excess of Deal Expenses over the Deal Expenses Cap being referred
to as "Excess Expenses"), then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted such that
the as-adjusted Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the product resulting when
(A) 0.9629 is multiplied by (B) the quotient resulting when (i) $113,221,955
less the Excess Expenses, is divided by (ii) $113,221,955, such product
rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the FIS Expense may exceed the FIS Expense Cap without
resulting in an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence so long as, and only to the extent that, the
aggregate of the FIS Expense and Deal Expenses do not exceed $8.25 million
(with any excess over $8.25 million resulting in an adjustment as described in
the immediately preceding sentence).

 



      
 

 



 

9.06 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,
telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) or delivered by an overnight courier (with
confirmation) to such party at its address set forth below or such other
address as such party may specify by notice to the parties hereto.

9.07 _Entire Understanding; Limited Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, and the Confidentiality
Agreement supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made. Except for the Indemnified Parties right to enforce PPBIs obligation
under Section 6.10, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on SCB or PPBI, any term or
provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar
as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys fees
or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations
herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to
obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees
and costs incurred therein.

 



      
 

 



 

9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first
above written.

 



 

9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.12 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, PPBI may at any time modify the structure of the acquisition

 **SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT** (the "Agreement"), dated as of September 30, 2015,
among , a shareholder ("Shareholder") of Security California
Bancorp, a California corporation ("SCB"), Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PPBI"), and, solely for purposes of the last sentence
of Section 9, SCB. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , SCB and PPBI are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant
to which SCB will merge with and into PPBI on the terms and conditions set
forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection therewith, outstanding shares
of SCB Common Stock will be converted into shares of PPBI Common Stock in the
manner set forth therein; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Shareholder owns the shares of SCB Common Stock identified on
Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of SCB Common Stock
subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being
referred to as the "Shares"); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in order to induce PPBI to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of SCB and
not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this
Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , for good and valuable consideration, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees while this Agreement is in effect, that at any meeting of the shareholders of SCB, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of SCB, Shareholder shall:

 



 

(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

 



 

(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written
consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder
or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or
direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger, the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (y) against any
action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of
any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement
of SCB contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this
Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action,
agreement or transaction that is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to
materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone,
discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the Merger or
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

2. _Transfer of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions_. Shareholder hereby
agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder shall not, (i)
sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, distribute by gift or donation, or otherwise
dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) or any interest therein, whether by
actual disposition, physical settlement or effective economic disposition
through hedging transactions, derivative instruments or other means, (ii)
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person, or
take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or could reasonably be
expected to violate or conflict with Shareholders representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) take any
other action that could reasonably be expected to impair or otherwise
adversely affect, in any material respect, Shareholders power, authority and
ability to comply with and perform his, her or its covenants and obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees that Shareholder
shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into
any voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to any
of the Shares.

 



 

3. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with PPBI as follows:

 



 

(a) _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter
into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Shareholder and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 



 

(c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder.

 



 

(d) _Ownership_. Shareholders Shares are, and through the term of this
Agreement will be, owned beneficially and of record solely by Shareholder,
except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. Shareholder has good and
indefeasible title to the Shares, free and clear of any lien, pledge,
mortgage, security interest or other encumbrance, except as otherwise
disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. As of the date hereof,

 



      
 

 



 

the Shares identified on Exhibit I hereto constitute all of the shares of SCB
Common Stock owned beneficially or of record by Shareholder. Shareholder has
and will have at all times during the term of this Agreement (i) sole voting
power and sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 1 hereof, (ii) sole power of disposition and (iii) sole power
to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with
respect to all of the Shares owned by Shareholder on the date of this
Agreement and all of the Shares hereafter acquired by Shareholder and owned
beneficially or of record by him, her or it during the term of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be
interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, _provided_
that a Person shall be deemed to beneficially own any securities which may be
acquired by such Person pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,
warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to
acquire such securities is exercisable immediately or only after the passage
of time, including the passage of time within 60 days, the satisfaction of any
conditions, the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing).

 



 

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by him, her or it of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Shareholder to obtain any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(f) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or
affecting Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially impair
the ability of Shareholder to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

 



 

4. _No Solicitation_. Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement he, she or it shall not, and shall not permit any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any of the actions specified in clauses (i)-(vi) of Section 6.07(a) of the Merger Agreement, (b) agree to release, or release, any Person from any obligation under any existing standstill agreement or arrangement relating to SCB, or (c) participate in, directly or indirectly, a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to the voting of, any shares of SCB Common Stock in connection with any vote or other action on any matter of a type described in Section 1(b), other than to recommend that shareholders of SCB vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than PPBI with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 4\. Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall prevent a Shareholder who is an officer or a member of the SCB Board from discharging his or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as such an officer or director.

 



      
 

 



 

5. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions_. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify PPBI promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional shares of SCB Common Stock or other securities of SCB of which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date hereof. Shareholder will comply with the provisions of Section 6.07(b) of the Merger Agreement as if he, she or it were SCB.

 



 

6. _Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Shareholder agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing Date, the Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, either as
principal, manager, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor,
officer, stockholder, partner, investor, lender or employee or in any other
similar capacity:

 



 

(i) solicit (other than general solicitations through newspapers or other
media of general circulation not targeted at such employees) any employees of
SCB or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing ("SCB Employees"); or

 



 

(ii) (A) induce, persuade, encourage or influence or attempt to induce,
persuade, encourage or influence any Person having a business relationship
with PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, to discontinue, reduce
or restrict such relationship or (B) solicit or target the deposits, loans or
other products and services from or to Persons who were depositors, borrowers
or customers of SCB or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and/or
as of the Closing Date, whether by personal contact, by telephone, by
facsimile, by mail or other form of solicitation or communication, or in any
other way except for general solicitations that are directed to the general
public and not directed specifically to Persons who were depositors, borrowers
or customers of SCB or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, or as
of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for purposes of
clarity, nothing herein shall prohibit the Shareholder from exercising
Shareholders discretion relating to Shareholders personal and business
banking relationships.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by SCB
and its Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants made by the
Shareholder in this Section 6 are made as a necessary inducement for PPBI to
enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of this Section 6 shall be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and
agreed that although the Shareholder and PPBI each consider the restrictions
contained in this Section 6 to be reasonable, if a final determination is made
by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or
territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 6 is
unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 6 shall be
deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such
maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this
Agreement are necessary to protect PPBIs legitimate business interests and to
protect the value of PPBIs acquisition of SCB. The Shareholder warrants that
these provisions will not unreasonably interfere with his or her ability to
earn a living or to pursue his or her occupation and the Shareholder has the
means to support himself or herself and his or her dependents and the
provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any manner
whatsoever.

 



 

(d) The Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred
to in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or
any of its Affiliates, or the business conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates, or any stockholder, member, director, manager,
officer, employee or agent of PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates.

 



 

7. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to PPBI if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, PPBI will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that PPBI may have an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with PPBIs seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

 



 

8. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

 



 

(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Except for the provisions in Section 6, which shall survive for a period
of two (2) years from the Closing Date, this Agreement shall terminate upon
the earlier to occur of (i) the date, if any, of termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (ii) the Effective Time of the
Merger. Upon such termination, except as described above, no party shall have
any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

9. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby authorizes and instructs SCB to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of Shareholders Shares for the period from the date hereof through the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8. SCB agrees that it shall comply with such stop transfer instructions.

 



      
 

 



 

10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 



 

11. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or like transmission and on the next Business Day when sent by a reputable overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):
