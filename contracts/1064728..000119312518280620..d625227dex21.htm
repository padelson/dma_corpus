This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of September 20, 2018 (the "Effective Date") by and between Drummond Company,
Inc., an Alabama corporation ("Seller") and Peabody Southeast Mining, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer", and together with
Seller, collectively, the "Parties" and individually, a "Party"), and, solely
for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 8.21_ hereunder, Peabody Energy Corporation
("Guarantor"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have

WHEREAS, Seller is engaged in (among other things) the Business, and in
connection therewith, Seller owns and/or has the right to use the Purchased
Assets;

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer, all of Sellers rights, title and interest in and to the Purchased
Assets; and

WHEREAS, the respective board of directors or other governing body, as
applicable, of Seller and Buyer have approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, conditions and agreements contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

Section 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of_ _Purchased Assets; Assumption of
Assumed Liabilities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and
convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, all of
Sellers rights, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets, free and

Buyers payment of the Purchase Price as set forth herein, and (b) Buyers
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) Buyer shall assume, be
responsible for and agree to fully discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

 

Section 1.02 _Purchase Price; Payment_. For purposes of this Agreement,

Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.06_. At the
Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (to one or more accounts specified by Seller) an amount equal to (x) the
Base Purchase Price _plus_ or  _minus_ (y) the Closing Adjustment (such net
amount, the "Closing Amount").

or related to the Purchased Assets or Business. All Liabilities of Seller and
any Affiliate of Seller, including those arising from or related to the
Purchased Assets or Business, that are not expressly assumed by Buyer as

without limitation any such Liabilities arising as a result of any Persons
failure on or prior to the Closing Date to comply with the terms of any
Environmental Permit, Mining Permit, bonds related thereto or any Laws,
including Environmental Laws, as applicable to the Sellers (or its

portion thereof;

 

(iv) any Indebtedness;

 

(v) any Liabilities for intercompany obligations between the Seller and any

doctrine of product liability;

 



2

in _Sections 5.07(h)_ , _(i)_ and _(j)_ , any current, former, or
inactive employee or service provider of Seller who becomes a Re-Hired
Employee, but with respect to this clause (B), only with respect to
Liabilities that arise or arise from events that occurred on or prior to
the Closing Date;

(xi) any Liability arising from, based upon, or with respect to any Plan

any Law related to such Plans; including but not limited to: (A) any Liability
arising under COBRA, HIPAA and other similar Laws, including all Liabilities
of a fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or

Taxes arising out of, attributable to or in respect of the Purchased Assets
or Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and

 

(xv) any Liability for advance or minimum royalties, production royalties,

haulage royalties or payments, and any other payments out of or measured by
production ("Royalties"), or other similar obligations for any period on or
prior to the Closing Date with respect to the Purchased Assets or Business,
except that Buyer shall be solely liable for payment of those royalties
related to Coal Inventory included in the Purchased Assets and the sale of
coal by Buyer occurring following the Closing.

Section 1.04 _Excluded Assets_. In no event shall the Purchased Assets
include (nor shall Seller be deemed to sell, assign, transfer or convey to
Buyer) any of the Excluded Assets.

 

Section 1.05 _Pro-Rations_ _._ The following pro-rations shall be made as
of the Closing Date, with Seller liable to the extent that such items relate
to any time period prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer liable to the extent
that such items relate to any time period subsequent to the Closing Date, by
appropriate cash payments of the applicable amounts from Buyer to Seller
and/or from Seller to Buyer, as the case may be, each of which shall be made
reasonably promptly, but in no event later than 30 days, after a written
request therefor, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, is
submitted to Seller by Buyer, or vice-versa as the case may be: (a) water,
electric, sewer and other utilities directly related to the Real
Property included in the Purchased Assets and (b) in conformance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.03(xv)_, Royalties payable under the Leases on sales of coal
under the contracts set forth on _Schedule 1.05_. Taxes shall be prorated to
the extent provided for and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.02(e)_.

 

Section 1.06 _Adjustments to the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Not later than three (3) days prior to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth (i)
Sellers good faith estimate of the Coal Inventory as of the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Coal Inventory") and Coal Inventory Cost as of the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Coal Inventory Cost"), each in reasonable detail, along with
supporting documentation thereof, and (ii) Sellers good faith estimate of the
Parts and Supply Inventory as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Supply
Inventory") in reasonable detail, along with supporting documentation thereof.
For purposes hereof, the "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount determined as
follows:

 

(i) The Closing Adjustment will be adjusted by a negative amount (if Target
Coal Inventory is greater than Estimated Coal Inventory) or adjusted by a
positive amount (if Target Coal Inventory is less than Estimated Inventory)
(the "Closing Coal Inventory Adjustment") equal to the difference between
Estimated Coal Inventory and Target Coal Inventory (in tons, and expressed as
a positive number) _multiplied by_ the Estimated Coal Inventory Cost; and

 

(ii) the Closing Adjustment shall be further adjusted by a negative amount
(if Target Supply Inventory is greater than Estimated Supply Inventory) or
adjusted by a positive amount (if Target Supply Inventory is less than
Estimated Supply Inventory) by the difference between Estimated Supply
Inventory and Target Supply Inventory (expressed as a positive number). 

Each of the Coal Inventory Cost and the Parts and Supplies Inventory shall be
valued in accordance with GAAP, using the same accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications and estimation
methodologies as were used to prepare the Financial Statements. The
methodology to be used in preparing the Closing Statement, including the cost
items included therein and an illustrative calculation of each of the Coal
Inventory Cost

 



4

    

 and the Parts and Supplies Inventory as of June 30, 2018, and to calculate
the adjustments to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.06(f)_, is as set
forth on _Schedule 1.06_ attached hereto (the "Illustrative Adjustment
Schedule").

(b) As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date (which period shall be tolled for any failure by Buyer to
provide access in accordance with the following sentence), Seller shall (i)
calculate in good faith the Coal Inventory, Coal Inventory Cost, and Parts
and Supply Inventory, in each case as of the Closing Date and (ii) deliver to
Buyer a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the foregoing
calculations. Following the Closing and prior to the delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Shoal Creek Mine and any records
reasonably necessary for Sellers preparation of the Post-Closing Statement.
To the extent reasonably required for Buyers review of the Post-Closing
Statement, Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable access during normal
business hours to all working papers related to the preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement.

(c) If Buyer delivers written notice (the "Disputed Items Notice")
to Seller no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement, stating that it objects to any items on the Post-Closing Statement,
specifying the basis for such objection in reasonable detail and setting forth
the Buyers proposed modifications to the Post-Closing Statement (the
"Disputed __ Items"), then Seller and Buyer will attempt to resolve and
finally determine and agree upon the Disputed Items as promptly
as practicable. Any items not disputed by the Buyer in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.06(c)_ shall be deemed accepted.

 

(d) If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the Disputed Items within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Disputed Items Notice, Seller and
Buyer shall submit the unresolved Disputed Items specified in the Disputed
Items Notice to the appropriate Independent Expert(s). The Independent
Expert(s) shall address only the Disputed Items set forth in the Disputed
Items Notice, will be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
its calculations, and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item by either Party or smaller than the smallest value
claimed for such item by either Party. Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the
Independent Expert(s) such work papers and other documents and information
related to the disputed issues as the Independent Expert(s) may request and
are available to that Party (or its accountant), and each Party shall be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Expert(s) any materials
related to such issues and to discuss the same with Independent Expert(s). The
determination(s) of the Independent Expert(s) will be made no later than
sixty (60) days after being selected and will be final, binding and
unappealable/unchallengeable upon the Parties in the absence of manifest
error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Expert(s) will be borne
one-half (1/2) by the Buyer and one-half (1/2) by the Seller.

 

(e) If Buyer does not deliver the Disputed Items Notice to Seller within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, or if Buyer
agrees in writing that the calculations specified in the Post-Closing
Statement are acceptable, then such calculations in the Post-Closing Statement
will thereupon become final, binding and conclusive upon the Parties.

(f) _Final Adjustment_. If the sum of (A) the Final Coal Adjustment
_plus_ (B) the Final Parts and Supply Adjustment is a _positive_ amount, Buyer
shall pay such amount, if any, to Seller, and if such sum is a _negative_
amount, Seller shall pay such amount (as a positive amount), if any, to the
Buyer. Any payments due under this _Section_ __ _ 1.06(f)_ by either Buyer or
Seller shall be paid no later than the later to occur of sixty (60) days
following the Closing or five (5) Business Days after determination of the
Final Coal Adjustment and the Final Parts and Supply Adjustment. For purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_,

 

(i) "Final Coal Adjustment" shall mean an amount equal to the difference
between Coal Inventory as of the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.06(d)_ or _1.06(e)_ above ("Final Coal Inventory"), and
Estimated Coal Inventory, _multiplied by_ Coal Inventory Cost as of
the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.06(d)_
or _1.06(e)_ above. For the avoidance of doubt, the Final Coal Adjustment
shall be a positive number if Final Coal Inventory exceeds Estimated
Coal Inventory and a negative number if Estimated Coal Inventory exceeds
Final Coal Inventory.

(ii) "Final Parts and Supply Adjustment" shall mean an amount equal to the
difference between Parts and Supply Inventory as of the Closing Date, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.06(d)_ or _1.06(e)_
above ("Final Parts and Supply Inventory"), and Estimated Supply Inventory,
which amount shall be a positive number if Final Parts and Supply Inventory
exceeds Estimated Supply Inventory and a negative number if Estimated Supply
Inventory exceeds Final Parts and Supply Inventory.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts determined under this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.06_, the components thereof and adjustments thereto shall
each be determined without duplication of any amounts contained therein.

 

Section 1.07 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place, to the extent a physical
closing place is necessary, at the offices of Venable LLP, located at 8010
Towers Crescent Drive, Suite 300, Tysons, Virginia 22182, on the second
Business Day after satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article II_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), or such other place or other date as Buyer and
Seller may mutually agree. The Parties intend that the Closing be effected, to
the extent practicable, by conference call, the electronic delivery of
documents and the prior physical exchange of certain documents
and instruments to be held in escrow by outside counsel to the recipient
Party pending authorization of their release at the Closing by the delivering
Party (or its outside counsel). The date of the Closing is herein referred to
as the "Closing Date." The Closing will be deemed to occur at 11:59 p.m.
Birmingham, Alabama time on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no
breach arising out of the negotiation of, or failure to negotiate, the
Modified CBA shall be deemed to be within the reasonable control of Seller,
so long as Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts in connection
therewith.

_ARTICLE III _

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

 

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

 

Section 3.01 _Organization and Power_. Seller is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Alabama, with full corporate power to enter into this Agreement and the
other agreements required hereby and perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.01_ , Seller holds all
material authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own the Purchased
Assets and Shoal Creek Mine, and carry on the Business conducted by it as now
conducted. Seller is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in
which its ownership of the Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business
conducted by it requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.02 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which Seller is a party by Seller and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Seller, and no
other proceedings on Sellers part are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to
which Seller is a party. Assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding
obligation of Buyer, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies. When each other Transaction Document
to which Seller is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Seller (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding
obligation of Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
Laws affecting creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting
the availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies.

Section 3.03 _No Breach; Consents_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule_ __
_ 3.03_, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance of the Purchased Assets by Seller to
Buyer, do not and will not conflict with or result in any material breach of,
constitute a material default under or an event that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default,

 



12

    

 under, result in a material violation of, result in the acceleration of or
create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel,
result in the creation of any material Lien upon the Purchased Assets, or
require any material authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other
material action by or notice to any Governmental Authority or other third
party, in each case, with respect to or under the provisions of (i) Sellers
Articles of Incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any material Lease, material Assumed
Contract (including any Material Contract), any DCS Contract, (iii) any
material Permit (including any Environmental Permit or Mining Permit) or (iv)
any Law or any Order of any Governmental Authority to which the Purchased
Assets or Business is subject other than any such authorizations, consents,
approvals, exemptions or other actions required under the Antitrust Laws. 

Section 3.04 _Financial Condition_ _; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 
_Schedule_ __ _ 3.04_ consists of (a) audited combined balance sheets of the
Business as of December 31, 2017 (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015, and the related audited combined statements of
income and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended (collectively, the
"Audited Financial Statements") and (b) unaudited combined balance sheets of
the Business as of June 30, 2018, and the related unaudited combined
statements of income and cash flows for the six-month period then ended
(collectively, the "Interim Financial Statements" and, together with the
Audited Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements"). Other than as set
forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.04_, the Financial Statements do not include or
take into consideration any assets, Liabilities or results of operations
other than the Business, Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities. The
Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
condition and results of operations of the Business (taken as a whole) as of
the times and for the periods referred to therein in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, subject in the case of the Interim Financial Statements
to the absence of notes and to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
(none of which will be material to the Business, taken as a whole). The
Business has no Liabilities required to be reflected on a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except (a) those which are adequately
reflected or reserved against in the balance sheets contained in the
Financial Statements, (b) any reclamation Liabilities related to the Business
with respect to the applicable Mining Permits, or (c) those which have been
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since June 30, 2018 and which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material in amount. The Illustrative Adjustment Schedule is a true, correct
and complete calculation of the Coal Inventory Cost and the Parts and
Supplies Inventory as of June 30, 2018 valued in accordance with GAAP, using
the same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications and estimation methodologies as were used
to prepare the Financial Statements.

Section 3.05 _Absence of Certain Developments_. Except as set forth on 
_Schedule 3.05_ , since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect nor any event, development or occurrence that
could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 3.05_, since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet,
the Seller has not taken any action which would, if taken after the Effective
Date and prior to the Closing Date without the Buyers written
consent, constitute a violation of _Section_ __ _ 5.01_.

Section 3.06 _Tangible Personal Property_. Seller owns good title to or
holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases all of the tangible personal
property, including machinery,

 



13

    

 equipment, equipment leases, inventories of parts and supplies, automobiles,
trucks, tractors, trailers, loaders, other mobile equipment, tools, furniture
and equipment used in the Business, all of which (excluding the Excluded
Assets) is set forth on or otherwise described in _Schedule 3.06(a)_ (such
tangible personal property, excluding the Excluded Assets, the "Tangible
Personal __ Property"). All such Tangible Personal Property is held free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, except as disclosed on
_Schedule 3.06(a)_. Tangible Personal Property that is material to the
operation of the Business is in good working order and repair (normal
industry wear and tear excepted), has been operated and maintained in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with prudent underground coal
mining industry standards, and is suitable and in adequate condition for use
consistent with past practices and prudent underground coal mining industry
practices. Except for the Excluded Assets and as set forth in _Schedule
3.06(b)_ , the Tangible Personal Property (whether owned or leased) together
with all other Purchased Assets are sufficient for the continued conduct of
the Business after the Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted
immediately prior to the Closing and constitute all of the material rights,
property and assets necessary to conduct the Business as currently conducted
in the ordinary course of business. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.06(c)_
, there are no assets, properties or services that are used in the operation
of the Business as currently conducted that are provided by any Affiliate of
Seller. All of the Finished Goods Coal, whether reflected in the Financial
Statements or otherwise, consists of a quality and quantity usable and salable
on a standalone or blended basis in the ordinary and usual course
of business. No Coal Inventory is held on a consignment basis. The quantities
of each item of Parts and Supplies Inventory are not excessive, but are
reasonable in the present circumstances of Seller.

 

Section 3.07 _Tax Matters_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.07_ , and
solely with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets, and the Assumed
Liabilities:

(a) To the Sellers Knowledge, Seller has filed or caused to be filed all
material Tax Returns that are required to be filed by Seller, all such Tax
Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects, all material
Taxes due and owing by Seller (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods have been paid, all material Taxes which Seller is
obligated to withhold or collect from amounts owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or third party have been duly
withheld or collected and have been paid to the proper Governmental Authority
when required.

 

(b) To Sellers Knowledge, (i) there is currently no material dispute or
other claim concerning any Tax Liability of Seller claimed or raised by any
taxing authority of which Seller received written notice, and (ii) Seller has
not waived any statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes beyond the
date thereof or agreed to any extension of time beyond the date thereof with
respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency. The Seller has not
received written notice from any taxing authority indicating an intent to open
an audit or other review (other than audits that are currently pending or
already closed).

(c) To Sellers Knowledge, no claim has been made in writing within the
previous six (6) years by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Seller
does not file Tax Returns that the Seller is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction, nor is the Seller aware of any such claim. 

 



14

    

(d) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable
or are being contested in good faith) upon any of the assets of the Seller.

(e) The Seller has no liability for the Taxes of any Person (A) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor, or (C) under any Tax-
sharing or Tax allocation agreement or any other agreement providing for
payments by the Seller with respect to Taxes.

 

(f) Seller is not a "foreign person" as that term is used in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2.

(g) To Sellers Knowledge, the Seller has not engaged in any "reportable
transactions" within the meaning of Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

This _Section_ __ _ 3.07_, _Section_ __ _ 3.11_, and _Section_ __ _ 3.16_
contain the sole and exclusive representations and warranties with respect to
any Tax matters relating to Seller or the Purchased Assets. The
representations and warranties in this _Section_ __ _ 3.07_ refer only to the
activities of Seller prior to the Closing and are not intended to serve as
representations to, or a guarantee of, nor can they be relied upon for, or
with respect to, Taxes attributable to any Tax periods (or portions thereof)
beginning, or Tax positions taken, after the Closing Date.

Section 3.08 _Contracts and Commitments_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.08(a)_, as of the Effective
Date, the Assumed Contracts and the DCS Contracts do not include any written
or oral (each Contract set forth on _Schedule 3.08(a)_ is referred to herein
as a "Material Contract"):

 

(i) Contract by and between Seller and any Affiliate of Seller;

 

(ii) Contract (a) for the employment of any Person on a full-time or part-

all or substantially all of the Purchased Assets, or similar transaction with
respect to the Shoal Creek Mine or the Business, in each case, other than the
sale of Coal Inventory in the ordinary course of business. Seller shall
immediately cease, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to immediately
cease, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any purchase, in whatever form, of all or
substantially all of the Purchased Assets, or similar transaction with respect
to the Shoal Creek Mine or the Business.

 

(b) Upon reasonable advance notice from Buyer, Seller shall (i) afford
Buyer and Buyers Representatives reasonable access to the Purchased Assets,
Shoal Creek Mine and Business and (ii) furnish to Buyer and Buyers
Representatives such additional financial and operating data and other
information regarding the Purchased Assets, Shoal Creek Mine and Business as
Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that any
such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at Buyers sole
cost and expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of
Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be required to disclose
any information to Buyer or Buyers Representatives if such disclosure would,
in Sellers reasonable discretion, (x) without limiting Sellers obligations
to provide information to Buyers outside counsel under  _Section_ __ _
5.09_, cause specific competitive harm to Seller or its Affiliates and their
respective businesses if the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated, (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or
(z) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement

 customers, suppliers and other business relations of Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without prior
consultation with and written approval of Seller. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, Seller
may withhold any document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement or portions of documents or information relating to
pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such
documents (or portions thereof) or information, as reasonably determined by
the Seller, might reasonably be expected to result in, or result in
the appearance of, an antitrust violation. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller shall not be required to disclose any communications,
documents or information to Buyer or Buyers Representatives that are subject
to attorney-client privilege.

(c) The Parties agree that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with 
_Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)_ shall include having such provision specifically
enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and
agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable
injury to Buyer and that monetary damages would not provide an adequate
remedy to Buyer.

Section 5.05 _NDA; Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement are hereby incorporated
herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing, at which time such Non-Disclosure Agreement and the obligations of
Buyer thereunder shall terminate;  _provided, however_ , that the Non-
Disclosure Agreement shall remain in force and shall not terminate with
respect to that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Non-
Disclosure Agreement) relating to the Excluded Assets or otherwise not
exclusively relating to the Business. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 

(b) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, and solely to the
extent such Evaluation Material is a Purchased Asset, Seller and its
Affiliates will treat and hold as such any Evaluation Material (as defined in
the Non-Disclosure Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
information shall be Evaluation Material to the extent that it (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Seller or its
Affiliates, (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller
from and after the Closing from sources which, to Sellers Knowledge, Seller
or such acquiring Affiliate are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (iii) is, for
avoidance of doubt, an Excluded Asset. In addition, it shall not be a
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ for Seller or its Affiliates to
disclose Evaluation Material (1) as required by any requirements of Law or
legal process or (2) as reasonably necessary for Seller or its respective
Affiliates to manage or discharge the Excluded Liabilities, including without
limitation to disclose Evaluation Material to legal and financial advisors and
potential financing sources or (3) in connection with the preparation and
delivery of financial statements of Seller and/or its Affiliates. If Seller or
any of its Affiliates are compelled to disclose any Evaluation Material by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law in
connection with clause (1) above, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in
writing, and Seller shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, only disclose
that portion of the information which it is advised by its counsel is legally
required to be disclosed.

 



31

    

Section 5.06 _Updates; Notification_. From the Effective Date until the
Closing Date, Seller may disclose to Buyer in writing (in the form of updated
Disclosure Schedules) any material variances from the representations and
warranties contained in _Article_ __ _ III_, and of any other fact or event
that constitutes a breach of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement
made by Seller. The disclosures shall amend and supplement the appropriate
Disclosure Schedules delivered on the Effective Date; _provided that_ ,
the disclosures shall not be deemed to amend and supplement the appropriate
Disclosure Schedules for purposes of the conditions to closing set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_ or Buyers ability to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_. Without limiting the
foregoing, any misrepresentation or breach of representation by the Seller
arising out of any action taken after the Effective Date and prior to the
Closing Date at the request of or with the consent of the Buyer shall be
deemed to have been cured by the act of such request or consent for all
purposes under this Agreement, without delivery of any supplement to the
Disclosure Schedules or other action on the part of the Seller, and Buyer
shall not have any claim against any Seller Related Party or any other Person
for any such breach or inaccuracy.

 

Section 5.07 _Personnel Matters_.

 

(a) Because a majority of the Re-Hired Employees who will be employed by
Buyer will be the former Union Employees of Seller, Buyer agrees that
immediately upon the Closing, Buyer will become signatory to the United Mine
Workers of America ("UMWA") Modified Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2018,
as modified by the letters set forth on _Schedule 5.07(a)_ and duly ratified
by the Union Employees (collectively, the "Modified CBA"), and will assume all
obligations and liabilities under the Modified CBA only insofar as such
Modified CBA applies to the operation of the Shoal Creek Mine (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be deemed to have adopted the Modified CBA
for purposes of application to any operations relating to any mine other than
the Shoal Creek Mine). Subject to the Modified CBA, Buyer will recognize the
UMWA and the Locals as the collective bargaining representatives of the Re-
Hired Union Employees upon Closing. The Modified CBA will be
substantially similar to the Drummond CBA but will have been amended to
reflect those enumerated changes set forth in _Schedule 2.01(d)_ , unless a
change or changes are waived by the Buyer as a condition to close. Seller
shall keep Buyer apprised of the negotiations with UMWA and will periodically
deliver drafts of the Modified CBA to Buyer for its review and comment.

 

(b) "Union Employees" mean Sellers Employees who are covered by the
Drummond CBA or the Modified CBA and were immediately prior to the Closing
Date (i) actively at work in connection with the Business, (ii) off work and
receiving sickness and accident, long-term disability or workers compensation
benefits in connection with the Business, (iii) on another leave of absence
approved by Seller in connection with the Business or (iv) on layoff with
recall rights as provided under the Drummond CBA. Buyer agrees to make offers
of employment to Union Employees actively at work consistent with the
requirements of the Modified CBA with such offers providing for employment
effective on the Closing Date. Buyer further agrees to make offers of
employment to those Union Employees who are not 

 



32

    

 actively at work as soon as they are able to return to work consistent with
the requirements of the Modified CBA. Union Employees who are employed by
Buyer after the Closing Date will be referred to as "Re-Hired Union
Employees."

(c) "Nonunion Employees" mean Sellers Employees who are not subject to
the Drummond CBA or the Modified CBA nor on the Excluded Employees List and
were immediately prior to the Closing Date (i) actively at work in connection
with the Business or (ii) on short-term disability in connection with the
Business. Buyer agrees to make offers of employment to substantially all of
the Nonunion Employees, effective on the Closing, on terms and conditions of
employment that Buyer establishes in its sole discretion. Nonunion Employees
who accept Buyers offer are employed by Buyer after the Closing Date will be
referred to as "Re-Hired Nonunion Employees."

 

(d) Re-Hired Nonunion Employees and Re-Hired Union Employees will
collectively be referred to as "Re-Hired Employees."

 

(e) Buyer will pay and provide, in its discretion (or as required by the
Modified CBA for Re-Hired Union Employees), the Re-Hired Employees with wages
and fringe benefits through employee benefit plans and programs established by
Buyer.

 

(f) Buyer will provide and administer all required notices and benefits
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") to
all Re-Hired Employees resulting from any loss of or change in coverage after
they become Re-Hired Employees. Seller will provide all required notices and
benefits under COBRA resulting from any loss of or change in coverage to (A)
all of its Employees who do not become Re-Hired Employees, and (B) all Re-
Hired Employees before they become Re-Hired Employees.

 

(g) With respect to the Re-Hired Employees, Buyer will have full
responsibility for compliance or non-compliance with the WARN Act, and any
other similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any
plant closing or mass layoff that occurs after the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer is
solely responsible for any claims, lawsuits, liabilities, obligations, Labor
and Employment Disputes and Union Grievances arising from any layoff of Re-
Hired Employees that Buyer implements after the Closing Date.

 

(h) Obligations for any action, claim, suit, litigation, arbitration,
proceeding (including any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
appellate proceeding), hearing, examination, investigation or Damages arising
out of or relating to "pneumoconiosis," as such term is defined in 20 CFR §
718.201, including any of the foregoing brought under the Federal Coal Mine
Health and Safety Act, as amended, the Black Lung Benefits Act, title 30 of
the United States Code, sections 901 et seq., the Black Lung Benefits Reform

respect to such claims.

for Buyer for less than one year when the claim was filed.

 

(iii) With regard to Claimants who are, or are claiming on behalf of, Re-

applicable state, and any and all other claims or benefits for injuries or
occupational diseases arising under any Law and not covered by _Section_ __ _
5.07(h)_ ("Workers Compensation Claims"), (i) Seller will be responsible
for, and shall indemnify Buyer for all Damages incurred by Buyer in connection
with, all Liabilities with respect to (A) Sellers employees and former

or threatened by any Governmental Authority, Proceedings before the Chairman
of the Labor Management Policy Committee under Article II of the Drummond
CBA, and grievances at Step 2 or higher under the Drummond CBA.

benefit of any awards or payments, if any, resulting from any Labor and
Employment Disputes and Union Grievances or any applicable state or federal
labor or employment Law or administrative regulation that (i) relate to

purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to

consummate the

 



36

    

 transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such Order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation

party in connection with, any proposed written communications by such Party to
any third party or any Governmental Authority concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Buyer shall keep Seller apprised of the status of all filings and
submissions referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_, including promptly

with any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings and submissions
unless it consults with Seller in advance and, to the extent permitted by the
Governmental Authority, gives Seller the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

 

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith with all Governmental Authorities and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take any and all actions required to complete lawfully
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable and any
and all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any
proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or the
issuance of any Order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise
prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 _Buyer_ __ _s Financial Assurance_ _. _ Promptly following
the Effective Date, Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain in a form and manner satisfactory to Buyer and Seller any and all
bonds, reclamation bonds, letters of credit and other financial
assurances required by Environmental Laws or by any other Law in connection
with the Business (collectively "Buyers Required Financial Assurance").
Buyers Required Financial Assurance is intended to and shall
replace, cancel, supersede and release, as of the Closing Date, those bonds,
reclamation bonds, letters of credit and other financial assurances set forth
on _Schedule 5.10_ which are required of Seller by Environmental Laws or other
Laws in connection with the Business ("Sellers Financial Assurance").
Following the Effective Date, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, use
its commercially reasonable efforts, with cooperation from Seller, to assure
that Seller is released, effective as of Closing, from all obligations with
respect to Sellers Financial Assurance, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from any and all damages incurred by Seller as a result of
Buyers failure to obtain such release as of

 



37

    

 Closing or to otherwise obtain Buyers Required Financial Assurance by the
Closing. Seller shall cause all Sellers Financial Assurance to remain in
place and not be terminated or modified in any way from the date of this
Agreement through the date that Seller is released from Sellers Financial
Assurance by appropriate Governmental Authority and Buyer has obtained Buyers
Required Financial Assurance.

 

Section 5.11 _Transfer of Permits_ _._ Within ten (10) business days
following the Effective Date and prior to Closing, Buyer will prepare in a
form and manner satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, and Buyer and Seller, as
applicable, will file with each of the Governmental Authorities set forth on
_Schedule 5.11(a)_ , all applications (collectively, the "Successor Permittee
Applications") required for the transfer to Buyer of all of the Sellers or
others (i) coal mining and related permits and authorizations, in each case
as set forth on  _Schedule 5.11(a)_ (collectively, the "Mining Permits") and
(ii) Environmental Permits set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_ ; _provided that_ ,
with respect to any application for a Permit currently under review,
such transfer documentation shall be submitted by Buyer as soon as practical
following the issuance of such Permit. Seller shall take commercially
reasonable steps to cooperate with Buyer in completing all necessary forms to
effect the Successor Permittee Applications. The Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such Mining Permits and
Environmental Permits set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_ to be effective as of
Closing. In connection with the foregoing, each Party will (a) promptly
notify the other Party of any written communications to that Party or its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law,
provide the other party with a copy of any written communication to or from
any Governmental Authority with respect to any filings, investigations or
inquiry concerning the Mining Permits and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (b) not participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any such filings,
investigations or inquiries unless it consults with the other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings or
discussions. The Successor Permittee Applications will include Buyers
Required Financial Assurance of a type and value required under Law and
satisfactory to the appropriate Governmental Authorities in order to
substitute for, replace and supersede the Sellers Financial Assurance, so
that such Governmental Authorities may approve the transfer of the Mining
Permits to Buyer and, as soon as reasonable practicable thereafter, release
such Sellers Financial Assurance and all collateral therefor, in each case
effective as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall bear the fees and other costs
incurred by it with respect to the bonds and other security it may post in
connection with the foregoing. For clarification, it is the intention of the
Parties that each such Mining Permit and Environmental Permit set forth on
_Schedule 5.11(a)_ be transferred to Buyer effective as of the Closing Date,
to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Authorities, and that
Buyers Required Financial Assurance shall not become effective until the
Closing Date. Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, will take all actions as
may be necessary to release and discharge Seller form all obligations under
the Mining Permits and the Environmental Permits, to the extent related to the
Business, effective as of Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller for any and all Damages incurred
by Seller as a result of any breach or any noncompliance with this Section.

 

Section 5.12 _Consents_. With respect to each Consent set forth on
_Schedule 3.03_ , prior to Closing, Seller shall send to the holder of each
such right to Consent a notice in compliance

 



38

    

 with the contractual provisions applicable to such required Consent and, to
the extent required by such contractual provisions, seeking such holders
consent to the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to Closing, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, with reasonable assistance from
Buyer (including Buyer providing commercially reasonable assurances of
financial condition and qualifications which may be requested by such third
party), to give (in the case of notices) or obtain, as applicable all Consents
listed on _Schedule 3.03_ ; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not be
required to incur any liability or pay any money in order to give or
obtain any such Consent.

Section 5.13 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date and without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, solicit for employment or hire
or employ any of (i) the current employees of Buyer or its Affiliates to whom
Seller or its Affiliates had been directly or indirectly introduced or

Agreement, so long as they are employed by Buyer or its Affiliates or (ii)
any employee of the Business who is a Re-Hired Employee, or induce, or
attempt to induce, any employee referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) to terminate his or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her
relationship with Buyer or its Affiliates; _provided that_ , the foregoing

employee of the Business who responds to general solicitation
employment advertising in the media not directed specifically toward the
employees of Buyer or its Affiliates or Re-Hired Employees of the Business.

otherwise had contact with as a result of its or their consideration,
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, so long as they are employed by Seller or its Affiliates or (ii)
any employee of the Business who is an Excluded Employee other than in
accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement, or induce, or
attempt to induce, any employee referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) to terminate his or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her
relationship with Seller or its Affiliates; _provided that_ , the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to any such employee of Seller or its Affiliates

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 



39

    

(b) by Buyer, so long as Buyer is not in material breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, if there
has been a material violation or breach by Seller of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented

Buyer to deliver the Closing Amount at the Closing) and the violation or
breach has not been waived by Seller or, in the case of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement breach, cured by Buyer within ten Business
Days after written notice thereof by Seller ( _provided that_ , neither a
breach by Buyer of _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ (Financial Capability) that is not
curable by Buyer on or prior to the Closing nor the failure by Buyer to
deliver the full consideration payable pursuant to _Article_ __ _ I_ of this
Agreement at the Closing will be subject to cure unless otherwise agreed in
writing by Seller); or

(d) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing does not occur on or prior to
5:00 p.m., Birmingham, Alabama time, on January 17, 2019 (the "Termination
Date"); _provided that_ , if prior to the Termination Date, the conditions to
the Closing set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ have not been satisfied
(or waived) but all other conditions to the Closing (other than those
conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have

Seller to no later than March 20, 2019; _provided further that_ , no Party
will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date.

 

Section 6.02 _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of this Agreement
by Buyer or Seller as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, the provisions of
this Agreement will immediately become void and of no further force or effect
(other than this _Article VI_ , _Article VIII_ , and _Appendix_ __ _ 1_
hereto which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms; _provided, however_ , that the Non-Disclosure Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms), and there shall be no liability on the part of any of the Parties to
one another. Nothing in this _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall be deemed to impair the
right of any Party to compel specific performance by another Party of its
obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.16_.

after the applicable expiration time of such representation; _provided that_
, if at any time prior to the applicable expiration time, Buyer delivers to
the Seller a notice asserting the existence of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by Seller (and setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for Buyers determination that the breach exists and the
amount of the Damages being claimed, in each case to the extent then known, as
a result of such breach) and asserting a claim for recovery under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_ based on the breach, then the claim asserted in the
notice shall survive the expiration date until such time as the claim is fully
and finally resolved.

 

(c) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify any Buyer
Related Party for any and all Damages incurred by a Buyer Related Party as a
result of (i) a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any

 



41

    

 representation or warranty of Seller set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_, (ii)
a breach of any covenant or other agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Assets, (iv) the Excluded Liabilities, (v) the
operation of the Business prior to Closing, or (vi) any Liability imposed upon

to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing,

incurred by a Seller Related Party as a result of (I) a breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in _Article_
__ _ IV_, (II) a breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement,
or (III) the Assumed Liabilities.

(d) _Sole Remedy_. Except in the case of Fraud or as contemplated by 
_Section_ __ _ 8.17_, from and after the Closing, the right of a Party to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to all Damages of whatever kind and nature, in
law, equity or otherwise, known or unknown, which any Buyer Related Party or
Seller Related Party, as applicable, have now or may have in the future,
including any Damages arising under, out of or related to any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty, or any failure to perform the
covenants, agreements or undertakings contained in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or any
agreement or other document contemplated hereby, and no Person shall have any
other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise,
it being agreed that all such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties (for themselves and on behalf of
their respective successors and permitted assigns) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_ shall
limit any Persons right to seek specific performance or to seek any remedy
on account of Fraud. __

(e) _Deductible and Cap_. Without limiting the effect of any other
limitation contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, the indemnification

aggregate amount of the Damages for which Buyer would otherwise be entitled
to be indemnified under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ exceeds $4,000,000 (the
"Deductible"). If the aggregate amount of Damages for which Buyer is entitled
to indemnification as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ exceeds the
Deductible, then Buyer shall, subject to the other limitations contained
herein, be entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of the Damages
that exceeds the Deductible. The aggregate liability of Seller in respect of
the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ shall
not exceed $40,000,000 (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap and
the Deductible shall not apply to or limit the amount of Damages for which
Buyer may seek indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ for breach of
any Fundamental Representations or Fraud on the part of Seller.

 

(f) _Third Party Claims_ _._ If a third party initiates a Proceeding (a
"Third Party Claim") for which a party (the "Indemnified Party") may seek
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days) deliver written notice thereof to the
party from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party");
_provided_ that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_, no delay in providing
such notice shall affect the Indemnified Partys rights hereunder unless the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The notice shall contain
a reasonably detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and
amount, if reasonably known, of the Damages for which 

 



42

    

 indemnification is sought ("Indemnifiable Damages"). The obligations of the
Indemnifying Party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ with respect to
Indemnifiable Damages arising from any Third Party Claim shall be governed by
the following additional terms and conditions:

 

(i) The Indemnifying Party, at its option, shall be entitled to assume
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim at any time within 30 days
after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party and
may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material events and developments, including promptly providing copies of any
correspondence and court filings, with respect to the Third Party Claim.

(ii) In any event where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of the Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice in
connection with such participation;  _provided that,_ such employment shall
be at the Indemnified Partys sole cost and expense; _provided that_ (A) if in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, or (B) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume
(or elects not to assume) the defense, fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in
this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its choice and may
defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Damages
based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided,
further_ , that if it is ultimately determined by agreement of the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party or by a court of competent jurisdiction that
the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder with
respect to the Third Party Claim, such fees and expenses shall not be
Indemnifiable Damages.

 

(iii) Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(g) _Subrogation_. To the extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, Seller shall be entitled to
exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that
Buyer or any Buyer Related Party may have against any other Person with
respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which the indemnification
is directly or indirectly related.

 

(h) _Payments Net of Insurance_. Any payment made to Buyer in respect of
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ will be net of any insurance proceeds actually
recovered by any Buyer Related Party in respect of the claim after taking into
account any costs incurred in pursuing the insurance claim or increases in
premiums resulting from such claim, and the Parties agree to use

 



43

    

 (and to cause the Buyer Related Party to use) commercially reasonable
efforts to timely file such claims with the applicable insurance provider and
to comply with the adjustment and investigation requirements and procedures
of the insurance provider.

(i) _Payments Net of Tax Benefits_. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Section 7.01 shall be decreased to take into account any
deduction, credit or other Tax benefit actually received by the indemnitee
with respect to the subject Damages.

 

(j) _No Double Recovery_. Buyer shall not be entitled to double recovery
for any adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for hereunder or for any
Damages even though the Damages may have resulted from the breach of more than
one of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement or any other agreement executed in connection herewith.

(k) _No Enhancement_. Buyer shall not recover any amounts that represent
the cost of repairs, replacements or improvements that enhance the value of
the repaired, replaced or improved assets above their value on the Closing
Date, or which represent the cost of repair or replacement exceeding the
lowest reasonable cost of repair or replacement.

(l) _Duty to Mitigate_. If and when Buyer becomes aware of Damages for
which it may seek indemnification under this Agreement, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Damages and Seller shall not
be liable or responsible for any Damages to the extent attributable to Buyers
failure to so mitigate.

 

(m) _Reasonableness of Limitations_. The Parties agree that the limits
imposed on Buyers remedies with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to Seller hereunder and the specific
representations and warranties made in this Agreement.

(n) _Payment_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 10 Business Days of
such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party
not make full payment of any such obligations within such 10 Business
Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the
date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable
adjudication to and including the date such payment has been made at a rate
per annum equal to 5%. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of
a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall apply in lieu
of any pre-or post-judgment interest rates available under applicable Law.

(o) _MEP Escrow Fund_. On the Closing Date, in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 1.07(b)_, Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent the MEP Escrow Amount.
The MEP Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the
Escrow Agreement. The MEP Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive source to
compensate the Buyer Related Parties for the indemnification obligations of
Seller under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(vi)_. Any amounts payable to the Buyer
Related Parties under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(vi)_ (other than amounts that
the Buyer Related

 



44

    

 Parties may recover directly from Seller in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 7.01_) shall be paid by the Escrow Agent (on behalf of Seller) to such
Buyer Related Parties out of the MEP Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. On the ten (10) year anniversary of the Closing Date
(or the next Business Day if such date is not a Business Day), the Escrow
Agent shall release to Seller any amounts then remaining in the Escrow
Account less the amount of any pending and unresolved claims for indemnity
under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(vi)_.

 

(p) _Exceptions to Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no limitation on
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ or otherwise in
this Agreement shall apply to any Damages incurred by an Indemnified Party to
the extent that such Damages arise from any Fraud claim.

(q) _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), Seller
and Buyer shall treat any and all Purchase Price adjustments and
indemnification payments as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

Section 7.02 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property taxes) and that
are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the amount of such taxes that
is allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on (and including)
the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period (or in the case of such taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period. Seller shall be responsible for all such Taxes that
are attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date. The party required by law to pay any such tax
(the "Paying Party") shall file the Tax Return related to such tax within the
time period prescribed by law and shall timely pay such tax. To the extent
any such payment exceeds the obligation of the Paying Party hereunder, the
Paying Party shall provide the other party (the "Non-Paying Party") with
notice of payment, and within 10 days of receipt of such notice of payment,
the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the Paying Party for the Non-Paying
Partys share of such taxes.

(b) _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns with respect to the Business
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Straddle Periods or Post-Closing Tax
Periods, and in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding
initiated by a Governmental Authority with respect to such Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the reasonable furnishing or making available
during normal business hours of personnel on a mutually convenient basis and
the retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax
Return or to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding. Buyer and Seller
shall (a) retain or cause to be

 



45

    

 retained all books and records that are in its possession with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Business relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extension
thereof) of the applicable taxable periods, and abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (b) give the
other Party reasonable written notice before transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests,
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller shall, upon request,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transaction contemplated hereby).

 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added, and other such similar Taxes and fees (including
any penalties and interest thereon) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any
filing expenses associated therewith, shall be timely paid by Buyer when due,
and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes and fees.

 

(d) _Allocation of Purchase Price_ _._ Seller shall prepare an allocation
of the Purchase Price (as adjusted for the Assumed Liabilities and other
items required to be taken into account for income Tax purposes) among the
Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Seller shall deliver such allocation to Buyer within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, and within thirty (30) days
thereafter, Buyer may provide comments on such allocation, which comments
Seller shall take into account in good faith; provided that Parties agree to
allocate $2,986,500 of the Purchase Price to the Owned Real Property. If the
Parties agree as to the allocation, (i) the Parties shall, and shall cause all
of their respective Affiliates to, report, act, and file all Tax Returns,
in all respects and for all purposes, consistently with the allocations
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_, and (ii) none of the
Parties hereto shall, or shall permit their Affiliates to, take any position
on any Tax Returns or with any taxing authority that is inconsistent with
such allocations unless required to do so by applicable law.

 

Section 7.03 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when
requested by any Party and at such requesting Partys expense, any other
Party will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such
further actions as such requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties.

Section 8.05 _Severability_ _._ Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and the Parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid
provision that gives effect to the intent of the Parties to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



48

    

Section 8.06 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this
Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied
against any Person. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes
of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to sections of
this Agreement; _provided that_ , each section of the Disclosure Schedules
will be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedules if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined
therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no Party will use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third party of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract).

 

Section 8.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived only in a writing signed by Buyer and Seller. No waiver
of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will extend to or
affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or
default.

 

Section 8.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents
referred to herein (including the Non-Disclosure Agreement) contain the
complete agreement by, between and among the Parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by, between or among the
Parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof
in any way. The Parties agree that prior drafts of this Agreement and of any
provision herein will be deemed to not provide any evidence as to the meaning
of any provision hereof or the intent of the Parties with respect hereto and
that such drafts will be deemed joint work product of the Parties. The Parties
have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations in
respect of the purchase and sale of the Business and the Purchased Assets
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the agreements related hereto; and the Parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies
not expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any other Transaction
Document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Furthermore, the Parties each
hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations
of sophisticated Parties derived from arms-length negotiations; all Parties
to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special
relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation beyond
that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction.

 



49

    

Section 8.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic
transmission in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one Party, but all such counterparts
taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 8.10 _Governing Law_ _._ This Agreement, and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements executed
and performed entirely within such State.

Section 8.11 _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS_. _ _ EXCEPT
FOR MATTERS CONTROLLED BY THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF
THE UNITED STATES LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IN RESPECT OF
THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
ANY RELATED AGREEMENT, CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, OR, IF SUCH COURTS DECLINE THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION, THE
COMMERCIAL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY AND STATE OF NEW
YORK, AND BY THIS AGREEMENT WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, ANY DEFENSE IN ANY
ACTION FOR THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED
AGREEMENT, CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH,
THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS
NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SUCH COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN
OR BY SUCH COURTS OR THAT THEIR PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION,
THAT THE ACTION IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, OR THAT THE VENUE OF THE
ACTION IS IMPROPER. SERVICE OF PROCESS WITH RESPECT THERETO MAY BE MADE UPON A
PARTY BY MAILING A COPY THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE
PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS AS PROVIDED IN _SECTION 8.03_.

Section 8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY

TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

 



50

    

 BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12_.

 

Section 8.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. __ Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement,
and, to the extent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, the Buyer Related
Parties and the Seller Related Parties, any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement.

 

Section 8.14 _Representation of Seller and its Affiliates_. Buyer agrees,
on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Related Parties, that, following
the Closing, Venable LLP may serve as counsel to Seller and the other Seller
Related Parties in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Venable
LLP of Seller prior to the Closing Date. Buyer hereby (a) waives any claim it
has or may have that Venable LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agrees that, if a
dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer and Seller or any Seller
Related Party, Venable LLP may represent Seller or any Seller Related Party
in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly
adverse to Buyer and even though Venable LLP may have represented Seller in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer represents to Seller that
Buyers own attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications
and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict against Venable
LLP, and Buyers consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed. Buyer
also further agrees that, as to all communications among Venable LLP and
Seller or Seller Related Parties and representatives, that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may
be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer. In
addition, if the Closing occurs, all of the client files and records in
the possession of Venable LLP related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will continue to be property of (and be controlled by)
Seller, and Buyer shall not retain any copies of such records or have any
access to them.

 

Section 8.15 _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer;  Non-Recourse_.

Subject in all cases to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, Buyer
acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Business, and, in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the

 



51

    

 representations and warranties of Seller expressly and specifically set
forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, as qualified by
the Disclosure Schedules. The representations and warranties of Seller
expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of any kind of Seller to Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer understands, acknowledges and
agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities
of the Business, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Purchased
Assets) are specifically disclaimed by Seller. All representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and
subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth herein. SELLER DOES NOT
MAKE OR PROVIDE, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
OR CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES AS TO THE FOLLOWING:

 

(i) any dimension or specifications of any of the Purchased Assets or the
mineability, washability, volume, quantity or quality or recoverability, of
coal or reserves in, on or under the Shoal Creek Mine or the feasibility of
any mine plans;

 

(ii) pricing or value assumptions, or estimates attributable to the
Purchased Assets, or the ability or potential of the Purchased Assets for
mining purposes or the projected income or expenses for the Purchased Assets,
including any estimate and appraisal of the extent and value of the coal
seams, mining rights and reserves;

 

(iii) the mine life of the Shoal Creek Mine;

 

(iv) the adequacy for post-Closing operations of any refuse disposal plan
currently in place with respect to the Shoal Creek Mine; or

(v) the geological or engineering condition of any of the Purchased Assets,
including soundness, stability or surface or strata support.

(b) In connection with the investigation by Buyer of the Business and
the Purchased Assets, Buyer has received or may receive from Seller certain
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain
business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that
Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer
will have no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, except
for the representations and warranties of Seller expressly set forth in
_Article III_ of this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that none of Seller, any
Seller Related Party or any stockholder, member, manager, officer, director,
employee or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an individual,

 



52

    

 corporate or any other capacity, make any representation, warranty or other
statement with respect to, and Buyer is not relying on, such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and
Buyer agrees that it has not relied thereon.

 

Section 8.16 _Time of the Essence; Specific Performance; Other Remedies_.
Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. The Parties
agree that either Buyer or Seller may suffer irreparable damage prior to a
termination in the event that the Closing is not consummated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly,
the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Buyer or Seller of its covenants or obligations set forth
in this Agreement, Buyer or Seller, as applicable shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other Party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provision of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
Buyer and Seller under this Agreement, including seeking specific performance
to cause the Closing to occur, in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer
or Seller is entitled at law or in equity, including such Partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VI_ and to seek money
damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Party
shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause the Closing to occur
only if all conditions to the other Partys obligations to close the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than those that by their nature are
to be satisfied at Closing) have been satisfied. Buyer and Seller hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the other Party, other than the limitations set forth in
the preceding sentence. Buyer and Seller each hereby waive (i) any defenses in
any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond
or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

Section 8.17 _Prevailing Party_. If any Proceeding or arbitration is
commenced or threatened by any Party (the "Claiming Party") to enforce its
rights under this Agreement against any other Party (the "Defending Party"),
and if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in such Proceeding, then
all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court
costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such Proceeding will be reimbursed
by the Claiming Party; _provided that_ , if the Defending Party prevails in
part, and loses in part, in the Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other
adjudicator presiding over the Proceeding will award a reimbursement of the
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Defending Party on an equitable
basis. For purposes hereof, and without limitation, the Defending Party will
be deemed to have prevailed in any Proceeding described in the immediately
preceding sentence if the Claiming Party commences any such Proceeding and (a)
the underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed, or
(b) the Defending Party defeats any such claim(s).

Section 8.18 _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to which Seller is a party or
which is otherwise utilized within the Business 

 



53

    

 (including the Assumed Contracts) and such consents may not have been
obtained. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Seller shall have no Liability
whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer shall not be entitled to assert any claims)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have
been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any
such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof. Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition
of Buyer shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to
obtain any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination.

 

Section 8.19 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same the same instrument. Counterparts
may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic delivery
or transmission method (including pdf or any electronic signature complying
with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, _e.g._ www.docusign.com) (any
such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery") and any counterpart so delivered
shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and
effective for all purposes. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party will re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument will raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver
a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such Party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense related to lack of
authenticity.

Section 8.20 _Buyer Deliveries_. Any document or item shall be deemed
"delivered", "provided" or "made available" within the meaning of this
Agreement if such document or item (a) is included on or prior to two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement in the Merrill electronic
data room hosted by Seller, or (b) actually delivered or provided to Buyer or
any of Buyers representatives (including inside or outside counsel to Buyer).

 

Section 8.21 _Parent Guarantee_.

 

(a) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full
and prompt performance by Buyer of Buyers covenants, agreements and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (such
obligation, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This is a guarantee of performance
and payment and not only of collection. Guarantor waives promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of performance, demand of payment, filing of
any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Buyer, protest,
notice of any kind (including notices of acceptance hereof and of
defaults hereunder) and all demands whatsoever and all suretyship defenses
generally in connection with the performance of its covenants, agreements and
obligations set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the 

 



54

    

 foregoing, Guarantor shall be responsible for the payment of all expenses
and charges (including without limitation all court costs and reasonable
attorneys fees) paid or incurred by any Seller Related Party in realizing
upon any of the obligations guaranteed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.21(a)_.

 

(b) Guarantor represents and warrants to Buyer that (1) Guarantor is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of Delaware; (2) Guarantor has the requisite corporate authority to enter
into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; (3) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Guarantor and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Guarantor; (4) this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Guarantor; and
(5) the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and the compliance with
the provisions herein will not, conflict with or violate any applicable Law
or agreement binding upon Guarantor, nor require authorization, consent or
approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, except in each case
as would not impact Guarantors ability to perform or comply with its
obligations hereunder in any material respect.

(c) To the maximum extent permitted by Law, no modification, limitation or
discharge of liability of any other guarantor (if any) of the Guaranteed
Obligations or of Buyer under this Agreement or any related agreement,
instrument or document arising out of, or by virtue of, any bankruptcy,
arrangement, reorganization or similar proceedings for release of debtors
under federal or state law shall affect the liability of Guarantor hereunder
in any manner whatsoever, and Guarantor hereby waives all rights and benefits
which might otherwise accrue to it by reason of any such proceeding.

(d) For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Sections 8.02_ through
_8.13_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.19_ are incorporated into this _Section_ __ _
8.21_ and any references to "Party" in such Sections shall be deemed to
include the Guarantor.
