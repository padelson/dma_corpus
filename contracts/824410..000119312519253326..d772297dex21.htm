Agreement and Plan of Merger

 

This is an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 23, 2019
("Agreement"), by and among Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland
corporation ("Parent"), Sandy Spring Bank, a Maryland-chartered trust company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Parent Bank"), and Revere Bank, a
Maryland-chartered commercial bank (the "Company").

Introductory Statement

 

The Board of Directors of each of Parent, Parent Bank and the Company have
determined that this Agreement and the business combination and related
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the
strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to
which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
merge with and into Parent Bank (the "Merger"), with Parent Bank being the
surviving corporation and, accordingly, sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Bank."

The parties hereto intend that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "IRC") and that this Agreement is intended to be, and is
adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368
of the IRC and within the meaning of Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g).

Parent, Parent Bank and the Company each desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the business
combination and related transactions provided for herein and to prescribe
various conditions to such transactions.

 

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition
and inducement to Parents and Parent Banks willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the directors of the Company have entered into an agreement
pursuant to which each such director, in their capacity as a stockholder, has
agreed, among other things, to vote his or her shares of Company Common Stock
in favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the directors of Parent have entered into an agreement
pursuant to which each such director, in their capacity as a stockholder,
has agreed, among other things, to vote his or her shares of Parent Common
Stock in favor of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Merger.

 



1

    

In consideration of their mutual promises and obligations hereunder, the
parties hereto adopt and make this Agreement and prescribe the terms and
conditions hereof and the manner and basis of carrying it into effect, which
shall be as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

MERGER

 

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger substantially in
the form attached as _Exhibit A_ , in accordance with Maryland Financial
Institutions laws, MD Code, Financial Institutions, § 1-101 et seq., and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("Maryland Law"), Parent Bank
and Company shall merge, with Parent Bank the Surviving Bank in such merger.
As the Surviving Bank, Parent Bank shall continue its existence under Maryland
Law. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall terminate.

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place in the offices of
Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP, 607 14th Street NW, Washington, DC, or at
such other location as is agreed to by the parties hereto, at a time as agreed
to by the parties hereto on the date designated by Parent within seven (7)
days following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the
conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), or such later date as the parties
may otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").

1.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Parent Bank and the
Company shall duly execute and deliver Articles of Merger (the "Articles of
Merger") to the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation for
filing in accordance with Maryland Law. The Merger shall become effective
at such date and time as Parent Bank and the Company agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").

 

1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth
in Section 3-712 of Maryland Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Parent
Bank shall possess all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Company. The name of the Surviving Bank shall be "Sandy
Spring Bank." The principal banking office of the Surviving Bank shall be
17801 Georgia Avenue, Olney, Maryland 20832.

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of the common stock,
par value $5.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, other than (i) Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide
fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously
contracted, by Parent, Parent Bank the Company or a Subsidiary of either
(collectively "Excluded Shares"), shall become and be converted into the
right to receive 1.05000 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). The
consideration to be issued in the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration."

 



2

    

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be
issued in the Merger; instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the nearest thousandth) by
the Parent Average Price. "Parent Average Price" means the average closing
sales price per share, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent, of Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") for the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, as reported by Nasdaq.

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

 

1.6 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Parent Common Stock. At and after the
Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.7 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Common Stock of Parent Bank. At and after
the Effective Time, each share of Parent Bank Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.8 Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Bank. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation of Parent Bank, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Bank, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until such Articles of
Incorporation are thereafter amended in accordance with their terms
and applicable law.

1.9 Bylaws of Surviving Bank. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Parent
Bank, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Bank, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

 

1.10 Board of Directors of Parent and Surviving Bank. At the Effective Time,
the directors of Parent and Parent Bank shall be (i) the directors of Parent
and Parent Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) those
directors of the Company appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent and
Parent Bank in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, each to hold office in
accordance with the respective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent
and Parent Bank until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

 



3

    

1.11 Executive Officers of Parent and Surviving Bank. At the Effective
Time, the executive officers of Parent and Parent Bank immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the executive officers of Parent and the Surviving
Bank, each to hold office in accordance with the respective Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent and the Surviving Bank until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

1.12 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each option to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised as of the date
hereof (collectively, a "Company Stock Option") pursuant to the Company Stock
Plans. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options, other than
the Cashed-Out Company Stock Options (as defined below), that are outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, become fully vested and be converted into an option to purchase
Parent Common Stock (a "Converted Stock Option"), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option. The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Converted Stock Option will
be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the applicable Company Stock Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and the
exercise price of Parent Common Stock subject to each Converted Stock Option
will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per
Company Stock Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Stock
Options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
IRC) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent
with Section 424(a) of the IRC. Except as provided above, after the Effective
Time, the Converted Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Plans and any
award agreement. At all times after the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve
for issuance such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as necessary so as
to permit the exercise of Converted Stock Options in the manner contemplated
by this Agreement and in the instruments pursuant to which such options were
granted. Shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Converted
Stock Options shall be covered by an effective registration statement on Form
S-8 (or other applicable form), and Parent shall file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) covering such shares as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
such Converted Stock Options remain outstanding. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by any person who, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, has been notified by Parent that (i)
he or she will not continue as an employee or director of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time or (ii) he or she has been notified
by Parent that his or her employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
shall continue for a commercially reasonable period following the Effective
Time so as to facilitate integration and then terminate (each, a "Cashed-Out
Company Stock Option"), shall be canceled

 



4

    

 and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for
such cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cashed-Out Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cash-out Price over (B) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock of such Cashed-Out Company Stock Option less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Cashed-Out Company Stock Option that has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the
Equity Award Cash-out Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Equity
Award Cash-out Price" means an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Price.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Company Restricted Stock Award" and, together with the Company Stock
Options, the "Company Equity Awards") shall fully vest and shall be converted
into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. Parent shall pay or issue the
consideration described in this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_ within five (5)
business days following the Effective Time. Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Restricted Stock Awards
all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the IRC or any
provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax law.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
and/or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(c)_, including delivering written notice to each
holder of a Company Equity Award of the treatment of such award pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ and taking reasonable steps to obtain each such
holders written acknowledgement and agreement of the treatment set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.12_, in each case not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the Closing and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at or
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that, other than as set forth herein, from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Stock Plans" means the Company
2008 Equity Compensation Plan, the Company 2013 Equity Compensation Plan, the
Blue Ridge Bank 2008 Stock Option Plan and the Amended and Restated Monument
Bank 2006 Stock-Based Incentive Plan.

 

1.13 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent may specify that the
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be revised and
the parties shall enter into such alternative transactions as Parent may
reasonably determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement;  _provided,
however,_ that such revised structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount
or kind of

 



5

    

 the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) adversely limit or
impact the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the IRC. In the event that Parent elects to
make such a revision, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to
reflect the revised structure.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

2.1 Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
certificates, or evidence of shares in book entry form, representing Company
Common Stock ("Old Certificates"), for exchange in accordance with this
ARTICLE II, (a) certificates, or at Parents option, evidence of shares in
book entry form, representing the Parent Common Stock ("New Certificates"), to
be given to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.5_ and this ARTICLE II in exchange for outstanding shares of such Company
Common Stock, and (b) any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_ (such New Certificates and cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent,  _provided_ that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, or as otherwise
directed by Parent.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, a letter
of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration which such holder shall have become
entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, _Section_ __ _
1.5(a)_, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate(s) shall have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends
or distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. From and
after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate(s) for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Old
Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Merger Consideration to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to, _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_, and (ii)
any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate(s) pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.5(b)_ and (3) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, and the Old
Certificate(s) so surrendered

 



6

    

 shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates or
any dividends payable under  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(b) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the
account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to
the transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing such Company
Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Exchange
Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Old Certificates in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. Subject to the effect
of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, upon the surrender
of such persons Old Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive
any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which
subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect
to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such persons Old
Certificates.

 

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of
Company Common Stock other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock
that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old
Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(e) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or any proceeds from any investments thereof that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the
written request of Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_
shall look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate
thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 



7

    

(f) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Companys
stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Old Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of the Company Common Stock such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the IRC or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

(h) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange
Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share of
Company Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which is owned by a holder who (i) shall have voted
such shares against the Merger, and (ii) pursuant to Maryland Code Annotated,
Fin. Inst. Section 3-718 et seq. (the "Dissenters Rights Statutes"), duly and
validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but, instead,
the holder thereof, with respect to such Dissenting Shares, shall be entitled
to payment in cash from Parent of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of the Dissenters Rights Statutes. If any
such holder shall have failed to duly and validly exercise or perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights, each share
of Company Common Stock of such holder as to which dissenters rights were not
duly and validly exercised or perfected, or were effectively withdrawn or
lost, shall not be deemed a Dissenting Share and shall automatically be
converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. The Company
will provide Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the
Company for payment of the fair value of shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted

 



8

    

 withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on and received
by the Company pursuant to Dissenters Rights Statutes, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any demands for appraisal under Dissenters Rights Statutes.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value, settle or
offer to settle any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

Except as disclosed in disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
and Parent Bank prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") (which schedule sets forth, among other things, facts,
circumstances and events the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of the representations and
warranties contained in this ARTICLE III, or to one or more of the Companys
covenants contained in ARTICLE V or ARTICLE VI (and making specific reference
to the Section of this Agreement to which they relate); _provided_ , that (x)
no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation
or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (y) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such
item represents a material exception or fact, circumstance or event or that
such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (z)
disclosure in any paragraph of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply
only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it
is reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to
another paragraph of the Company Disclosure Schedule or another Section of
this Agreement), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Parent
Bank as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a state chartered
commercial bank, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct
the business currently being conducted by it. The Company is duly qualified
or licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned
or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, either individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in
this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to the Company,
Parent, Parent Bank or the Surviving Bank, as the case may be, any effect,
event, circumstance, occurrence, development, condition or change that,
either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably
expected to have a material and adverse effect on (i) the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes in laws, rules or
regulations or GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements or interpretations
thereof that apply to financial and/or depository institutions and/or their
holding companies generally, (B) changes in economic conditions affecting
financial institutions generally, 

 



9

    

 including but not limited to, changes in the general level of market
interest rates, (C) actions and omissions of Parent, Parent Bank or the
Company taken with the prior written consent, or at the request, of the
other, (D) direct effects of compliance with this Agreement on the operating
performance of the parties, including expenses incurred by the parties in
investigating, negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (E) changes in national or
international political or social conditions including the engagement by the
United States in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a
national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist
attack upon or within the United States, and (F) a decline in the trading
price of a partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet any
internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions in
respect of revenues, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for any
period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected
to become, a Material Adverse Effect, to the extent permitted by this
definition and not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso) shall not
be considered in determining if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred except,
with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (E), to the extent that the effects of
such change disproportionately affect such party and its Subsidiaries
as compared to comparable U.S. banking organizations) or (ii) the ability of
such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company engages only in activities (and holds properties only of the types)
permitted to Maryland chartered-banks. The Company is an "insured depository
institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and
the applicable regulations thereunder. The deposits of the Company are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid by the
Company when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance
are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

3.2 Subsidiaries.

(a) Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth with respect to
each of the Companys direct and indirect Subsidiaries its name, its
jurisdiction of incorporation, the Companys percentage ownership, the number
of shares of stock or other equity interests owned or controlled by the
Company and the name and number of shares held by any other person who owns
any stock of the Subsidiary. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary"
when used with respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, bank, trust or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is (i) consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes or (ii) directly or indirectly (through one or
more intermediaries) controlled by or owned more than fifty percent (50%) by
such party. The Company owns of record and beneficially all the capital stock
or other equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any
charge, mortgage, pledge, security interest, claim, lien or
encumbrance ("Lien"). There are no contracts, commitments, agreements or
understandings relating to the Companys right to vote or dispose of any
equity securities of its Subsidiaries. The Companys ownership interest in
each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to equity investments by Maryland-chartered banks. There
are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay
dividends or distributions except for restrictions on dividends or
distributions under applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. No Subsidiary of the Company is an
"insured depository institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, as amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder.

 



10

    

(b) Each of Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
conduct the business currently being conducted by it and is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned
or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been
validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No
shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company are or may be
required to be issued by virtue of any options, warrants or other rights, no
securities exist that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
such capital stock or any other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary,
and there are no contracts, commitments, agreements or understandings of any
kind for the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or other debt or
equity security of any Subsidiary or options, warrants or other rights with
respect to such securities.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000 shares
of capital stock, all of which are designated as Company Common Stock.

other rights of any kind to acquire Company Common Stock, other than
the issuance, repurchase, redemption or acquisition of shares of Company

Equity Awards that were outstanding on September 17, 2019 in accordance with
their terms (without amendment or waiver since September 17, 2019) or (ii)
issued or awarded any options, restricted shares or any other equity-based
awards under any of the Company Stock Plans.

 



11

    

(d) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote
on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote are issued or
outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated
debt securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are issued or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not deferring
interest payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or related
junior subordinated debt securities issued by it or any of its affiliates.

the date hereof, there are no outstanding securities or instruments that
contain any redemption or similar provisions, and there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) Other than the Company Equity Awards issued prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities, commitments or agreements of
any character obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any additional
shares of capital stock of the Company (including any rights plan or
agreement) or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, call, right,
convertible security, commitment or agreement. Section 3.3(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all
Company Equity Awards outstanding as of September 17, 2019, specifying, on a
holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the number
of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award, (iii) the grant date of
each such Company Equity Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan under which such
Company Equity Award was granted, (v) the exercise price for each such
Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option, and (vi) the expiration
date of each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option.

 

(g) There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer
of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company. The
Company does not have in effect a "poison pill" or similar stockholder rights
plan (other than any such plan as to which the rights granted thereunder have
expired).

3.4 Authority. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by

 



12

    

 all necessary corporate actions on the part of the Companys Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the
Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has directed that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the
Companys stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such stockholders and has
adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. No other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Requisite Company Vote"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity,
whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity (collectively, the
"Enforceability Exceptions").

 

3.5 No Violations. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming that the consents, approvals and
filings referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.6 _have been obtained and the
applicable waiting periods have expired, violate any law, rule or regulation
or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license (each, a "Law")
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
properties) is subject, (ii) violate the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or the similar organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under
(or an event which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default under), or result in the termination of, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, indenture, deed of
trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or to which any of their
respective properties or assets may be subject, except (in the case of clause
(iii) above) for such breaches, violations, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

3.6 Consents and Approvals. Except for (i) the filing by Parent of
applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") as a bank holding company

validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
There are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, orders or rulings of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any of

that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to

 



15

    

 pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, a
"Company Regulatory Agreement"), nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to the Companys knowledge, orally,
since January 1, 2016, by any Governmental Entity that it is considering

conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016. There is no claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or notice of violation (whether
civil, criminal or administrative) pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against any officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of his or her duties as an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time

Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing disputes,
claims, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings regarding
any material Tax of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for which adequate reserves have not been
established. No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental Entity

taxation by that jurisdiction.

Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described
in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.15(a)_, whether or not set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "Company Contract," and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties
thereto which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each Company
Contract is valid and binding on the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and in full force and effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by it to date under each Company Contract. To the Companys
knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Company Contract has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under such Company Contract, and no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any such Company Contract.

 

3.16 Intellectual Property. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns or
possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to use (in the manner
and the geographic areas in which they are currently used) without payment all
patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, service marks and trademarks
material to its business. With respect to each item of Intellectual Property
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the owner possesses all
right, title and interest in and to the item, free and clear of any Lien. With
respect to each item of Intellectual Property that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, the license, sublicense or
agreement covering such item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation with or of any intellectual
property rights of a third party (including any claims that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any intellectual
property rights of a third party). To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual
property rights of third parties and no third party has interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any
intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means trademarks, service

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries brought by or on behalf of any applicant for
employment, any current or former employee, any person alleging to be a
current or former employee, any class of the foregoing, or any Governmental
Entity, relating to any such Law, or alleging breach of any express or implied
contract of employment, wrongful termination of employment, or alleging any
other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or
has ever been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor organization with respect to its employees, nor is
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding asserting
that it has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it or any
such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and
conditions of employment nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has any such
proceeding been threatened, nor is there any strike, other labor dispute or
organizational effort involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending

insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs
or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plans, programs or arrangements or other contracts or agreements to or with
respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which
together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a "Company ERISA Affiliate"), is a party or
has any current or future obligation or that are maintained, contributed to
or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director
or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Company ERISA Affiliate. Except as set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no announcement or commitment by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to create an additional Company Benefit
Plan, or to amend any Company Benefit Plan, except for amendments required
under _Sections 6.11 and 6.14_ of this Agreement or amendments required by
applicable Law or which do not materially increase the cost of such Company
Benefit Plan.

 

(b) The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of each Company Benefit Plan along with, where applicable,
copies of and the following related documents, to the extent applicable: (i)
the most recent copy of any summary plan descriptions, amendments,
modifications or material supplements to any such Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
the annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two
(2) plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination letter, if

prepared actuarial report for each Company Benefit Plan (if applicable) for
each of the last two (2) years.

 



22

    

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable laws, including ERISA and the IRC. Since January 1, 2016, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective
action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS,
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any
such program.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
litigation, administrative action or proceeding relating to any Company
Benefit Plan. All of the Company Benefit Plans comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the IRC and other
applicable laws. There has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC) with respect to the Company
Benefit Plans that is likely to result in the imposition of any penalties or
Taxes upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 502(i) of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC.

(e) The Company has never sponsored, implemented or participated in any
defined benefit pension plan or multiple-employer plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA.

(f) Section 3.18(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the IRC (a "Company Qualified Plan"). Each Company Qualified Plan
has received a favorable determination letter or a prototype plan or volume
submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS for the most recent
applicable remedial amendment cycle, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such letter.
No Company Qualified Plan is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC).

 

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the IRC) and any award thereunder,
in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the IRC, has (i) since January
1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since
January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the IRC. Except as set forth
in Section 3.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company Benefit
Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA that is not qualified under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the IRC
is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded plan that
is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for
a select group of management or highly compensated employees, pursuant to
Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA and the Company has filed
a "top hat" registration letter with the Department of Labor for each such
plan.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
post-retirement or post-employment benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
that cannot be amended or terminated upon sixty (60) days notice or less
without incurring any liability thereunder, except for coverage required by
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the IRC, or similar state
laws, the cost of which is borne by the insured individuals.

(i) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full, or to the extent not required to
be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected in the
financial statements of the Company. Each Company Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded
through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund"
within the meaning of Section 419 of the IRC or (B) is unfunded.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness
to, any employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or
limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit
Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC.

(k) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the IRC, or otherwise. The Company has
made available to Parent preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations
(whether or not final), which to the best of its knowledge are true, correct
and complete, with respect to any disqualified individual who is a "named
executive officer" of the Company as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

3.19 Real Property. Other than real properties classified as OREO, Section
3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all real property owned by or
leased to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not occupied and
including any leases assigned or leased premises sublet for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries remains liable. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (a) has good and marketable title to each parcel of real property
identified on Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as owned by it
(the "Company Owned Properties"), free and clear of all material Liens,
except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real
property Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) easements, rights of way, 

 



24

    

 and other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value or
use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or
otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties and (iv)
such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially
affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties (collectively, "Permitted Encumbrances"), and (b) is the lessee of
all leasehold estates identified on Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as being leased to it (the "Company Leased Properties" and,
collectively with the Company Owned Properties, the "Company Real Property"),
free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to Companys knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened condemnation proceedings against the Company
Real Property. Each lease pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as lessee, leases any Company Leased Property is valid and in
full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other party to any such lease, is in
default or in violation of any material provisions of any such lease. To the
knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures or other
improvements located on any Company Real Property encroaches upon or over any
adjoining parcel or real estate or any easement or right-of-way.

 

3.20 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the Company has received the
opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed
by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P.
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio (as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_) in the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock. Such opinion has not
been amended or rescinded in any material respect as of the date of this
Agreement.

3.21 Fees. Other than for financial advisory services performed for the
Company by Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P., pursuant to a letter agreement,
a true and complete copy of which has previously been provided to Parent,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees,
commissions or finders fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.22 Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have complied, with
all Laws relating to: (i) the protection or restoration of the environment or
natural resources, (ii) the handling, storage, use, presence, disposal,
release or threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or
(iii) noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution, contamination or any
injury to persons or property from exposure to any hazardous substance

arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, or investigations of any
nature pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, before any
court, governmental agency or board or other forum against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries seeking to impose, or that 

 



25

    

 could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any
Environmental Law and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or investigation.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice, demand letter, executive or administrative order, directive or
request for information from any Governmental Entity or any third party
indicating that it may be in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental

applicable Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the "Company Data"), against any unauthorized
or improper use, access, transmittal, interruption, modification or
corruption, except where the failure to have in place such policies and
procedures has not had and would not, either individually or in the

Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable

foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or

Exchange Act will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for such portions
thereof that relate only to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The information supplied, or to
be supplied, by Parent for inclusion in applications to Governmental Entities
to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be accurate in all material respects.

4.23 Internal Controls.

 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability
for assets, and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization.

 



42

    

(b) Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (y) has identified and disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to
Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that
Parents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(c) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent,
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to
any director or officer of Parent.

4.24 Tax Treatment of the Merger. Parent has not taken any action, and has no
knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to it, that would prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the IRC.

4.25 Data Privacy. Parent its Subsidiaries have in place commercially
reasonable data protection and privacy policies and procedures to protect,
safeguard and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and security of (i)
their information technology systems and (ii) all information, data and
transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby, including
personally identifiable information, financial information, and credit card
data (as such information or terms are defined and/or regulated under
applicable Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the "Parent Data"), against any unauthorized or
improper use, access, transmittal, interruption, modification or corruption,

 



43

    

 except where the failure to have in place such policies and procedures has
not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable federal and state
confidentiality and data security Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines
of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency including, without
limitation, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security
program adopted by Parent pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364, and all industry
standards applicable to the Parent Data, including card association rules and
the payment card industry data security standards, except where such failure
to be in compliance has not had and would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Except as has not had and would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent, there currently are not any, and since January 1, 2016, have not been
any, pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened, claims or written
complaints with respect to unauthorized access to or breaches of the security
of (i) any of the Parents or its Subsidiaries information
technology systems or (ii) Parent Data or any other such information
collected, maintained or stored by or on behalf of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries (or any unlawful acquisition, use, loss, destruction, compromise
or disclosure thereof).

ARTICLE VI

 

COVENANTS

 

6.1 Acquisition Proposals.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate
or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries,
discussions or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any
information or data regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an
inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations, or otherwise communicate in any way with any
person (other than Parent, Parent Bank or Representatives of Parent or Parent
Bank), regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ by
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, it may,
and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives
to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and
participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board
of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
, that, prior to furnishing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided by the prior sentence, the Company shall have provided such
information to Parent and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no more favorable to such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company.

 



49

    

(b) As used in this Agreement,

 

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect to, or
third party indication of interest in, any of the following (other than the
transactions contemplated hereunder): (1) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (2) any acquisition or purchase, direct
or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Companys
consolidated assets or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company in a single transaction or
series of transactions; (3) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company; and

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written offer or proposal made
by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal that the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) (1) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not
less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company; (2) would result in
a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of
Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
than the consideration to be paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant
to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the
consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other
risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond, or in
addition to, those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (3) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with
respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal and the substance thereof, including, in each case, the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the material terms
and conditions thereof, and shall provide to Parent any written materials
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith.
The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
advise Parent of any developments, discussions or negotiations with respect to
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including any amendments to or
revisions of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

  



50

    

(d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality agreements or standstill agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with
the terms thereof. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

6.2 Advise of Changes. Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly advise
the other party orally and in writing to the extent that it has knowledge of
(i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

6.3 Access to Information.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party
such reasonable access (i) during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation Tax Returns), contracts, properties, personnel and to such other
information relating to itself and its Subsidiaries as the other party may
reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that no investigation pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party in this Agreement, and (ii)
during and, as reasonably required, outside of normal business hours, to
telecommunications, data processing and related electronic information
systems, facilities and personnel of Parent and the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries for the purpose of performing activities related to
the Data Conversion. No party shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the entity in possession or control of such information or
contravene any Law, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will
make appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) All information and documents obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ be held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the provisions of confidentiality set forth in a letter agreement, dated
August 15, 2019 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). 

 



51

    

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

(d) From and after the date hereof, Representatives of Parent and the Company
shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries data processing and related electronic
informational systems (the "Data Conversion") to those used by Parent and its
Subsidiaries with the goal of conducting such conversion as soon as
reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Merger. Parent and
the Company agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
commence preparations for implementation of the Data Conversion, and
to cooperate in preparing for the Data Conversion, including by providing
reasonable access to data, information systems and personnel having expertise
with their and their respective Subsidiaries information and data systems,
discussions of the possible termination by the Company of third-party service
provider arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter,
non-renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used by the
Company in connection with its systems operations, retention of outside
consultants and additional employees to assist with the Data Conversion, and
outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided system services;
_provided, however_ , that neither party shall be required to terminate any
third-party service provider arrangements prior to the Effective Time or take
any other action that would prejudice or adversely affect in any material
respect its rights under any such arrangements or contracts in the event the
Closing does not occur. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company on
request, or pay directly, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or
charges that the Company may incur as a result of taking, at the request of
Parent, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the Data
Conversion.

6.4 Applications; Consents.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days after
the date hereof) all necessary applications, notices and filings to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities
that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger). The Company and
Parent shall furnish each other with all information concerning themselves,
their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective Subsidiaries directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any application, notice or filing
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other on, all the information relating to Parent and the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_. In exercising the

 



52

    

 foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Each party will provide the other with
copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to
filing, other than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that
contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information
filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. The
parties hereto agree to consult with each other, coordinate and use
their reasonable best efforts to timely prepare or cause to prepare all
notifications required by applicable Law relating to any branch closings that
will occur after the Effective Time with respect to which notice is required
to be given prior to the Effective Time. Each party shall consult with the
other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, shall give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall, and they shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization or
approval of any third party that is required to be obtained in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Antitakeover Provisions. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
Parent and the Company and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

6.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to do promptly,
or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible,
including using efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
extensions, waivers, consents and approvals from all applicable Governmental
Entities, effecting all necessary registrations, applications and filings
(including, without limitation, filings under any applicable state securities
laws) and obtaining any required contractual consents and regulatory
approvals.

  



53

    

6.7 Publicity. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, and (b) to ensure
that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan. Except in respect of any announcement required by (i)
applicable Law, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an obligation
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange,
Parent and the Company agree to consult with each other and to obtain the
advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the
extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees that
neither it nor any Subsidiary shall issue any communication of a general
nature regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to employees
(including general communications relating to benefits and compensation)
without prior consultation with Parent and, to the extent relating to post-
Closing employment, benefit or compensation information, without the prior
consent of Parent or issue any communication of a general nature to customers
without the prior approval of Parent.

6.8 Stockholder Meetings. 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent Meeting" and the "Company
Meeting," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Parent Vote and the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting
of stockholders to approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and
on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of
Parent and the Company, as the case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the
case of Parent, and the Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company,
including by communicating to its respective stockholders its recommendation
(and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they
approve (i) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the
case of the Company (the "Company Recommendation") and (ii) the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, in the case of
Parent. The Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of the
Company relating to the Requisite Company Vote.

 

(b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
(A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) or refuse
to make the Company Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse
or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) cause or permit Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or related
to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the
terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, prior
to the date of the Company Meeting, the Companys Board of Directors may take
any of the actions specified in item (i) of the preceding sentence (a 

 



54

    

 "Company Subsequent Determination") after the third (3rd) business day
following Parents receipt of a written notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from the Company (A) advising that the Companys Board of
Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 6.8(b)_ or from an action by a representative of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that would have been such a breach if committed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that
the Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in
respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its
affiliates that the Company proposes to accept), (B) specifying the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the party making, such Superior
Proposal, and (C) containing an unredacted copy of the relevant transactions
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, if, but only if, (X)
Parent does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to
negotiate with the Company, within three (3) business days of receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal, a written offer that the Companys Board of
Directors determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal, and (Y) the Companys Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law and that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal
has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior
Proposal after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Company Recommendation or the making of a Company Subsequent Determination by
the Company Board of Directors shall not change the approval of the Companys
Board of Directors for purposes of causing any takeover laws to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

(c) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Parent or the Company, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Company
Vote, as the case may be, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall continue to
use all reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to
solicit proxies from its stockholders in order to obtain the Requisite Parent
Vote and the Requisite Company Vote, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, each of the Parent Meeting and the Company Meeting
shall be convened, and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders
of each of Parent and the Company at the Parent Meeting and the Company
Meeting, as applicable, for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote
and the Requisite Company Vote, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to relieve Parent or the Company of such obligation.

 



55

    

6.9 Registration of Parent Common Stock.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (but in no
event later than seventy-five (75) days after the date hereof), Parent and
the Company shall prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall file the
Form S-4 with the SEC, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as
a prospectus. The Company will furnish to Parent the information required to
be included in the Form S-4 with respect to the Companys business and affairs
and shall have the right to review and consult with Parent and approve the
form of, and any characterizations of such information included in, the Form
S-4 prior to its, or any amendment or supplement thereto, being filed with the
SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent will cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, any comments on or correspondence related to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 from the SEC, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party hereto and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
by Parent with the SEC and disseminated by the Company and Parent to their
respective stockholders.

(b) Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Merger and each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders
of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall notify The Nasdaq Stock Market
of the additional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent in
exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

6.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice to
the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other communication relating to,
a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract material to
the financial condition, properties, businesses or results of operations of
each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or
occurrence which individually or in the aggregate has, or

 



56

    

 which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence,
is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice
or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of all persons who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is not
specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing
Employee") that, in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the
employee benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries;
_provided, however,_ in no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, nor
shall the Parent or its Subsidiaries be obligated to maintain any current
Parent or Subsidiary compensation and benefit plan, arrangement or policy.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions and any
necessary amendments providing that the Companys health and welfare plans as
set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule will be terminated effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time (or such later date as requested by
Parent or as may be required to comply with any applicable advance notice or
other requirements contained in such plans) and shall arrange for termination
of all corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related
arrangements effective on the same date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall
terminate under any of the Companys health and welfare plans prior to the
time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries and their dependents and,
consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in coverage.
Continuing Employees who become covered under health plans, programs and
benefits of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid under the Companys health plan for the plan
year in which coverage commences under Parents health plan. Terminated
Company employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Parent in accordance with the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

(c) For purposes of vesting and determination of eligibility to participate
under Parents compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies (other
than any plan that is frozen as to participation), each Continuing Employee
who is eligible to participate in such plans, programs or policies shall
receive credit for service with the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , for
the avoidance of any doubt, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
(x) that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service or (y) prohibited under Parents
compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies. Continuing Employees
shall not receive prior service credit for benefit accrual purposes under any
of Parents compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies, except for
Parents paid time off program.

 



57

    

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to terminate
the Companys 401(k) plan effective as of the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. Upon
termination of the 401(k) plan all participants will be 100% vested in their
account balances. If requested in writing by Parent, the Company will also
take all necessary steps to file or cause to be filed all necessary documents
with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the Companys
401(k) plan. The Company shall, or shall direct the fiduciaries of the
Companys 401(k) plan to (to the extent permitted by law), provide Parent and
its counsel with a draft of each resolution, amendment, participant
communication or other document relating to the termination of the Companys
401(k) plan at least five (5) business days before such document is adopted,
distributed or filed, and no such document shall be adopted, distributed or
filed without Parents approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall take any and all actions as may be
required to permit the Continuing Employees to roll over their account
balances (excluding loans) in the Companys 401(k) plan into Parents 401(k)
plan. 

(e) Parent agrees that each full time Company employee who is involuntarily
terminated by Parent (other than for cause as determined by Parent) within
twelve (12) months of the Effective Time and who is not covered by a separate
severance, change in control, or employment agreement shall, upon executing an
appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by Parent, receive a
severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the
termination date) for each year of service at the Company, with a minimum
payment equal to four (4) weeks of base pay for Company employees who have
one (1) full year or less of service as of their date of termination and a
maximum equal to twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay. For purposes of
calculating the number of years of service, fractional years of service shall
be rounded up or down to the nearest full year, except for purposes of
determining eligibility to receive a severance payment. For purposes of
calculating base pay, Company employees who are paid on an hourly basis shall
be deemed to have a base pay equal to the employees average weekly
compensation over the two months prior to the termination date. For employees
whose compensation is determined in whole or in part on the basis of
commission income, "base pay" shall include base salary or total hourly wages
paid plus commissions earned during the most recent twelve (12) months ended
as of the date of termination of employment.

 

Any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who has or is a party
to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement
or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for any severance payment
that may be triggered by termination of employment in connection with the
Merger or the Merger alone, shall not receive the severance benefits as
provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(e) _but will receive the payment
specified in such agreement, unless said agreements are terminated in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. __

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Bank, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Bank, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of

 



58

    

 its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
Without limiting the generality of the first sentence of _Section_ __ _
9.12_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any person, including without limitation any current or former
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any
spouse or dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(g) Effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance, change in control and other compensation agreements and
arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
employees, which are not terminated in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all accrued and vested
benefit obligations through the Effective Time which are between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their current or former directors,
officers, employees or consultants.

6.12 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and any
person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another
corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other
entity or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent such
person would have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses pursuant to the Companys Articles of Incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted by applicable Law, and
Parent and the Surviving Bank shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides a signed written undertaking to repay
such advances if the person is not entitled to mandatory indemnification and
it is ultimately determined that such person has not met the relevant standard
of conduct.

 



59

    

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  _Section_
__ _ 6.12(a)_, upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. Any failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under  _Section_ __ _
6.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy with respect to claims against such
persons arising from facts or events occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend annually pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(c)_ more than two
hundred percent (200%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance (the "Premium Cap") and, if Parent is unable to maintain
such policy as a result of this proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available by payment of such amount; _provided
further_ , that Parent may (i) request the Company to obtain an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor "tail"
policies the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such persons than the Companys
existing insurance policies as of the date hereof if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap. 

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such
case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such
successor and assign of Parent and its successors and assigns assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her representatives.

6.13 Litigation and Claims. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Plan of Bank Merger
or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or
to be taken by Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with
respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



60

    

6.14 Company Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") the Board of Directors of Company will adopt
resolutions or take other actions as may be required to (i) cause the exercise
(as of no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the
Effective Time occurs) of any outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP,
(ii) provide that no further purchase periods or purchase rights will be
available under the ESPP from and following ten (10) Business Days

indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of the Companys outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees,
securities, and other agreements.

6.16 Corporate Governance. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
(i) increase the size of its Board of Directors to fifteen (15) members, (ii)
appoint two (2) current members of the Board of Directors of the Company who
qualify as "independent" under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock

(iii) nominate one (1) additional current member of the Board of Directors of
the Company who qualifies as "independent" under the listing standards of the

stockholders to replace a retiring director or, if the Effective Time shall
not have occurred prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for such
meeting, immediately following Parents 2020 annual meeting of stockholders,
appoint one (1) such member of the Board of Directors of the Company to fill
a vacancy on the Parent Board of Directors to serve until the next annual

Nominating Committee shall determine so that the number of directors in each
class is as nearly equal as possible. Thereafter, Parent will apply its normal
governance and nomination procedures to the re-election of incumbent
directors.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

 

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger abandoned,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the
Board of Directors of the terminating party, either before or after the
obtainment of the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Company Vote:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; or

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if (i) the Company shall have failed to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or at
any adjournment thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken or (ii) if Parent shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote
at the duly convened Parent Meeting or at any adjournment thereof at which a
vote on the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger was taken; or

 



64

    

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if either (i) any approval, consent or
waiver of a Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied and such
denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, in the event that the Merger is not
consummated by the first anniversary of this Agreement, unless the failure to
so consummate by such time is due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein; or

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the party seeking
termination is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), in the event of a breach of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the other party shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_ or _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b),_ as the case may be,
would not be satisfied and such breach or untrue representation or warranty
has not been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written
notice to the party committing such breach or making such untrue
representation or warranty; or

 

(f) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent, or resolved to do so, or failed to
reaffirm such recommendation within two (2) business days after Parent
requests in writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against
acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company Common
Stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an affiliate
of Parent) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender
or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms
hereof, (ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
breached its obligations under _Sections 6.1_ or _6.8_ in any material
respect; or

 

(g) By the Company, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (as defined below) (the "Parent Ratio") shall be less than 0.80; and

(ii) (x) the Parent Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each
as defined below) and subtracting 0.15 from the quotient in this clause (ii)
(y) (such number in this clause (ii) (y) being referred to herein as the
"Index Ratio");

 



65

    

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If the Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, it
shall give written notice to Parent (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Parent shall have the option to increase the consideration to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the
lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio
(as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded
to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of
the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Parent
Ratio. If Parent so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt
written notice to the Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
8.1(g)_ and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

 

For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:

 

"Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of Parent Common Stock
as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Determination
Date.

 

"Determination Date" shall mean 10th day prior to the Closing Date, provided
that if shares of the Parent Common Stock are not actually traded on The
Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on such day, the Determination Date shall be the
immediately preceding day to the 10th day prior to the Closing Date on which
shares of Parent Common Stock actually trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC.

"Final Index Price" shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the 20
consecutive full trading days ending on the Determination Date.

"Index Price" shall mean the closing price on such date of the NASDAQ Bank
Index.

 

"Starting Date" shall mean the last trading day immediately preceding the date
of the first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.

"Starting Price" shall mean the closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source) on the
Starting Date.

 

8.2 Termination Fee.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee in the amount of $17,500,000 (the "Termination Fee")
within two (2) business days of the date of termination.

 

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made known to senior management or the Board of
Directors of the Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders
generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (i) (A) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i)_

 



66

    

 or pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ without the Requisite Company Vote
having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, and (ii) prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination
Fee; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent
(25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2 _are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, then such non-paying party shall pay the costs and
expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the non-paying party
fails to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, then the
non-paying party shall pay interest on such overdue amount (for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in
full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan
Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such
payment was originally required to be made. The amounts payable pursuant to
_Sections 8.2(a)_ and  _8.2(b_ ) constitute liquidated damages and not a
penalty and, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the
sole remedy of the party receiving such payment in the event of termination of
this Agreement on the bases specified in such sections under circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and there shall be
no liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or Representatives, except that (i)
_ Sections 6.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, this _Section_ __ _ 8.3 _and
ARTICLE IX, shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the documents and
instruments referred to herein, together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to
the transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes any and all other oral or
written agreements heretofore made.

 

9.11 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



70

    

9.12 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified Party and
his or her heir and representatives, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice
or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 

9.14 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.15 Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the
use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to
deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto
forever waives any such defense.
