upon the achievement of certain milestones set forth in, and subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of, the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _CVR Agreement_ "),
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
(iii) should the approval of Milans shareholders be required by applicable
Law, determined to recommend, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, that the shareholders of Milan vote to approve this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including: (x) the allotment

Depositary of Milan Depositary Shares; and (z) the grant of Milan CVRs to the

C. The HoldCo Board has (i) determined that the Contemplated Transactions are
fair to, advisable, and in the best interests of HoldCo and its sole

Transactions.

D. The Merger Sub Board has (i) determined that the Contemplated Transactions
are fair to, advisable, and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole
stockholder, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the

and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that the
stockholder of Merger Sub vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve the
Contemplated Transactions.



   

E. The Company Board has (i) determined that the Contemplated Transactions are
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions and (iii) determined to recommend, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that the
stockholders of the Company vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to Milans willingness to enter into this Agreement,
the officers and directors of the Company listed on Section A of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the Company)
are executing support agreements in favor of Milan in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the " _Company D andO Support Agreements_"),
and the stockholders listed on Section A of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are also executing support agreements in favor of Milan (the " _Stockholder
Support Agreements_ " and, together with the Company DandO Support Agreements,
the " _Company Stockholder Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which such
Persons have, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, agreed
to vote all of their shares of Company Capital Stock (i) in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and thereby approve the Contemplated Transactions,
(ii) in favor of any resolutions directly or indirectly put by the Company to
its shareholders to give effect to the Contemplated Transactions, including,
but not limited to, the Required Company Stockholder Vote, and (iii) against
any competing proposals.

offer to which the UK City Code applies or agreeing to accept any such offer.

 

AGREEMENT

 

The Parties, intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, agree
as follows:

SECTION 1\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company
will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



2

    

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. As a result of
the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo and
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Milan.

 

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ , _7_ and
_8_ , the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California
94025, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ , _7_ and _8_ , other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or at
such other time, date and place as Milan and the Company may mutually agree
in writing. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to
as the " _Closing Date_." At the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by executing and filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger,
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL and in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective at the time of the filing of such Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be specified in such Certificate of Merger with the consent of Milan and the
Company (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time:

 

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in the Merger to read as set forth on Exhibit A to the
Certificate of Merger, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and
such certificate of incorporation;

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to the bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such bylaws;

 

(c) the directors and officers of Milan, each to hold office in accordance
with the articles of association of Milan, shall be as set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_; and

(d) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, shall be the directors and officers of Milan as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, after giving effect to the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_.

 



3

    

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Milan, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the Company or
any equityholder of the Company or Milan:

(i) any shares of Company Capital Stock held as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

(ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, each share of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i)_ and excluding Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted (and shall cease to exist) solely into the right to
receive (A) Milan Depositary Shares, representing a number of Milan Ordinary
Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Share Consideration_ "), and (B)
one Milan CVR (together with the Share Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or the CVR Agreement, the number of Milan
Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued by Milan to the Depositary (and the
corresponding number of Milan Depositary Shares to be issued by the
Depositary) as Merger Consideration or pursuant to the CVR Agreement shall
not, in the aggregate, exceed sixty-six point sixty-seven percent (66.67%) of
the Milan Outstanding Shares (the " _Share Consideration Cap_ "), and (i) if
the aggregate number of Milan Ordinary Shares underlying the Milan Depositary
Shares to be issued at Closing would otherwise exceed the Share Consideration
Cap, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted so that the Share
Consideration Cap is not exceeded and (ii) if, at any time following the
Closing, the aggregate number of Milan Depositary Shares to be issued pursuant
to the CVR Agreement would require the allotment and issuance of an aggregate
number of Milan Ordinary Shares (underlying such Milan Depositary Shares)
that, together with the aggregate number of Milan Ordinary Shares underlying
the Milan Depositary Shares issued at Closing pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Total Share Consideration_ "), would otherwise exceed
the Share Consideration Cap, then the number of Milan Depositary Shares to be
issued pursuant to the CVR Agreement shall be appropriately reduced so that
the Total Share Consideration does not exceed the Share Consideration Cap.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Share Consideration Cap shall have no effect
on any contingent cash payment which is or becomes payable pursuant to the CVR
Agreement.

 

(b) No fractional Milan Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional Milan Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs shall be issued. Any
fractional Milan Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs resulting from the
application of the Exchange Ratio as described in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_
or the settlement of Company Options as described in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Milan Depositary Share or Milan
CVR, as applicable, with no cash being paid for any fractional Milan
Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs eliminated by such rounding.

(c) All Company Options and Company RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Plan shall be treated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

 



4

    

(d) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence
ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or Milan Ordinary
Shares underlying the Milan Depositary Shares shall have been changed into,
or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares or other like change, the Exchange Ratio
shall, to the extent necessary, be equitably adjusted to reflect such change
to the extent necessary to provide the holders of Company Capital Stock,
Company Options, Company RSUs and Milan Depositary Shares with the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or other like change; _provided_ , _ however_ , that
nothing herein will be construed to permit the Company or Milan to take any
action with respect to Company Capital Stock, Milan Ordinary Shares or Milan
Depositary Shares, respectively, that is prohibited or not expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a)
all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_,
and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further
transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock
Certificate_ ") is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in _Sections_ _1.5_ and _1.8_.

1.7 Calculation of Net Cash.

 

(a) Not more than ten (10) nor less than five (5) calendar days prior to the
anticipated date for Closing (as mutually agreed in good faith by Milan and
the Company) (the " _Anticipated Closing Date_ "), the Company will deliver to
Milan a schedule (the " _Net Cash Schedule_ ") setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the Companys good faith estimated calculation of Net Cash (the "
_Net Cash Calculation_ " and the date of delivery of such schedule, the "
_Delivery Date_ ") as of 8:00 p.m. (New York City Time) on the last Business
Day prior to the Anticipated Closing Date (the " _Cash Determination Time_
"), prepared and certified by the Companys chief executive officer and chief
financial officer (or if there is no chief financial officer at such time,
the principal financial and accounting officer for the Company). The Company
shall promptly and fully make available to Milan, (i)(A) a copy of the
accounting system detailed nominal ledger code balances as of the last
practical date prior to the Delivery Date (which date shall be not earlier
than (1) the last day of the calendar month ending immediately prior to the
Delivery Date and (2) the date that is five (5) days prior to the Delivery
Date), and (B) an extended trial balance detailing a reconciliation between
the nominal ledger balances and the Net Cash Schedule, together with all work
papers and back-up materials used or useful in preparing the Net Cash
Schedule, including (1) third party certified copies of all cash, cash
equivalents and investment balances, identified by the institution where such
cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are held, (2) schedules of all
accruals and prepayments, together with calculations and supporting
documentary evidence therefor, (3) a detailed aged receivables report, (4)
working papers and documentary evidence for each other nominal code included
within the Net Cash Schedule, and (5) as reasonably requested by Milan, all
other work papers and back-up materials used or useful in preparing the Net
Cash Schedule, (ii) a detailed bridge (the " _Net Cash Bridge_ ")
reconciling, in daily increments, each of the elements of the Net Cash
Calculation as of the Delivery Date with the Net Cash Calculation as of the
Cash Determination Time, including a schedule describing in reasonable
detail all material assumptions and other inputs underlying such bridge, and
(iii) if requested by Milan, the Companys accountants and counsel at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.

 



5

    

(b) Within three (3) calendar days after the Delivery Date (the last day of
such period, the " _Response Date_ "), Milan shall have the right to dispute
any part of the Net Cash Calculation by delivering a written notice to that
effect to the Company (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Any Dispute Notice shall
identify in reasonable detail and to the extent known the nature and amounts
of any proposed revisions to the Net Cash Calculation.

 

(c) If, on or prior to the Response Date, Milan notifies the Company in
writing that it has no objections to the Net Cash Calculation or, if prior to
8:00 p.m. (New York City Time) on the Response Date, Milan has failed to
deliver a Dispute Notice as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_, then the Net
Cash Calculation as set forth in the Net Cash Schedule shall be deemed to
have been finally determined for purposes of this Agreement and to represent
the Net Cash at the Cash Determination Time (the " _Final Net Cash_ ") for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) If Milan delivers a Dispute Notice on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City
Time) on the Response Date, then Representatives of the Company and Milan
shall promptly, and in no event later than one (1) calendar day after the
Response Date, meet and attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed item(s)
and negotiate an agreed-upon determination of Net Cash, which agreed upon Net
Cash amount shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of
this Agreement and to represent the Final Net Cash for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(e) If Representatives of the Company and Milan are unable to negotiate an
agreed-upon determination of Final Net Cash pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.7(d)_ within two (2) calendar days after delivery of the Dispute Notice (or
such other period as the Company and Milan may mutually agree upon), then any
remaining disagreements as to the calculation of Net Cash shall be referred
to Grant Thornton LLP or another independent auditor of recognized national
standing mutually agreed upon by the Company and Milan (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). The Company shall promptly deliver to the Accounting Firm all work
papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Net Cash Schedule, and the
Company and Milan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to make its determination within five (5) calendar days of
accepting its selection. Milan and the Company shall be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any material related to the
unresolved disputes and to discuss the issues with the Accounting Firm;
__provided__ , _however_ , that no such presentation or discussion shall occur
without the presence of a Representative of each of Milan and the Company. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be limited to the disagreements
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination of the amount of Net Cash
made by the Accounting Firm shall be made in writing delivered to each of the
Company and Milan, shall be final and binding on the Company and Milan
and shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of this
Agreement and to represent the Final Net Cash for purposes of this Agreement.
The Parties shall delay the Closing until the resolution of the matters
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(e)_. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Company and Milan in the same
proportion that the disputed amount of the Net Cash that was unsuccessfully
disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears
to the total disputed amount of the Net Cash amount and such portion of the
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm borne by the Company and any other
fees, costs or expenses incurred by the Company following the Delivery Date
in connection with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(e)_
shall be deducted from the final determination of the amount of Net Cash. If
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(e)_ applies as to the determination of the Final
Net Cash described in _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_, upon resolution of the matter
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(e)_, the Parties shall not be
required to determine Net Cash again even though the Closing Date may occur
later than the Anticipated Closing Date, except that either the Company or
Milan may request a redetermination of the Final Net Cash if the Closing
Date is more than twenty (20) calendar days after the Anticipated Closing
Date.

1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a) Within 45 days from the date hereof, Milan shall appoint Citibank, N.A. or
one of its Affiliates or, if Citibank N.A. and its Affiliates shall refuse to
act, one or more banks or trust companies or other independent financial
institutions (each of which institution and appointment shall be subject to
the written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as: (i) depositary under the Deposit
Agreement (the " _Depositary_ ") in connection with the issuance of Milan
Depositary Shares, and (ii) exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") pursuant to an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent,
which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations
of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) Milan shall allot, issue and deposit with the
Depositary (or its designee), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, such number of Milan Ordinary Shares as is equal to the
Milan Depositary Shares issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_, inter
alia, in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock and (ii) the Depositary
shall issue the Milan Depositary Shares comprising the Share Consideration.
The Merger Consideration, and amounts paid and Milan Ordinary Shares issued
pursuant to the CVR Agreement, are in consideration of the cancellation of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the issue of 999 further
shares by HoldCo to Milan.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Parties shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Milan may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent); and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent or Milan: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number
of whole book-entry Milan Depositary Shares, and (ii) the number of Milan
CVRs, in each case that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(c)_, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Milan may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the delivery of any Milan Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an applicable affidavit with respect to such Company Stock Certificate and
post a bond indemnifying Milan against any claim suffered by Milan related to
the lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate or any Milan
Depositary Shares or Milan CVRs issued in exchange therefor as Milan may
reasonably request.

 



7

    

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Milan
Depositary Shares, or Milan Ordinary Shares underlying such Milan Depositary
Shares, with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
Milan Depositary Shares that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or provides
an affidavit of loss or destruction in lieu thereof in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_ (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to
receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

 

(e) Any Milan Depositary Shares that remain undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is 180 days after the Closing
Date shall be delivered to Milan or a person nominated in writing by Milan
upon demand and may be cancelled, and any holders of Company Stock
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ shall thereafter
look only to Milan for satisfaction of their claims for Milan Depositary
Shares and any dividends or distributions with respect to Milan Depositary
Shares. If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered prior to
the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the Merger Consideration, or any dividends or
distributions, as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 1.8(d)_, to which such
Company Stock Certificate would otherwise entitle its holder would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Company Stock Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Milan, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto, and no consideration or compensation shall be payable
therefor.

(f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Milan and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from
such consideration under the Code or under any other applicable Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, and remitted to the
appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

 



8

    

(g) No Party shall be liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or
to any other Person with respect to any Milan Depositary Shares (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) or for any cash amounts delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or similar Law.

 

1.9 Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
described in  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ attributable to such Dissenting Shares.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by them in accordance with the
DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the DGCL. All
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
shares of Company Capital Stock under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to be
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration attributable to such Dissenting
Shares upon their surrender in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

(b) The Company shall give Milan prompt written notice of any demands by
dissenting stockholders received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served on the Company and any material
correspondence received by the Company in connection with such demands. The
Company shall not, without Milans prior written consent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.

 

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of the Company, then the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized, and shall use their and its
commercially reasonable efforts (in the name of the Company, in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take
such action.

SECTION 2\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.13(h)_, except as set forth in the written

standing (to the extent applicable in such jurisdiction), under the laws of

a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company does not have, and has never had, any Subsidiaries and the
Company does not own any capital stock of, or any equity, ownership or profit
sharing interest of any nature in, or controls directly or indirectly, any
other Entity. The Company is not and has not otherwise been, directly or
indirectly, a party to, member of or participant in any partnership, joint

duly executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Milan, HoldCo and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Prior
to the execution of the Company Stockholder Support Agreements, the Company

(c) The Company Board has taken and will take all actions necessary to ensure
that the restrictions applicable to business combinations contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL are, and will be, inapplicable to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Support

SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (as the case may be)
and, to the Companys Knowledge, as of the time they were filed, none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The certifications and statements
required by (i) Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act and (ii) 18 U.S.C. §1350
(Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) relating to the Company SEC Documents
(collectively, the " _Company_ ___Certifications_ ") are accurate and complete
and comply as to form and content with all applicable Laws. As used in this

construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and
except that the unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and
are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are not
reasonably expected to be material in amount) applied on a consistent basis
unless otherwise noted therein throughout the periods indicated; and (iii)
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows of the Company for the periods covered thereby. Since January 1,
2016, other than as expressly disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof, there has been no material change in the Companys
accounting methods or principles that would be required to be disclosed in
the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The books of
account and other financial records of the Company are true and complete in
all material respects.

 



13

    

(c) The Companys auditor has at all times since the date of enactment of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act been: (i) a registered public accounting firm (as
defined in Section 2(a)(12) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); (ii) to the Knowledge
of the Company, "independent" with respect to the Company within the meaning
of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act; and (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, in compliance with subsections (g) through (l) of Section 10A of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board thereunder.

(d) The Company has not received any comment letter from the SEC or the staff
thereof or any correspondence from Nasdaq or the staff thereof relating to the
delisting or maintenance of listing of the Company Common Stock on Nasdaq. The
Company has not disclosed any unresolved comments in the Company SEC
Documents.

(e) Since January 1, 2016, there have been no formal internal investigations
regarding financial reporting or accounting policies and practices discussed
with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer (or other principal financial and accounting
officer), or general counsel of the Company, the Company Board or any
committee thereof, other than ordinary course audits or reviews of accounting
policies and practices or internal controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 

(f) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and
governance rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

(g) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that the Company maintains
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Companys
transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, (iii) that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iv) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
Companys financial statements. The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q (or any amendment thereto) its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. The Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors
and the Audit Committee of the Company Board (and made available to the
Company a summary of the significant aspects of such disclosure) (A) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, the Company has not
identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.

 



14

    

(h) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the Company Certifications.

 

2.8 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth on Section 2.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, between the date of the Company Unaudited Interim
Balance Sheet and the date of this Agreement, the Company has conducted its
business only in the Ordinary Course of Business (except for the execution and

Adverse Effect. The Company has not received since January 1, 2016, any
written notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise), whether from
a Governmental Authority, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges
that the Company is not in compliance with any Environmental Law and, to the

4.3 Access and Investigation.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which the Parties
agree will continue in full force following the date of this Agreement, and
any requirements of applicable Law, during the Pre-Closing Period, upon
reasonable notice, Milan, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Partys
Representatives to: (a) provide the other Party and such other Partys
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to such
Partys Representatives, personnel and assets and to all existing books,
records, Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating
to such Party and its Subsidiaries; (b) provide the other Party and such other
Partys Representatives with such copies of the existing books, records, Tax

there is no chief financial officer at such time, the principal financial and
accounting officer for the relevant Party) and other officers and managers of
such Party responsible for such Partys financial statements and the internal
controls of such Party to discuss such matters as the other Party may deem
necessary. Any investigation conducted by either Milan or the Company pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other Party.

 



46

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
4.3_, no access or examination contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ shall
be permitted to the extent that it would require any Party or its Subsidiaries
to waive the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege, or
violate any applicable Law; _provided_ , that such Party or its Subsidiary (i)
shall be entitled to withhold only such information that may not be provided
without causing such violation or waiver, (ii) shall provide to the other
Party all related information that may be provided without causing such
violation or waiver (including, to the extent permitted, redacted versions of
any such information), and (iii) shall enter into such effective and
appropriate joint-defense agreements or other protective arrangements as may
be reasonably requested by the other Party in order that all such information
may be provided to the other Party without causing such violation or waiver. 

4.4 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Each of Milan and the Company agrees that, during the Pre-Closing Period,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it or any of its
Subsidiaries authorize any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly:
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate the
communication, making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry or take any action that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish any non-
public information regarding such Party to any Person in connection with or
in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and _Section_ __ _
5.3_); or (v) execute or enter into any letter of intent or any Contract
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction; _provided_
, _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section_ __ _
4.4_ and subject to compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, prior to the
approval of this Agreement by a Partys equityholders ( _i.e._ , the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, in the case of the Company, or the Required Milan
Shareholder Vote, in the case of Milan), such Party may furnish non-public
information regarding such Party and its Subsidiaries to, and enter into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal by such Person which such Partys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with such Partys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Offer (and is not withdrawn) if: (A) neither
such Party nor any Representative of such Party shall have breached this
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_ in any material respect, (B) the board of directors of
such Party concludes in good faith having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the duties or obligations of the board of directors of such
Party under applicable Law; and (C) such Party receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions (including
nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions, non-solicitation provisions and no
hire provisions) at least as favorable to such Party as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any
Representative of such Party takes any action that, if taken by such Party,
would constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ by such Party, the
taking of such action by such Representative shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ by such Party for purposes of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall require Milan to take
any action, or prevent Milan from taking any action, with respect to which the
UK Takeover Panel determines, or which Milan reasonably determines, having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that the taking of such action, or
the failure to take such action, as applicable, is inconsistent with or in
breach of Milans obligations under the UK City Code. Nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall require the Company to take any action, or prevent
the Company from taking any action, if the Company reasonably determines,
having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that the taking of such
action, or the failure to take such action, as applicable, is inconsistent
with or in breach of the Companys obligations under the DGCL.

 



47

    

(b) If any Party or any Representative of such Party receives an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry at any time during the Pre-Closing Period,
then such Party shall, subject to any regulatory obligations of such Party
under applicable Law, promptly (and in no event later than one Business Day
after such Party becomes aware of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry) advise the other Party orally and in writing of the receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 

(c) Each Party shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions, negotiations and communications with any Person that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry as of the date of this
Agreement and request the destruction or return of any nonpublic information
provided to such Person.

 

4.5 Notification of Certain Matters. During the Pre-Closing Period and subject
to any regulatory obligations of such Party under applicable Law, each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Milan, on the other hand, shall promptly notify
the other (and, if in writing, furnish copies of) if any of the following
occurs: (a) any notice or other communication is received from any Person
alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with any of the Contemplated Transactions; (b) any Legal Proceeding against or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party or its Subsidiaries is commenced,
or, to the Knowledge of such Party, threatened against such Party or, to the
Knowledge of such Party, any director, officer or Key Employee of such Party;
(c) such Party becomes aware of any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by such Party in this Agreement; or (d) the failure of such
Party to comply with any covenant or obligation of such Party; in each case
that could reasonably be expected to make the timely satisfaction of any
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ , _7_ and _8_ , as applicable,
impossible or materially less likely. No such notice shall be deemed to
supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Milan Disclosure
Schedule for the purpose of (x) determining the accuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company or Milan in this Agreement
or (y) determining whether any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_, _7_
or  _8_ has been satisfied. Any failure by either Party to provide notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ shall not be deemed to be a breach for
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _8.2_ , as applicable, unless such
failure to provide such notice was knowing and intentional.

SECTION 5\. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

5.1 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Milan and
the Company shall jointly prepare a draft of the registration statement on
Form F-4 (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the
"Form F-4") and a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting
to be held in connection with the Merger (together with any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") included therein (such Proxy
Statement and the Form F-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
collectively, the "Registration Statement"). Once such draft is in a form
reasonably acceptable to all Parties, (i) the Company shall file with the SEC
(as part of the Registration Statement) the Proxy Statement relating to the
Company Stockholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger, (ii)
Milan, in cooperation with the Company, shall file with the SEC the
Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
Milan Depositary Shares (and the Milan Ordinary Shares underlying such Milan
Depositary Shares) to be issued by virtue of the Merger, (iii) to the extent
necessary, Milan shall cause the Depositary to prepare and file with the SEC,
no later than the date prescribed by the rules and regulations under the
Securities Act, a registration statement, or pre-effective or post-effective
amendment thereto, as applicable, on Form F-6 (the "Form F-6") with respect to
the registration under the Securities Act of the Milan Depositary Shares to
be issued by virtue of the Merger and the change in Milans SEC reporting
status, and (iv) Milan, in cooperation with the Company, shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form 8-A relating to the
registration under the Exchange Act of Milan Depositary Shares to be issued by
virtue of the Merger. Each of Milan and the Company shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause the Registration Statement
to become effective as promptly as practicable, (B) promptly notify the other
of, cooperate with each other with respect to, and respond promptly to, any
comments of the SEC or its staff, and (C) take all or any action required
under any applicable federal, state, securities and other Laws in connection
with the issuance of Milan Depositary Shares pursuant to the Merger. Each of
the Parties shall furnish all information concerning itself and their
Affiliates, as applicable, to the other Parties as the other Parties may
reasonably request in connection with such actions and the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Milan shall prepare any
prospectus, admission or listing document or other similar document with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions required to be filed or published by
or on behalf of Milan under applicable foreign Law as promptly as
practicable after the requirement to prepare such document is notified by
Milan to the Company, such notification to be made promptly after the receipt
of legal advice by Milan that the preparation of such document is required
under applicable foreign Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing herein shall require Milan to register the Milan CVRs with
the SEC or obtain the listing of the Milan CVRs on any national securities
exchange or market.

 



49

    

(b) Milan covenants and agrees that the Registration Statement (and the letter
to shareholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy included therewith) and
any information supplied by or on behalf of Milan or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion in the Registration Statement will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company
covenants and agrees that the information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company to Milan for inclusion in the Registration Statement (including the
Company SEC Documents) will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make such information, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Milan, or any of
their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Milan
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form F-4 or the
Proxy Statement, so that the relevant document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Milan makes
no covenant, representation or warranty with respect to statements made in the
Registration Statement (and the letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and
form of proxy included therewith), if any, based on information provided by
the Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion therein.

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. If Milan, Merger Sub or the Company become aware of any event
or information that, pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Proxy Statement, as the case may be, then such Party, as the case
may be, shall promptly inform the other Parties thereof and shall cooperate
with such other Parties in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC
and, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment or supplement to the Companys
stockholders.

 

(d) The Company and Milan shall reasonably cooperate with each other and
provide, and cause each of their respective Representatives to provide, to
the other Party and its Representatives, such true, correct and complete
information regarding the Company or Milan, as the case may be, that is
reasonably requested by the other Party, or as may be required by Law or
appropriate for inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Form
F-6, or (iii) any prospectus, admission or listing document or other similar
document with respect to the Contemplated Transactions required to be filed
or published by or on behalf of Milan under applicable foreign Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of Milan and the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply, and cause such Partys independent accounting
firm to supply, to the other Party, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter, all information
and schedules reasonably requested by the other Party to prepare consolidated
pro forma financial information as required in connection with the
Registration Statement or any prospectus, admission or listing document or
other similar document with respect to the Contemplated Transactions required
to be filed or published by or on behalf of Milan under applicable foreign
Law.

_Company Stockholder Meeting_ "). The Company Stockholder Meeting shall be
held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, and in any event no later than forty-five
(45) days after the effective date of the Registration Statement. The Company
shall take reasonable measures to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance
with all applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if on the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or a date preceding
the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company
reasonably believes that (i) it will not receive proxies sufficient to
obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum would
be present or (ii) it will not have sufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (whether in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company may
postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Company Stockholder Meeting as long as the date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an
aggregate of 30 calendar days in connection with any postponements or
adjournments.

(b) The Company agrees that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ and _Section_

stockholders vote to approve the Company Stockholder Matters and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit such approval within the time
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ (the recommendation of the Company Board
that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt and approve this
Agreement being referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "); and
(ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified (and
the Company Board shall not publicly propose to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation) in a manner adverse to Milan, and no resolution
by the Company Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Milan or to adopt, approve
or recommend (or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend) any

_ 5.2_, if at any time prior to the approval of the Company Stockholder
Matters by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a bona
fide written Superior Offer, the Company Board may withhold, amend, withdraw
or modify the Company Board Recommendation (or publicly propose to withhold,
amend, withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation) in a manner
adverse to Milan (collectively, a " _Company Board Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") if, but only if, following the receipt of and on account of such
Superior Offer, (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend,
withdraw or modify such recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company
has, and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to,
during the Notice Period (as defined below), negotiate with Milan in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, and
(iii) if after Milan shall have delivered to the Company a written offer to
alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during the Notice Period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (after taking into account such alterations of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement); _provided_ that (x) Milan
receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board has
determined to change its recommendation at least four (4) Business Days in
advance of the Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change (the " _Notice
Period_ "), which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of
the reasons for such Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change, and written
copies of any relevant proposed transaction agreements with any party making a
potential Superior Offer; (y) during any Notice Period, Milan shall be
entitled to deliver to the Company one or more counterproposals to such
Acquisition Proposal and the Company will, and request its Representatives to,
negotiate with Milan in good faith (to the extent Milan desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that the applicable Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Offer; and (z) in the event of any material amendment to any Superior Offer
(including any revision in the amount, form or mix of consideration
the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of such potential
Superior Offer), the Company shall be required to provide Milan with notice of
such material amendment and the Notice Period shall be extended, if
applicable, to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain in the
Notice Period following such notification during which the parties shall
comply again with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ and the
Company Board shall not make a Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change
prior to the end of such Notice Period as so extended (it being understood
that there may be multiple extensions).

 

(d) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any
Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from complying with duties owed under applicable Law.

otherwise required in connection with the issuance or trading of the Milan
Depositary Shares, including (i) the issuance of the Milan Depositary Shares
and the allotment and issuance of the Milan Ordinary Shares underlying the
Milan Depositary Shares to be issued in the Merger, and (ii) the grant of the
Milan CVRs to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Milan Shareholder Matters_ " and such meeting,
the " _Milan Shareholder Meeting_ "). The Milan Shareholder Meeting, if so
required, shall be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, and in any event no
later than forty-five (45) days after the effective date of the Registration
Statement. Milan shall take reasonable measures to ensure compliance with
applicable Law in connection with the convening and holding of the Milan
Shareholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if on the date of the Milan Shareholder Meeting, or a date preceding
the date on which the Milan Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Milan reasonably
believes that (i) it will not receive proxies sufficient to obtain the
Required Milan Shareholder Vote, whether or not a quorum would be present or
(ii) it will not have sufficient Milan Ordinary Shares represented (whether in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Milan Shareholder Meeting, Milan shall promptly inform the Company and
may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Milan Shareholder Meeting as long as the date of
the Milan Shareholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an
aggregate of 30 calendar days in connection with any postponements or

effect that the Milan Board recommends that Milans shareholders vote to
approve the Milan Shareholder Matters (the recommendation of the Milan Board
being referred to as the " _Milan Board Recommendation_ "); and (iii) the
Milan Board Recommendation shall not be withheld, amended, withdrawn or
modified (and the Milan Board shall not publicly propose to withhold, amend,
withdraw or modify the Milan Board Recommendation) in a manner adverse to the
Company, and no resolution by the Milan Board or any committee thereof to

_Milan Board Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, and subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ and _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, at any time prior to the approval of the Milan Shareholder Matters
by the Required Milan Shareholder Vote, Milan receives a bona fide written
Superior Offer, the Milan Board may make a Milan Board Adverse Recommendation
Change if, but only if, following the receipt of and on account of such
Superior Offer, the Milan Board determines in good faith, having consulted
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Milan Board Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) the Company

Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer; and (z) in the event of any
material amendment to any Superior Offer (including any revision in price or
percentage of the combined company that Milans shareholders would receive as
a result of such potential Superior Offer), Milan shall be required to
provide the Company with notice of such material amendment and the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2)
Business Days remain in the Notice Period following such notification during
which the parties shall comply again with the requirements of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(c)_ and the Milan Board shall not make a Milan Board Adverse
Recommendation Change prior to the end of such Notice Period as so extended

(d) Milans obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Milan Shareholder

Milan Board from complying with duties owed under applicable Law.

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested, shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive, subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, (i)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise
price of such canceled Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such excess will be determined by
subtracting from the Share Consideration a number of Milan Ordinary Shares
equal to the quotient of the aggregate exercise price applicable to the
Company Option divided by the Milan Dollar VWAP. For the avoidance of doubt,
each Company Option that has a per-share exercise price that is higher than
the Merger Consideration (each, an " _Underwater Option_ ") shall be canceled

shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of
Company RSUs subject to such award. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the tax withholding obligations for each holder receiving shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be
satisfied by the Company withholding from issuance that number of shares of
Company Common Stock calculated by multiplying the maximum statutory
withholding rate for such holder in connection with such issuance by the

such withholding in cash to the appropriate Tax Authority.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may

the ESPP to: (i) cause the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) ongoing
as of the date of this Agreement to be the final Offering Period under the
ESPP and the options under the ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (x) the

5.8 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, each of Milan and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of Milan or the Company, respectively (the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the DandO Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of Milan
or of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. Each DandO Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from each of Milan and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, upon receipt by Milan or the Surviving Corporation from the DandO
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any such person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to Milan, to the extent
then required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



55

    

(b) The provisions of the articles of association of Milan with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and officers of Milan that are presently set forth in the
articles of association of Milan shall not be amended, modified or repealed
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were officers or directors of Milan, unless such modification
is required by applicable Law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Milan shall cause the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers as those
presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its DandO
Indemnified Parties as of immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to any
indemnification provisions under the Companys Organizational Documents and
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and such DandO
Indemnified Parties, with respect to claims arising out of matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Milan shall fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of Milan to its DandO Indemnified Parties as
of immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to any indemnification

Effective Time.

prepaid "DandO tail policy" for the non-cancellable extension of the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions or in connection with the Companys initial public
offering of shares of Company Common Stock).

 



56

    

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Milan shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that are incurred by the persons referred to in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ in connection with their enforcement of the rights
provided to such persons in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and
directors of Milan and the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or
agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

(g) In the event Milan or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Milan or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_. Milan shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to consummate the

disclosure in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed; or (b) such Party shall have determined in good faith,
upon the advice of outside legal counsel (to the extent practicable or
permissible under applicable Law to delay such disclosure by seeking such
advice), that such disclosure is required by applicable Law and, to
the extent practicable and permissible under applicable Law, before such
press release or disclosure is issued or made, such Party advises the other
Party of, and consults with the other Party regarding, the text of such press
release or disclosure;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to applicable
Law, each of the Company and Milan may make (i) any public statement in
response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls and (ii)
any disclosure to any other third party, including, without limitation, to
employees, customers or vendors of such Party, in each case, so long as any
such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by the Company or Milan in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

entries or certificates evidencing any Milan Depositary Shares to be received
in the Merger by equityholders of the Company who may be considered

Act reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 and 145 and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for such Milan
Depositary Shares.

5.13 Directors. Until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in accordance with applicable Law, the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts and take all necessary action so that the Persons listed in _Schedule_
_5.13_ are elected as directors of Milan to serve in such positions effective
as of the Effective Time. If any Person listed in _Schedule_ _5.13_ is unable
or unwilling to serve as a director of Milan, the Party appointing such Person
(as set forth on _Schedule _ _5.13_ ) shall designate a successor (which
shall, in case the Company is appointing such Person, be reasonably acceptable
to Milan). For the avoidance of doubt the Parties intend, and shall take all
necessary corporate action to cause, effective as of the Closing, that (i)
the board of directors of each of Milan and the Surviving Corporation shall be
expanded to ten persons and (ii) the two vacancies created by such expansion
shall be filled by two persons designated by the Company (and reasonably

prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) and (ii) the Deposit Agreement to be duly authorized, executed
and delivered by and among Milan, the Depositary, and all holders and
beneficial owners of Milan Depositary Shares issued thereunder. If the TIGIT
Milestone (as defined in the form of the CVR Agreement set forth on Exhibit B)
has occurred prior to the Effective Time, then each Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the other Party to amend the CVR Agreement accordingly. For
the avoidance of doubt, such amendments would delete all TIGIT-related

references to any of the foregoing from the CVR Agreement such that no TIGIT
Milestone Payment (as defined in the form of CVR Agreement set forth on
Exhibit B) would be payable thereunder.

(g) The Parties agree that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the payment of

sole and exclusive remedy of each Party following a termination of this
Agreement under the circumstances described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, it
being understood that in no event shall either Milan or the Company be
required to pay the individual fees or damages payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ on more than one occasion. Subject to _Section_ __ _
9.2_, following the payment of the fees and expenses set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ by a Party, (i) such party shall have no further
liability to the other Party in connection with or arising out of this
Agreement or the termination thereof, any breach of this Agreement by the
other Party giving rise to such termination, or the failure of the
Contemplated Transactions to be consummated, (ii) no other Party or their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim,
action or proceeding against such Party or seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind against such Party (or any partner, member,
equityholder, director, officer, employee, Subsidiary, affiliate, agent
or other representative of such Party) in connection with or arising out of
this Agreement or the termination thereof, any breach by such Party giving
rise to such termination or the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be
consummated and (iii) all other Parties and their respective Affiliates shall
be precluded from any other remedy against such Party and its Affiliates, at
law or in equity or otherwise, in connection with or arising out of this

consummated. Each of the Parties acknowledges that (x) the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the
Contemplated Transactions, (y) without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement and (z) any amount payable pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Parties in the circumstances in
which such amount is payable.

 



65

    

(h) The Parties intend and shall use all reasonable endeavors to secure that
any sum paid under _Sections_ _9.3(b)_ - _9.3(f)_ (a " _Termination Payment_
"), if paid, being compensatory in nature, shall not be treated for VAT
purposes as consideration for a taxable supply. If, however, the
Termination Payment is treated by any Tax Authority, in whole or in part, as
consideration for a taxable supply, then (i) if it is determined by a Tax
Authority to be consideration for a taxable supply in respect of which any
recipient of the Termination Payment (or the representative member of the
group of which any recipient of the Termination Payment is a member) is liable
to account for VAT, to the extent that such VAT is recoverable by the payor of
the Termination Payment (or the representative member of the group of which
the payor is a member) by repayment or credit, the amount of the Termination
Payment shall be increased to such amount so that the amount of the relevant
fee (including any amount in respect of VAT) less the amount of such
repayment or credit equals the amount of the Termination Payment had no such
VAT arisen; for the avoidance of doubt if and to the extent that such VAT is
irrecoverable by the payor (or the representative member of the group of which
the payor is a member) then no additional amount shall to that extent be paid
in respect of such VAT and the Termination Payment shall, to that extent, be
VAT inclusive; and (ii) if a Tax Authority determines that VAT is due from the
payor of the Termination Payment (or the representative member of the group
of which the payor is a party) under the reverse charge mechanism or under any
similar mechanism outside the European Union, to the extent that any VAT
chargeable on the supply is not recoverable by such payor (or the
representative member of the group of which the payor is a member) by
repayment or credit, the amount of the Termination Payment shall be reduced to
such amount so that the aggregate of the Termination Payment and such
irrecoverable reverse charge VAT equals the amount of the relevant fee had no
such irrecoverable reverse charge VAT arisen. Such adjusting payment as may be
required between the Parties to give effect to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_
shall be made five (5) Business Days after the date on which the determination
by the Tax Authority has been communicated to the party required to make the
payment (together with such evidence of it as is reasonable in the
circumstances to provide and, where subparagraph (i) applies, together with
the provision of a valid VAT invoice) or, if later (in the case of
subparagraph (i)) five (5) Business Days after the VAT is recovered or
(in the case of subparagraph (ii)) five (5) Business Days before the VAT is
required to be accounted for.

Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

by the other Party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to

10.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to

provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.
In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior

provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve,
to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 

10.11 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and each of the Parties waives any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other Party with respect thereto.

 

10.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
