iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") made and entered into as
of the 15th day of May, 2003, between and among ARVEST HOLDINGS, INC., an
Arkansas corporation ("AHI") and AHI ACQUISITION, INC., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AHI ("ACQUISITION"); and SUPERIOR FINANCIAL
CORP., a Delaware corporation ("TARGET").



W-I-T-N-E-S-S-E-T-H



WHEREAS, the authorized capital stock of ACQUISITION consists of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("ACQUISITION Common"), all
of which are validly issued and outstanding;



WHEREAS, the authorized capital stock of TARGET consists of 20,000,000 shares
of common stock, par value $.01 per share ("TARGET" Common"), of which
8,281,509 shares are validly issued and outstanding and 1,800,383 shares are
held as treasury stock by TARGET and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $.01, none of which have been issued; __



WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Boards
of Directors of AHI, ACQUISITION and TARGET, have approved the merger (the
"Merger") of ACQUISITION into TARGET, pursuant to which each outstanding share
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of TARGET shall be converted into
the right to receive cash, as more fully set forth herein and determined that
the Merger is in the best interest of the parties and their stockholders; and



WHEREAS, Acquisition has been formed by AHI for the sole purpose of acquiring
TARGET by consummating the merger and as such, Acquisition has conducted
no business, has no operating assets or liabilities and its separate
existence will cease upon completion of the merger;



WHEREAS, in furtherance of the consummation of the Merger, the parties hereto
desire to enter into this Agreement;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE ITHE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS



1.1 _Merger_. At the Closing (as defined in Section 1.4), ACQUISITION and
TARGET shall effect the Merger, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
pursuant to which ACQUISITION shall be merged with and into TARGET which shall
be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). Certain terms in
this Agreement are defined in Section 9.1 of this Agreement. 



At the Effective Time:



(a) the outstanding shares of ACQUISITION Common shall, by virtue of the
merger and without further action of the holder thereof, be converted into and
become 1000 shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation par value
$1.00 per share;



(b) subject to Sections 1.1(c) and 1.2, each outstanding share of TARGET
Common shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part
of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, be cancelled and retired and
cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive in cash,
without interest, $23.75 per share, from the Surviving Corporation in the
manner provided herein;



 

A-1 (c) each share of TARGET Common held in the treasury of TARGET shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without further action, cease to exist and all
certificates representing such shares shall be canceled;



(d) ACQUISITION will provide funds sufficient to pay the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation set out in Section 1.1(b) above. AHI will provide such
funds and will cause ACQUISITION to perform its obligations under this Section
1.1(e).



1.2 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of TARGET Common that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the Dissenters Statute shall not be converted into the
right to receive cash a provided in Section 1.1(b), but rather the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Statute; provided,
however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the Dissenters Statute,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive cash as provided in
Section 1.1(b). TARGET shall give AHI and ACQUISITION prompt notice upon
receipt by TARGET of any written demand for appraisal pursuant to the
Dissenters Statute, and will keep AHI and ACQUISITION apprised of all details
relating to all such demands including but not limited to informing them of
the names of all shareholders demanding appraisal, the number of shares owned
by such shareholders and the dates of their respective demands, and AHI shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands for appraisal. TARGET agrees that, prior to the
Effective Time, it will not, except with the prior written consent of AHI and
ACQUISITION, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demand.



1.3 _Payment and Cancellation of Options_. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of TARGET (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the TARGET stock plans) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
adjust the terms of all outstanding options to acquire TARGET Common, whether
vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each
such option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and the holder thereof (as designated on _Schedule 2.2_ previously
delivered to AHI by TARGET) shall then become entitled in full satisfaction of
such cancellation to receive, following the Effective Time, a single lump sum
cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of
the per share price described in Section 1.1(b) above over the exercise price
per share of such option, and (2) the number of shares of TARGET Common
for which such option shall not theretofore have been exercised. Following
the Effective Time, AHI shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay all amounts
payable to holders of such options pursuant to the preceding sentence, which
shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid
without interest. Prior to the Effective Time, TARGET shall ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of any option to acquire TARGET Common
or any participant in any TARGET stock plan or TARGET Plans shall have any
right thereunder to acquire capital stock of TARGET or the Surviving
Corporation.



1.4 _Closing; Closing Date; Filing of Merger Documents; Best Efforts_.
Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger herein
contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article VIII, a closing
(the "Closing") will be held as soon as practicable, on a date mutually agreed
upon, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after all conditions hereto
shall have been satisfied or waived, as appropriate. The Closing shall be held
at the offices of Hilburn, Calhoon, Harper, Pruniski and Calhoun, Ltd., North
Little Rock, Arkansas or as otherwise agreed by the Parties, beginning at
9:00 a.m. on the same date that the Effective Time occurs, unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties (the "Closing Date"), at which time and place the
documents referred to in Articles VI and VII hereof will be exchanged by the
parties hereto and, immediately thereafter, a Certificate of Merger shall be
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. TARGET, AHI and ACQUISITION agree
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to perform all obligations and
comply with all covenants and conditions to be performed or complied with by
them hereunder and to cause the transactions contemplated herein to be
effectuated as soon as reasonably possible.



 

A-2 1.5 _Effect on Shares_. After the Effective Time, each shareholder of
TARGET shall be entitled, upon surrender of certificates representing shares
of TARGET Common accompanied by a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal in the form to be sent to all such shareholders (as provided in
Section 1.6 hereof) to the paying agent, which shall be the Registrar and
Transfer Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, (the "Paying
Agent") to receive in substitution therefor, an amount determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of TARGET Common surrendered by (ii) the
amount set forth in Section 1.1(b). If outstanding certificates for shares of
TARGET Common are not surrendered or the cash payment therefor not claimed
prior to three (3) years after the Effective Time (or, in any particular
case, prior to such earlier date on which such cash payments would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency), the
unclaimed amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



1.6 _Paying Procedures_. (a) As soon as practical after the Effective Time,
and in no event later than five (5) days thereafter, the Paying Agent shall
mail and otherwise make available to each person who, as of the Effective
Time, was the record holder of one or more shares of TARGET Common, a form
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such certificate or certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such certificate or certificates to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the persons entitled thereto in cash an
amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of TARGET Common
represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered by (ii) the
amount set forth in Section 1.1(b) less any transfer taxes, if any, payable in
connection therewith. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender of such certificates.

 



(b) If payment is to be made to a person other than the one in whose name
a surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment either
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such transfer or
other taxes have been paid or are not applicable.



(c) Each of the Paying Agent, AHI and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of former holder of
TARGET Common such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.6, neither
the Paying Agent, AHI, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall
be liable to a holder of shares of TARGET Common for any amount properly paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.



1.7 _Certificate Surrender_. Immediately after the Effective Time and upon
surrender by AHI of the certificate representing the ACQUISITION Common owned
and held by AHI, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to AHI an appropriate
certificate or certificates representing the New Common created by the
conversion of the ACQUISITION Common in the Merger.



1.8  _Lost or Stolen Certificate_. In the event that any certificates for
TARGET Common shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, together with such other documents required under Section 1.6
above; provided, however, that the Paying Agent, may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of cash, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates to



 

A-3  deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against AHI, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.



1.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession
to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of TARGET
and ACQUISITION, the officers and directors of AHI and the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of ACQUISITION, TARGET,
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such necessary action.



1.10 _Continued Existence_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided by the applicable provisions of Section 259 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time: the
separate existence of ACQUISITION shall cease; the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all assets and property of every description, and every
interest therein, wherever located, and the rights, privileges, immunities,
powers, franchises and authority, of a public as well as of a private nature,
of each of the Constituent Corporations; all obligations belonging to or due
each of the constituent Corporations shall be vested in, and become the
obligations of, the Surviving Corporation without further act or deed; title
to any real estate or any interest therein vested in either of the
Constituent Corporations shall not revert or in any way be impaired by reason
of the Merger; all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of
either of the Constituent Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired; and
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all the obligations of each of
the Constituent Corporations and any claim existing, or action or proceeding
pending, by or against either of the Constituent Corporations may be
prosecuted to judgment, with right of appeal, as if the Merger had not taken
place. __



1.11 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Certificate of Incorporation of
TARGET as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until further
altered, amended or repealed as provided by law.



1.12  _By-Laws_. The By-Laws of TARGET as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation ("By-
Laws") until further altered, amended or repealed as provided by law. 



1.13 _Directors_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time shall be those directors of ACQUISITION in office immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The officers of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time shall be those officers of ACQUISITION in office immediately

1.14  _Registered Office_. The Surviving Corporation shall be governed
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the address of its registered
office in that state shall be c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209
Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of
its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.



ARTICLE IIREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET



TARGET hereby represents and warrants to AHI and ACQUISITION as follows:



2.1. _Corporate Organization, Authorization, etc_. (a) TARGET is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own or lease the
properties and assets it now owns or holds under lease; is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in every other state of the
United States and other jurisdictions where the character of its business or
the nature of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary
except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or  



 

A-4  licensed is not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET. TARGET has full corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, and subject to the approval of
the shareholders as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law and
subject to the approvals described in Section 2.4, to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein and therein; and this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by TARGET and subject to such approvals is a valid
and binding agreement of TARGET in accordance with its terms, subject to Laws
relating to creditors rights generally and, subject to such approvals, the
consummation by TARGET of the Merger has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action. TARGET has heretofore delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION true,
accurate and complete copies of the currently effective Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of TARGET.



(b) As of the date hereof, the Board of Directors of TARGET, by resolutions
duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held under
applicable laws and its articles of incorporation and by-Laws and
not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way ("TARGET Approval"), has
duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein and therein are fair to and in the best interest of TARGET and its
shareholders and declared the Merger to be advisable; (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and therein; and (iii)
recommended that the shareholders of TARGET adopt this Agreement and directed
that such matters be submitted for consideration by TARGETs shareholders at
a special meeting to be duly called and held as soon as practicable. Such
resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to AHI and ACQUISITION, this
Agreement and the Merger the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
General Corporations Law ("Section 203"). The approval of the Merger by the
Board of Directors of TARGET referred to this Section 2.1 constitutes approval
of the Merger for purposes of Section 203 and represents the only action
necessary to ensure that the restrictions on business combinations (as such
term is defined therein) set forth in Section 203 does not and will not apply
to the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. To TARGETs knowledge, no other state take over statute or
similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to TARGET with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger.



2.2 _Authorized and Outstanding Stock_. The authorized capital stock of
TARGET consists of 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. As of May 15, 2003, 10,081,892 shares of TARGET Common were
issued of which 1,800,383 shares of TARGET Common were held as treasury stock
by TARGET and after such date the only additional shares issued or that will
be issued were or will have been pursuant to those stock options described in
_Schedule 2.2_ described below. No shares of preferred stock of TARGET have
been issued. All of such issued shares are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Except as set forth above, TARGET does not have outstanding any
other shares of its capital stock or any other securities or indebtedness
having the right to vote on any matters on which holders of TARGET Common may
vote. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.2_ previously delivered to AHI and
ACQUISITION by TARGET, TARGET does not have outstanding, and is not bound by,
any subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights, "phantom"
stock rights, stock-based performance units, Contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind or agreements to issue any additional shares of its
capital stock or any other securities or indebtedness having the right to
vote on any matters on which holders of TARGET Common may vote, including any
right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security or other
instrument, and TARGET is not obligated to issue any shares of its capital
stock for any purpose. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights or
other rights that are in any way linked to the price of any capital stock of
TARGET. There are not any outstanding contractual obligations of TARGET to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of TARGET Capital Stock.
There are no unsatisfied preemptive rights in respect to the capital stock of
TARGET. As of May 15, 2003, there are outstanding and unexercised options to
purchase a total of 1,222,042 shares of TARGET Common.  _Schedule 2.2_ lists
the name of each optionee holding such outstanding and unexercised options and
includes with respect to each optionee: (a) the number of options granted; (b)
the breakdown of the number of such options which are vested and unvested as
of May 15, 2003; (c) the exercise price; (d) identification of the plan,
agreement or other document under which the options were issued to the
optionee or by which they are governed; and (e) the number of options of the
optionee that are qualified and non-qualified pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code.



 

A-5 2.3 _Subsidiaries, Affiliates, etc_. All subsidiaries of TARGET and
their subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to individually as "Subsidiary" and
collectively as "Subsidiaries") are listed on _Schedule 2.3_ previously
delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET. TARGET owns 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Superior Bank (sometimes herein referred to as
the "Bank Subsidiary"), which is a federal stock savings bank duly organized
and validly existing under the Laws of the United States and applicable
regulations. Each other subsidiary identified on Schedule 2.3 is owned 100%
by its parent as indicated thereon, except with respect to certain REIT
preferred stock redeemable at the price and in the manner set forth in
_Schedule 2.3_. Except with respect to the Subsidiaries so listed and as
disclosed on _Schedule 2.3_ , neither TARGET nor any Subsidiary owns any
material amount of any shares of stock of any corporation or material amount
of any equity interest in a partnership, joint venture or other business
entity, and neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries controls any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity by means of
ownership, management contract or otherwise. Each of the Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction set forth opposite its name in _Schedule 2.3_. Each
Subsidiary has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted and to own or lease the property and assets it now
owns or holds under lease; and is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in every other state of the United States or other
jurisdictions where the character of its business or the nature of its
properties make such qualification or licensing necessary except for such
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on TARGET. Except as listed on _Schedule 2.3_ , none
of the Subsidiaries has outstanding, or is bound by, any subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights, "phantom" stock rights, stock-
based performance units, Contract, arrangements or undertaking of any kind or
agreements to issue any shares of its capital stock or any other securities or
indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which holders of
Subsidiaries common stock may vote, including any right of conversion or
exchange under any outstanding security or other instrument and Subsidiaries
are not obligated to issue any shares of their capital stock for any purpose.
There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights or other rights that are
in any way linked to the price of any capital stock of Subsidiaries. There are
not any outstanding contractual obligations of a Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock; and all shares
of the Subsidiaries are owned by TARGET or one of the Subsidiaries free and
clear of all Liens, equities, claims and options of whatever nature and all
such shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set
forth above, Subsidiaries do not have outstanding any other shares of their
capital stock or any other securities or indebtedness having the right to vote
on any matters on which holder of Subsidiary common stock may vote. There are
no unsatisfied preemptive rights in respect to the capital stock of any the
Subsidiaries. TARGET has previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION true,
accurate and complete copies of the currently effective Articles of
Association, Incorporation and By-Laws or equivalent organizational documents
of each of the Subsidiaries.



2.4  _Consents, Approvals, Filings, etc., of Governmental Authorities_. No
characteristic of TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries, or of the nature of its
or their businesses or operations, requires any Consent, approval
or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any
Regulatory Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except
for (i) approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1467a(e), 1464, 1842 or 1843, and other state and
federal bank, federal savings association and bank holding company regulatory
authorities; (ii) any required filing with Arizona Department of Insurance;
(iii) any required filing or notification with the Department of Justice
and/or Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iv) filing a proxy statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder; and (v)
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
Delaware General Corporation Law.



2.5 _Financial Statements_. 



(a) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 2.5-a_ previously delivered to AHI
and ACQUISITION by TARGET, TARGET has delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION (or
will deliver, when available, with respect



 

A-6  to periods ended after the date of this Agreement) true, correct and
complete copies of the Financial Statements and where applicable are
substantively identical to those contained in the TARGET SEC Reports and
those filed with any other Regulatory Authority.



(b) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 2.5-a_ , such Financial Statements (i)
were prepared from the Records of TARGET; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP (or, where applicable, regulatory accounting principles)
consistently applied throughout the periods involved subject to any exceptions
as to consistency made thereon or as may be indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of unaudited interim consolidated statements, as may be
permitted by the SEC on its Form 10-Q; (iii) fairly and accurately present
TARGETs financial condition and the results of its operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows at the relevant dates thereof and for
the periods covered thereby, except that the unaudited interim Financial
Statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which are not, or are not expected to be, material in amount; (iv) contain or
reflect all necessary material adjustments and accruals for an accurate
presentation of TARGETs financial condition and the results of operations and
cash flows for the periods covered by such financial statements; and (v)
where applicable complied in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC and other Regulatory Authorities.



(c) The allowance for loan losses contained in the Financial Statements
was established in accordance with the past practices and experiences of the
Bank Subsidiary, and the allowance for loan losses shown on the consolidated
balance sheet of TARGET as of March 31, 2003 was, in the aggregate, adequate
in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP (or, if applicable,
regulatory accounting principles) to provide for possible losses on loans as
of the dates of such balance sheets.



2.6 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. TARGET and the Subsidiaries have
no liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise, and whether due or to become due, which were material to TARGETs
consolidated financial position and which were not reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company dated March 31, 2003 (the "March
31, 2003 Balance Sheet") or in the notes thereto as a Liability or by adequate
reserves therefor, which in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles were required to be reflected in such balance sheet or in the
notes thereto as a Liability or by adequate reserves therefor except
liabilities incurred since March 31, 2003 (the "Balance Sheet Date") in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET.



2.7 _Absence of Changes_. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there have been no
changes in the business, results of operations, financial condition or
liabilities (accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), or other occurrences
or events with respect to TARGET and the Subsidiaries which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on TARGET Except as disclosed on _Schedule 2.7_
previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET, since the Balance Sheet
Date, there has not been any change in such business, results of operations,
financial condition or liabilities or occurrence of any events of the type
prohibited in Section 4.2 hereof (as if the restriction in Section 4.2
commenced as of the Balance Sheet Date) except for dividends paid in the
normal course of business.



2.8 _Information Statement, etc_. None of the information to be contained in
the definitive proxy solicitation materials in the form mailed to the
shareholders of TARGET pursuant to Section 5.4 hereof will, at the time of
such mailing, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact or
omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no representation or
warranty is made by TARGET hereunder with respect to any information which is
furnished to TARGET by AHI and/or ACQUISITION for the specific purpose of
inclusion in the definitive proxy solicitation material.



2.9 _No Violation_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 2.9_ previously
delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the performance of the obligations imposed upon TARGET hereunder
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not
constitute or result in a material breach of any term, condition or provision
of, or constitute a Default under, or result in the creation of



 

A-7  any Lien upon any property or assets of TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries
pursuant to (i) any charter or by-law, or (ii) any material agreement or
other instrument to which TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any part of their property is bound, nor will such execution, delivery,
performance or consummation violate any Law, or Order binding upon TARGET or
any of the Subsidiaries, nor will the same result in the loss of, or by their
terms cause a change constituting a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET to any
material license, franchise, certificate, legal privilege or legal right
enjoyed or possessed by TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries, give any party to
any material agreement to which any of them is a party the right of
termination or acceleration or give any lender or noteholder, or any trustee
for any lender or noteholder, any right to accelerate the maturity of, or
increase the rate of interest with respect to, any material indebtedness as to
which TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries is the direct or indirect obligor, or
to claim any Default or breach with respect thereto.



2.10 _Brokerage/Fairness Opinion_. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 2.10_
previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET, no broker or finder has
acted directly or indirectly for TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
no broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or other
commission in respect thereof based in any way on agreements, arrangements or
understandings made by or on behalf of TARGET or of any of the
Subsidiaries. TARGET has received the opinion of Stephens, Inc. dated the
date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the price per
share and the transactions contemplated herein are fair to the shareholders of
TARGET from a financial point of view, a copy of which opinion will be made
available to AHI promptly after the date of this Agreement.



2.11 _Tax Matters_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, TARGET and the
Subsidiaries have filed all federal, state, local and foreign Tax returns
required to be filed ("Returns"), and all Taxes shown by such returns to be
due and payable have been paid or are reflected as a Liability on the March
31, 2003 Balance Sheet, or are disclosed in _Schedule 2.11-a_  previously
delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET. TARGETs federal income tax
returns have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") through
its fiscal year 2001, and all of state, local and foreign tax
authorities have been fully paid or such taxes have been fully reserved for
in the March 31, 2003 Balance Sheet, and, at the date hereof, TARGET has not
given or been requested to give any waiver of any statute of limitations
relating to the payment of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes. The
reserves for Taxes specifically reflected on the March 31, 2003 Balance Sheet
are adequate to cover all federal, state, local and foreign Tax liabilities
payable by TARGET and the Subsidiaries for the period prior to the date of
such balance sheet. TARGET has previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION
copies of the federal income tax returns of TARGET and the Subsidiaries for
each of the periods ended December 31, 2000 and 2001.



(b) TARGET and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time will have
withheld with respect to their employees all federal and state income taxes,
and other Taxes required to be withheld, except such Taxes which are not
material to TARGET.



(c) No audit or other examination of any Returns of TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries by any Tax authority is presently in progress, nor has TARGET
been notified of any request for such an audit or other examination.



(d) No adjustment relating to any Returns filed by TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries has been proposed in writing formally or to TARGETs knowledge
informally by any Tax authority to TARGET or any representative thereof.



(e) Except as described on _Schedule 2.11-e_ previously delivered to AHI
and ACQUISITION by TARGET, there is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement to which TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date of this Agreement, including but not limited to the provisions of this
Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected
to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code. Except as fully
disclosed on  _Schedule 2.11-e_ , there is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement to which TARGET is a party or by which it is bound to compensate
any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.



 

A-8 (f) Neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has filed any consent
agreement under Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2)
of the Code apply to any disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as defined in
Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries. 



(g) Except as described on Schedule 2.11-g previously delivered to AHI and
ACQUISITION by TARGET, neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries (i) has ever
been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax
Return (other than a consolidated group the common parent of which is
TARGET), (ii) is a party to any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement,
arrangement or understanding, (iii) is liable for the Taxes of any other
person under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise,
and (iv) is a party to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement
that could be treated as a partnership for income Tax purposes. 



(h) Neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in
the two years prior to the date of the Agreement or (ii) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger. 



(i) None of TARGETs or the Subsidiaries assets are tax exempt use
property within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code.



2.12 _Employee Benefit Plans._



(a) All employee compensation, incentive, fringe or benefit plans,
programs, policies, commitments, agreements or other arrangements including
golden parachute agreements (whether or not set forth in a written document
and including, without limitation, all "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")) covering any active or former employee, director
or consultant of TARGET ("TARGET Employee" which shall for this purpose mean
an employee of TARGET or an ERISA Affiliate (as defined below)), any
subsidiary of TARGET or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
which is a member of a controlled group or which is under common control with
TARGET within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"),
or with respect to which TARGET has or, to its Knowledge, may in the future
have Liability, are listed in _Schedule 2.12-a_ previously delivered to AHI
and ACQUISITION by TARGET (the "TARGET Plans"). TARGET has provided or will
make available to AHI and ACQUISITION: (i) correct and complete copies of all
documents embodying each TARGET Plan including (without limitation) all
amendments thereto, all related trust documents, and all material
written agreements and contracts relating to each such TARGET Plan; (ii) the
most recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code in connection with each TARGET Plan; (iii) the most recent
summary plan description together with the summary(ies) of material
modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each
TARGET Plan; (iv) all IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory
letters; (v) all material correspondence to or from any governmental agency
relating to any TARGET Plan; (vi) all forms and related notices required under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended ("COBRA"); (vii) the most recent discrimination tests for each TARGET
Plan; (viii) the most recent actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each
TARGET Plan; (ix) if the TARGET Plan is funded, the most recent annual
periodic accounting of the TARGET Plan assets; and (x) all communication to
TARGET Employees relating to any TARGET Plan and any proposed TARGET Plan, in
each case, relating to any amendments, terminations, establishments, increases
or decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting schedules, or
other events which would result in any material liability to TARGET or any
ERISA Affiliate.



(b) Each TARGET Plan has been maintained and administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all Laws (foreign or domestic), including but not limited to ERISA and
the Internal Revenue Code, which are applicable to such TARGET Plans and all
 



 

A-9  Returns that are required to be filed have been filed. No Litigation
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of TARGET
Plan activities) has been brought, or to the Knowledge of TARGET, is
threatened against or with respect to any such TARGET Plan. There are no
audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of TARGET,
threatened by the IRS or Department of Labor (the "DOL") with respect to any
TARGET Plans. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be
made or accrued as of the date hereof to the TARGET Plans have been timely
made or accrued. Any TARGET Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and each trust intended to qualify under
Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (i) has either obtained a
favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter,
as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has
been amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation. No condition or circumstance
exists giving rise to a material likelihood that any such TARGET Plan would
not be treated as qualified by the IRS. TARGET does not have any plan or
commitment to establish any new TARGET Plan, to modify any TARGET Plan (except
to the extent required by law or to conform any such TARGET Plan to
the requirements of any applicable Law, in each case as previously disclosed
to AHI and ACQUISITION in writing, or as required by the terms of any TARGET
Plan or this Agreement), or to enter into any new TARGET Plan. Each TARGET
Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective
Time in accordance with its terms, without liability to AHI and ACQUISITION,
TARGET or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses).



(c) Neither TARGET, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code and at no time has
TARGET contributed to or been requested to contribute to any "multiemployer
plan," as such term is defined in ERISA. Neither TARGET, any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of TARGET or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any material Liability or penalty under Section 4975 through
4980B of the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with
respect to any TARGET Plan which could subject TARGET or its ERISA Affiliates
to material Liability.



(d) None of the TARGET Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other
retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable law,
and neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has represented, promised or
contracted to provide such retiree benefits to any TARGET Employee, former
employee, director, consultant or other person, except to the extent required
by statute.



(e) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, TARGET is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable material foreign,
federal, state and local Laws, respecting employment, employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours.



(f) Except as listed on _Schedule 2.12-f_ previously delivered to AHI
and ACQUISITION by TARGET, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby either
alone or in connection with any other event will (i) result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any stockholder, director or TARGET Employee or any
of the Subsidiaries under any TARGET Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any TARGET Plan, or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits.



2.13 _Property_.



(a) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 2.13_ , previously delivered to AHI
and ACQUISITION by TARGET, TARGET or one of the Subsidiaries has marketable
title to all real property, insurable at standard rates, and good and
indefeasible title to all other assets of TARGET and the Subsidiaries (i)
reflected on the



 

A-10  March 31, 2003 Balance Sheet, (ii) thereafter acquired by TARGET or any of
the Subsidiaries or (iii) owned by TARGET or any Subsidiary at March 31, 2003
but which assets have been written down to zero since that date (except in
each case for assets disposed of since March 31, 2003 in the ordinary course
of TARGETs and the Subsidiaries businesses), free and clear of all Liens
except for Liens for Taxes if such Taxes shall not at the time be due and
delinquent or the same thereafter can be paid without penalty, and such Liens
and imperfections of title, if any, which do not materially interfere with the
present or proposed use of such property or otherwise materially impair the
business operations relating to such property; provided, however, that this
representation and warranty shall not extend to those assets of TARGET and the
Subsidiaries which in the aggregate are not material to the business, results
of operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All real estate owned by TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries, including other real estate owned, is separately listed on
_Schedule 2.13_.



(b) All tangible property and assets of TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries
which are material to the business, results of operations, prospects or
financial condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, have
been well maintained and are in good operating condition and repair, in all
material respects, except for ordinary wear and tear.



2.14 _Additional Schedules Furnished to AHI and ACQUISITION_. In addition
to the Schedules previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION pursuant to
other provisions of this Agreement, TARGET has previously delivered to AHI and
ACQUISITION the following Schedules and true, correct and complete copies of
all items listed on such Schedules:



(a) _ Certain Contracts, Agreements, Licenses_. _ Schedule 2.14-a_
lists as of the date hereof (i) each Contract, including leases, to which
TARGET or any Subsidiary is a party which involves or may involve aggregate
future payments (whether in payment of debt, as a result of a guarantee or

of them of $100,000 or more, other than Contracts which may be canceled on
thirty (30) days notice or less without the payment of any penalty or other
termination fee; (ii) franchise agreements of TARGET or any Subsidiary; (iii)
all material license agreements to which TARGET or any Subsidiary is a party
by which TARGET or any Subsidiary grants, or is granted, any right to

Property; and (iv) each material Contract that restricts (a) the geographical
area in which TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries is permitted to operate or (b)
TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries from engaging in any line of business
within the Financial Services Industry.

Permits and other evidences of authority of any Regulatory Authority, which
Permits and other evidences of authority singly or in the aggregate are
material to the business, results of operations, prospects or financial
condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. TARGET and the
Subsidiaries have all necessary governmental authorizations to own their
properties and assets and to carry on their business, as now being conducted,
the absence of which might have a Material Adverse Effect on the business,
results of operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.



(c) _ Employee Compensation_. _ Schedule 2.14-c_ lists as of the date
hereof the names of and current annual salary rates for all present officers
and employees of TARGET and the Subsidiaries who received $75,000 or more in
aggregate compensation (including bonuses) during the fifty-two weeks ending
December 31, 2002, or are presently scheduled to receive compensation of
$75,000 or more during the fifty-two weeks ending December 31, 2003.



(d) _ Insurance_. _ Schedule 2.14-d_ sets forth as of the date hereof
a list and description of all policies of fire, liability, casualty and other
forms of insurance held by TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries. TARGET and the
Subsidiaries (i) have adequately insured, by financially sound and reputable
insurers, all property of a character usually insured by corporations engaged
in the same or similar business similarly situated, against loss or damage of
the kinds customarily insured against by such corporations, and (ii) carry,
with



 

A-11  financially sound and reputable insurers, such other insurance (including,
without limitation, liability insurance) and in such amounts as is usually
carried by corporations engaged in the same or a similar business, similarly
situated. Neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has been refused any
insurance by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for insurance
during the past five (5) years because of unacceptable risk.



(e) _ Bank Loans_. The loans comprising the loan portfolio of the Bank
Subsidiary have been made in the normal course of business and are documented
in material compliance with all applicable federal and state Laws. _Schedule
2.14-e_ contains a true, correct and complete listing as of March 31, 2003,
which will be updated as of the latest month end prior to Closing, by account,
of: (i) all loans in excess of $100,000 of the Bank Subsidiary which have
been accelerated during the past twelve (12) months; (ii) all loan commitments
or lines of credit of Bank Subsidiary in excess of $100,000 which have been
terminated by Bank Subsidiary during the past twelve (12) months by reason of
Default or adverse developments in the condition of the borrower; (iii) all
loans, lines of credit and loan commitments in excess of $100,000 as to which
the Bank Subsidiary has given written notice of its intention to terminate in
the past twelve (12) months; (iv) all loans in excess of $100,000 (A) that are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (B) that are on non-accrual status, (C) that have been
classified "doubtful," "substandard," "loss," or the equivalent thereof by
Bank Subsidiary or a Regulatory Authority, (D) for which a reasonable doubt
exists, in the reasonable judgment of Bank Subsidiary as to the timely
future collectibility of principal and/or interest, whether or not interest
is still accruing or the loan is less than 90 days past due, (E) where the
interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been
extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance
with such initial terms or (F) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith (items (i)  (iv) above collectively referred to as
"Nonperforming Assets"); and (v) all loans or debts payable or owing to Bank
Subsidiary by any executive officer or director of TARGET or any Subsidiary or
any other Person deemed an "executive officer" or a "related interest" of any
of the foregoing, as such terms are defined in Regulation O of the Federal
Reserve Board. The aggregate amount of all Nonperforming Assets as listed on
Schedule 2.14-e at March 31, 2003, was $15,019,487 and at Closing there will
not be such a change in the Nonperforming Assets as to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect on Target.



(f) _ Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments._ _ Schedule 2.14-f_
lists all interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements and other
interest rate risk management arrangements to which TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or assets may be
bound. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements and other
interest rate risk management arrangements to which TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or assets may be
bound were entered into in the ordinary course of business and, to the
knowledge of TARGET, in accordance with prudent banking practice and
applicable rules, regulations and policies of Regulatory Authorities and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations and are in full force and effect. TARGET
and each of the Subsidiaries has duly performed in all material respects all
of its obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued, and to the knowledge of TARGET, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.



2.15 _Agreements in Force and Effect_. All material Contracts, licenses,
certificates, insurance policies, Permits, and franchise agreements of TARGET
relating to its business operations and finances are valid and in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, except to the extent in the
aggregate not material to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 2.15_ previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by
TARGET, neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has breached any provision
of, or is in Default in any material respect under the terms of, any such
Contract, license, certificate, insurance policy, Permit, or franchise
agreement, except in such respects as in the aggregate are not material to the
business, results of operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET
and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



 

A-12 2.16 _Litigation, Default_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.16_
 previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET, TARGET and the
Subsidiaries have complied with, and are not in default under, any Law
(including any reporting laws for cash transactions, suspicious activities,
etc.) or Order applicable to any of them, the failure to comply with which in
the aggregate might have a Material Adverse Effect on the business, results of
operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 2.16_ , neither TARGET
nor any Subsidiary is subject to any Order, having continuing effect, of any
court, arbitrator or other governmental agency or instrumentality. Except as
set forth in _Schedule 2.16_ , there is no Litigation or other proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of TARGET, threatened, which Litigation or other
proceeding might have a Material Adverse Effect on the business, results of
operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; and neither TARGET nor any Subsidiary has any Knowledge of
any reasonable basis for any such claim, action, suit, arbitration,
investigation, dispute or other proceeding.



2.17 _Consents Required_. The only Consents required by TARGET or any of
the Subsidiaries, in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, or to
avoid any acceleration of the maturity or performance under, or any Default
or breach of, or have a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET with respect to, any
material indebtedness, Contract, Right, franchise, Permit or other privilege
to which TARGET or any Subsidiary is a party, or by which any of their assets
are bound, are set forth on _Schedule 2.17_ previously delivered to AHI and
ACQUISITION by TARGET.



2.18 _Labor Matters_. There are no labor disputes between (i) TARGET or any
of the Subsidiaries; and (ii) any of their respective employees or
representatives of such employees which in the aggregate might have a Material
Adverse Effect on the business, results of operations, prospects or financial
condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither TARGET
nor any of the Subsidiaries is the subject of any pending organization effort
or representation election by or with respect to a labor union.



2.19 _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.19_
previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET:



(a) TARGET and the Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance with all
Environmental Laws, except for violations which would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on TARGET or the Subsidiaries.



(b) There is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of TARGET,
threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority or other forum
in which TARGET or any of Subsidiaries has been or, with respect to threatened
Litigation, may be named as a defendant (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to
the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material, whether or not
occurring at, on, under, adjacent to, or affecting (or potentially affecting)
a site owned, leased, or operated by TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries nor,
to the Knowledge of TARGET, is there any reasonable basis for any Litigation
of a type described in this sentence.



(c) During the period of TARGETs or any of the Subsidiaries ownership or
operation of any of their respective current properties, there have been no
storage or releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under, adjacent to, or
affecting (or potentially affecting) such properties. Prior to the period of
TARGETs or any of the Subsidiaries ownership or operation of any of their
respective current properties to the Knowledge of TARGET, there were no
storage or releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under, or affecting any such
property.



2.20 _Intellectual Property._



(a) _ Schedule 2.20-a_ previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by
TARGET to list all material Intellectual Property of TARGET and the
Subsidiaries. All of the Intellectual Property rights of TARGET and the
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and, if applicable,
constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the respective parties
thereto, and there have not been, and, there currently are not, any Defaults
thereunder by TARGET or a Subsidiary, except where failure to maintain such
rights or where  



 

A-13  such Default would not have a Material Adverse Effect. TARGET or a
Subsidiary owns or is the valid licensee of all such Intellectual Property
rights free and clear of all Liens or claims of infringement. Neither TARGET
nor any of the Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of TARGET, their respective
predecessors, has infringed the Intellectual Property rights of others and, to
the Knowledge of TARGET, none of the Intellectual Property rights as used in
the business conducted by TARGET or the Subsidiaries infringes upon or
otherwise violates the Rights of any Person, nor has any Person asserted a
claim of such infringement, except where such failure to maintain ownership
or a licensee or where such infringement would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on TARGET. To the knowledge of TARGET, neither TARGET nor the
Subsidiaries is obligated to pay any royalties to any Person with respect to
any such Intellectual Property.



(b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.20-b previously delivered to AHI and
ACQUISITION by TARGET or executed in contemplation of the Closing of this
transaction, no officer, director, or employee of TARGET or the Subsidiaries
is a party to any Contract which requires such officer, director, or employee
to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property or keep confidential any
trade secrets, proprietary data, customer information, or other
business information or which restricts or prohibits such officer, director,
or employee from engaging in activities competitive with any Person, including
TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries.



2.21 _Reports_. Since January 1, 1997, or the applicable date of
organization if later, TARGET and each Subsidiary has timely filed in all
material respects all reports and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with
Regulatory Authorities, except failures to file which would not impede AHIs
or ACQUISITIONs ability to carry on TARGETs business in all material
respects as presently conducted. As of its respective date (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing), each of such reports and documents, including the financial
statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects
with all applicable Laws. As of its respective date (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the
date of such filing), each TARGET or Subsidiary report did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



2.22 _No Action_. Neither TARGET nor any of the Subsidiaries has taken any
action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to TARGET
that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, from being consummated, or (ii) materially impede or
delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in
Sections 2.4 and 2.17 of this Agreement.



2.23  _SEC Filings._



(a) TARGET has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since the initial filing
date of the registration statement for TARGETs initial public offering. All
such required forms, reports and documents (including those that TARGET may
file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "TARGET SEC

regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such TARGET SEC Reports, and,
to the extent not included in the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
of the principal executive officers of TARGET and the principal financial
officer of TARGET (or each former principal executive officer of TARGET and
each former principal financial officer of TARGET, as applicable) has made
all certifications required by Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC

referred to as "Operating Subsidiary"), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank

securities laws.



(c) None of TARGETs other Subsidiaries is required to file any forms,
reports or other documents with the SEC or any state securities regulatory
authorities except for such filings which the failure to file is not
reasonably likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on TARGET or any Subsidiary.



(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.23_ , neither TARGET nor any of the
Subsidiaries is under any obligation, contingent or otherwise, which will
survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act of 1933.



2.24 _Insurance Filings_. (a) Superior Insurance Services, Inc., an
Arkansas corporation (herein referred to as "Insurance Agency Subsidiary"), a

agency licensed by the Arkansas Insurance Department to sell life, health,
property and casualty insurance and is in good standing with such Department.
Insurance Agency Subsidiary has filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be filed with applicable Regulatory Authorities in which filings

filed.

were filed.

may be paid off in full upon thirty (30) days notice without the payment of
any prepayment or other penalty/fees.

delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by TARGET, to TARGETs knowledge, Bank
Subsidiary currently has no customers predominately engaged in the business of

the officers and authorized representatives of AHI and ACQUISITION full and
unlimited access to its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, records
and employees including the list of TARGET shareholders, and those of the

be returned to TARGET and no non-public information shall be used for any
purpose and shall be held in strict confidence by AHI and ACQUISITION and

of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which

(ii) any event shall have occurred as a result of which, in the opinion of
counsel for TARGET or AHI and ACQUISITION, a resolicitation of proxies from
the shareholders of TARGET or the preparation of amended or supplemented proxy
solicitation materials is necessary or advisable, the parties shall promptly
prepare, in accordance with the procedures provided for above, and distribute
to the shareholders of TARGET an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
proxy solicitation materials previously distributed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the proxy statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or prior to responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, TARGET (i) shall provide AHI with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response, and (ii) shall include in such
document or response all comments.



In connection with the setting of any record date for any shareholders
meeting, TARGET shall give AHI and ACQUISITION notice of such record date
at least five (5) days prior to such record date. Unless TARGETs Board of
Directors has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in
compliance with Section 5.4(c), subject to all applicable federal securities

shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
pursuant to the Proxy Statement and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders as required by the
Delaware General Corporate Law or applicable NASDAQ National Market
requirements to obtain such approval. Unless TARGETs Board of Directors has
withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance
with Section 5.4(c), each of the Parties shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to promptly and expeditiously secure any
vote or consent of shareholders required by applicable Law and such
Partys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to effect the Merger.
TARGETs obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the TARGET
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.4(a) shall not be
limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to TARGET of any Acquisition Proposal or any
changes in the Board of Directors recommendation regarding the Merger.

recommend that TARGETs shareholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve

Directors of TARGET has recommended that TARGETs shareholders vote in favor
of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the TARGET

any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve
to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to AHI, the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of TARGET that TARGETs shareholders vote in favor of
and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger.



(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
TARGET from, prior to a favorable vote of the Shareholders, withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of
adopting and approving this Agreement and the Merger or from not including
its recommendation in favor of adopting and approving this Agreement and the
Merger in the Proxy Statement if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined  



 

A-20  below) is made to TARGET and not withdrawn, (ii) neither TARGET nor any of
its representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth
in Section 5.10 and TARGET is not then in breach of this Agreement, (iii) the
Board of Directors of TARGET concludes in good faith, after consultation with
and receiving advice from its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such
recommendation is necessary in order for the Board of Directors of TARGET to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to TARGETs shareholders under
applicable law; and (iv) TARGET complies with the requirements of Section
8.1(h); provided, however, that prior to any commencement thereof, TARGET
shall have given AHI at least forty-eight (48) hours notice thereof and the
opportunity to meet with TARGET and its counsel. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.4 shall limit TARGETs obligation to hold and convene the TARGET
Shareholders Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board
of Directors of TARGET shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona
fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, business

transaction involving TARGET pursuant to which those shareholders of TARGET
immediately preceding such transaction will hold less than 51% of the equity
interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii) a
sale or other disposition by TARGET of substantially all of its assets, or
(iii) the acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender
offer or an exchange offer or issuance by TARGET), directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
shares of capital stock of TARGET, in each case on terms that the Board of
Directors of TARGET determines, in its reasonable judgment to be more
favorable and provide higher value to TARGET shareholders (taking into account
all terms and conditions and the likelihood of consummation) than the terms of
the Merger (after receipt and consideration of written advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation); provided, however, that such
offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required
to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed and
is not likely in the judgment of TARGETs Board of Directors to be obtained by
such third party on a timely basis.



5.5 _Supplements to Information_. From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, TARGET will deliver to AHI and ACQUISITION, in writing, information
concerning events subsequent to the date hereof in order to keep the
information in the Schedules previously delivered timely, complete and
accurate.



5.6 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto agrees to execute and deliver
such instruments and take such other actions as the other parties may
reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Each
party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to perform and fulfill
all conditions and obligations on its part to be performed or fulfilled under
this Agreement and to effect the merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.



5.7 _Deposit of Funds with Registrar and Transfer Company_. On the Closing
Date, AHI and ACQUISITION shall cause to be deposited with Registrar and
Transfer Company as depository for the TARGET Common, an amount in immediately
available funds equal to $23.75 multiplied by the sum of the total number of
shares of TARGET Common issued and outstanding, as of the Closing Date which
are to be converted into the right to receive cash as determined pursuant to
Section 1.1(b).



5.8 _Adverse Changes in Condition_. Each Party agrees to give written
notice promptly to the other Party upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, or covenants contained herein, and to use its reasonable efforts
to prevent or promptly to remedy the same.



5.9  _Reports_. Each Party and its Subsidiaries shall file all reports
required to be filed by it with Regulatory Authorities between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time and, to the extent permitted by Law,
shall deliver to the other Party copies of all such reports promptly after
the same are filed.



 

A-21 5.10 _No Solicitation_. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII,
TARGET and the Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of
their respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by
any of them to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or
induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiring or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any contract relating to any
Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided, however, this Section
5.10(a) shall not prohibit TARGET or its Board of Directors from (A)
furnishing information regarding TARGET and the Subsidiaries to, entering into
a customary confidentiality agreement with or entering into discussions with,
any person or group in response to a Superior Offer submitted by such person
or group (and not withdrawn), (B) taking the actions described in Section
5.4(c) as permitted thereby, (C) recommending a Superior Offer to TARGETs
shareholders or (D) terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) in
order to immediately thereafter enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Offer, if in the case of either (A), (B), (C) or (D), (1)
neither TARGET nor any representative of TARGET and the Subsidiaries
shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.10,
(2) the Board of Directors of TARGET concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary in
order for the Board of Directors of TARGET to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to TARGETs shareholders under applicable law, (3)(x) at least two
(2) business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, TARGET
gives AHI written notice of the identity of such person or group and of
TARGETs intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group and (y)
TARGET receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
written and oral information furnished to such person or group by or on behalf
of TARGET, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to
such person or group, TARGET furnishes such information to AHI (to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished by TARGET to AHI). Nothing
in this Section 5.10(a) shall prevent TARGET or its Board of Directors from
complying with Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to which no violation of this
Section 5.10 shall have occurred. TARGET and the Subsidiaries will
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer or
director of TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of TARGET or any of the
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.10 by TARGET.



For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer
or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by AHI) relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from TARGET by any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
TARGET or any of its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of
TARGET or any of the Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving TARGET pursuant to which the
shareholders of TARGET immediately preceding such transaction hold less than
85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of the assets of
TARGET; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of TARGET.



 

A-22 (b) In addition to the obligations of TARGET set forth in paragraph (a) of
Section 5.10, TARGET as promptly as practicable shall advise AHI orally and in
writing of any request received by TARGET for information which TARGET
reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by TARGET with respect to, or
which TARGET reasonably believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. TARGET will keep AHI informed in all material
respects of the status and details (including material amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.



5.11  _REIT_. TARGET agrees to take such actions as AHI and ACQUISITION
may reasonably require in order to effect appropriate distributions and/or
liquidating distributions from Superior REIT, Inc., a Subsidiary ("REIT")
identified on Schedule 2.3 including the adoption of any appropriate plan of
liquidation, distribution and complete liquidation, or upstream merger of such
subsidiary, or similar action, all such action to be taken in connection with
Closing and effective immediately before the Closing and consummation of the
Merger, to the extent that state and federal tax treatment as a qualified real
estate investment trust as prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code for the
period ending immediately prior to Closing could be accommodated.



5.12 _Indemnification_. (a) For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Date, AHI shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless officers, directors and employees of TARGET (each being an
"Indemnified Party") against all liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions occurring upon or prior to the Effective Date (including without
limitation the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
extent authorized under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of TARGET
and Delaware law in effect on the date hereof.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
subsection (g), upon learning of any such liability or Litigation, shall
promptly notify AHI and the Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any
such Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Date) (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and, upon assumption
of such defense, Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified parties advises that there
are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifies Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel of the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this subsection to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and
(iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior consent; and provided further provided that
the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determinations hall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.



(c) For a period of three (3) years after the Effective Time, Surviving
Corporation shall, and AHI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain or cause Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect policies of
directors and officers liability insurance with coverage in amount and scope
at least as favorable in the aggregate as TARGETs existing policies with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the
Effective Time; provided however, that during such period, Surviving
Corporation shall in no event be required to expend pursuant to this Section
5.12(c) more than an amount per year equal to 150% of current premiums
paid by TARGET for such insurance, which current premium amount is set  



 

A-23  forth in Schedule 5.12(c) previously delivered to AHI and ACQUISITION by
TARGET; and provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance
exceed such maximum amount, Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.



(d) TARGET hereby represents and warrants to AHI that it has no Knowledge
of any claim, pending or threatened, or of any facts or circumstances that
could give rise to any obligation by AHI to provide the indemnification
required by this Section 5.12 other than as disclosed in this Agreement,
described in any schedule to this Agreement and claims arising from any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall survive the Effective Time
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Party may have by
contract or otherwise.



5.13 _Environmental Assessments_. AHI may have performed on its behalf and
its costs, such environmental assessments of all real property owned or
leased by TARGET or the Subsidiaries, as it deems desirable.



5.14 _Adequate Funding_. AHI and ACQUISITION will obtain sufficient liquid
funds to perform Surviving Corporations obligations to make the payments
required in Sections 1.1(b) and 1.3.



5.15 _Regulatory Approvals_. As soon as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, AHI and ACQUISITION shall prepare, with the assistance of
TARGET, all necessary filings with any Federal or State banking Regulatory
Authorities which may be necessary for approval to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to secure all such approvals as soon as practicable. Copies of all such
filings shall be furnished in advance to TARGET and its counsel except to the
extent that the Regulatory Authority maintains such filings as confidential.



5.16 _Resignations_. TARGET shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and tender resignations, or give such notice of such meetings as may
be necessary, and as requested by AHI, so that at Closing Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries may elect such officers and directors at
Closing as they deem desirable. __



5.17 _Assumption of Obligations Related to the Trust Preferred Securities_.
At or prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall take all steps and enter
into all documentation necessary or required for the Surviving Corporation
and/or such successor as contemplated by AHI to succeed and be substituted
for TARGET and assume its obligations under that certain Indenture, dated as
of March 26, 2003, by and between TARGET and U.S. Bank, National Association
("U.S. Bank"), and that certain Guarantee Agreement, dated as of March 26,
2003, by and between TARGET and U.S. Bank and that certain Indenture, dated as

satisfactory in form to U.S. Bank and State Street as trustees. In addition,
the Parties shall take all steps necessary or required to effectuate the
resignation or removal of the administrators under the Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trusts dated December 18, 2001 and March 26, 2003 copies of
which are set forth in _Schedule 2.3_.



ARTICLE VICONDITIONS TO TARGETS OBLIGATIONS



Each and every obligation of TARGET under this Agreement to be performed on or
before the Effective Time shall be subject to the satisfaction, on or before

Closing or the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

A-24 6.1 _Representations and Warranties True_. The representations and
warranties contained in Article III hereof shall be in all material respects
true and accurate as of the date when made and at and as of the Closing Date

shareholders of ACQUISITION, the granting of which is necessary for the

Each and every obligation of AHI and ACQUISITION under this Agreement to be
performed on or before the Effective Time shall be subject to the
satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of the following conditions:



7.1 _Representations and Warranties True_. The representations and
warranties contained in Article II hereof shall be in all material respects
true and accurate as of the date when made and at and as of the Closing Date

covenant and agreement required to be performed or complied with by it prior
to or on the Closing Date. TARGET shall have furnished AHI and ACQUISITION
with a certificate of TARGET signed by its Chief Executive Officer,
President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer to the
foregoing effect to the best of their Knowledge.

Authorities (without any requirement or condition of divestiture or
discontinuance of any asset or operation of TARGET or its Subsidiaries or AHI
and ACQUISITION, its subsidiaries and affiliates, or any other condition or
restriction any of which in the reasonable good faith judgment of the board of
directors of AHI would so materially adversely impact the economic benefits of
the transaction as contemplated by this Agreement so as to render
inadvisable the consummation of the Merger), federal, state, foreign or
local, and all approvals of shareholders of TARGET and any private Persons,
the granting of which is necessary for the consummation of the Merger, for
preventing the termination of any material right, privilege, license or
agreement of, or any material loss or disadvantage to, or the withholding of
which might have a Material Adverse Effect on the business, results of
operations, prospects or financial condition of TARGET and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, upon the consummation of the Merger, shall have been
obtained provided, that if the failure of any Regulatory Authority to issue a
required approval is based on AHIs or ACQUISITIONs capitalization
or capital structure which is unacceptable under applicable policies and
published guidelines of such Regulatory Authority, then such absence of
regulatory approval shall not be a condition to AHIs or ACQUISITIONs
obligations to close the transaction.



 

A-25 7.4 _Secretary s Certificate_. AHI and ACQUISITION shall have received
a certificate, dated the Closing Date, from the Secretary of TARGET which

commenced or threatened litigation, with respect to such settled litigation
and/or the subsequent judicial process and approvals, fairness hearings and
final approvals, or any other instances of litigation commenced or threatened
based on the same facts and activities upon which such settled litigation was
based or involved, which in the reasonable good faith judgment of the board
of directors of AHI would materially change the economic cost or risk to
TARGET as would be contemplated under the settlement agreements if finally
approved as written, or would materially adversely impact the economic
benefits of the transaction as contemplated by this agreement so as to render
inadvisable a consummation of the Merger.



7.7 _Environmental Assessment_. The Environmental Assessments described in
Section 5.13 shall not have revealed any condition which would constitute a

AHI and TARGET;



(b) by either TARGET or AHI if the Merger shall not have been consummated
(i) within nine (9) months after the date of this Agreement, or (ii) in the
event the delay is solely the result of the failure to obtain approval of
Regulatory Authorities, within one (1) year after the date of this Agreement,
unless extended by the Boards of Directors of TARGET and AHI for any reason;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to
act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to
occur on or before such date if such action or failure to act constitutes a
breach of this Agreement;



(c) by either TARGET or AHI if a Regulatory Authority shall have issued an
Order, or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which Order shall
have become final and nonappealable;

TARGET contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

this Agreement; 



 

A-26 (e) by TARGET, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of
AHI or ACQUISITION set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of AHI or ACQUISITION shall have been untrue when made or shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.1 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, if such breach would
prevent AHI or ACQUISITION from consummating the Closing or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, that if such inaccuracy in AHI or
ACQUISITIONs representations and warranties or breach by AHI or ACQUISITION
is curable by AHI or ACQUISITION through exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts, then TARGET may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) for thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from
TARGET to AHI and ACQUISITION of such breach, provided, that AHI and/or
ACQUISITION continue to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach (it being understood that TARGET may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if such breach by AHI or ACQUISITION is cured
during such thirty-day period);

warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such inaccuracy in
TARGETs representations and warranties or breach by TARGET is curable
by TARGET through exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then AHI

the Merger; (ii) TARGET shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of TARGET in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger; (iii) the Board of

have recommended to the shareholders of TARGET or approved any Acquisition
Proposal; (v) TARGET shall have entered into any agreement or contract

(h) by TARGET prior to the vote of the shareholders of TARGET on the
Agreement, if, after receiving a Superior Offer and in the absence of any
prior breach of the provisions of Section 5.11 of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of TARGET determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of TARGET under applicable law; provided,
however, that TARGET may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this subsection (h) until two (2) days have elapsed following delivery to AHI
of written notice of such determination of TARGET (which written notice will
inform AHI of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer);
provided, further, that such determination and the right to terminate under
this  



 

A-27  Section 8.1(h) shall not be effective until TARGET has made payment to AHI
of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i) and TARGET

(i) if any of the conditions to the obligations of AHI set forth in Article
VII have not been satisfied or waived by AHI at closing or AHI reasonably
determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article
VII has become impossible (other than as a result of any failure on the part
of AHI or Acquisition to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of
AHI or Acquisition set forth in this Agreement); 



(ii) in the event of a discovery by AHI of unknown or undisclosed
liabilities which AHI in its sole, but reasonable, discretion deems
significant and could be likely to cause a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET;



(iii) in the event there has been a Material Adverse Effect on TARGET or
AHI.



(j) By TARGET if any of the conditions to the obligations of TARGET set
forth in Article VI have not been satisfied or waived by TARGET at closing or
TARGET reasonably determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Article VI has become impossible (other than as a result of any
failure on the part of TARGET to comply with or perform any covenant or
obligation of TARGET set forth in this Agreement) but only if the failure to
satisfy the condition would prevent AHI or ACQUISITION from consummating the
Closing or the transactions contemplated hereby;



8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon (or if
termination is pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or 8.1(f) and the proviso therein is
applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written notice thereof by
the terminating party to the other Parties. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, with no liability of Party to the other Parties,
except (i) the provisions set forth in this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and

Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for
any intentional or willful breach of this Agreement.

(b)(i) TARGET shall pay to AHI in immediately available funds, within one
(1) business day after demand by AHI an amount equal to $6,345,000.00 (the

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by AHI or TARGET, as applicable,
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) or (d)(i), (B) prior to such termination a third
party shall have announced an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within twelve (12)
months following the termination of this Agreement a TARGET Acquisition is
consummated or TARGET enters into an agreement or binding letter of intent
providing for a TARGET Acquisition, then TARGET shall pay AHI in immediately
available funds at or prior to consummating such TARGET Acquisition an amount
equal to the Termination Fee.



(iii) Each of TARGET, AHI and ACQUISITION acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, AHI would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if TARGET fails to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, AHI makes a claim that results in a judgment against
