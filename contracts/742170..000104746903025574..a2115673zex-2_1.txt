MERGER (the "AGREEMENT"), dated as of July 30, 2003, by and among, CITIZENS
BANK OF MASSACHUSETTS, a Massachusetts trust company (the "BUYER"), COMMUNITY
BANCORP, INC., a Massachusetts corporation (the "SELLER"), and for the
purpose of Article III and Section 6.15, CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., a
Delaware corporation and the parent company of the Buyer (the "PARENT"). The
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 9.14
hereof.   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Seller
have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
stockholders and other constituencies, as well as the communities they serve,
to consummate, and have approved, the business combination transactions
provided for herein, in which the Buyer will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, acquire the Seller;   WHEREAS, following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Buyer shall take such action as
is appropriate to form a subsidiary to be organized as a corporation (the
"MERGER SUB") under the MBCL, and to cause the Merger Sub to become a party
to this Agreement, pursuant to which the Merger Sub shall merge (the
"MERGER") with and into the Seller, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein (the Seller and the Merger Sub being the
constituent corporations of the Merger);   WHEREAS, following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer (sometimes referred to herein as the
"SURVIVING BANK"), shall enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"BANK MERGER AGREEMENT") with COMMUNITY NATIONAL BANK, a national bank and
subsidiary of the Seller (the "SELLER BANK"), in a form mutually agreed upon
by the parties hereto, providing for the merger of the Seller Bank with and
into the Buyer (the "BANK MERGER") under the MGL, promptly following the
consummation of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I - THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the
MBCL, at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Seller. The Seller shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
called the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws      of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as a subsidiary of the Buyer. The name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC." and the purpose of the
Surviving Corporation shall be solely to engage in bank
permissible activities under applicable provisions of MGL and relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.   1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall
become effective when Articles of Merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER"), executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCL, are filed with the
Massachusetts Secretary; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that upon the mutual written
consent of each of the Buyer and the Seller, the Articles of Merger may
provide for a later time or date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than
thirty (30) days after the date the Articles of Merger are filed with the
Massachusetts Secretary. When used in this Agreement, the term "EFFECTIVE
TIME" shall mean the date and time at which the Articles of Merger are filed
with the Massachusetts Secretary or such later date and time established in
the Articles of Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Massachusetts Secretary shall be
made on the Closing Date.   1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in Section 80 of the MBCL.   1.4 CONVERSION OF SELLER COMMON STOCK. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Merger Sub, the Seller, or the holder of any of the shares of the
Seller Common Stock:   (a) Each share of the common stock, par value $2.50
per share, of the Seller ("SELLER COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "SHARES") (other than
Shares held (i) in the Seller\'s treasury or (ii) directly or indirectly by
the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries (except for
Trust Account Shares, DPC Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall become and be
converted automatically into the right to receive in cash from the Buyer an
amount equal to $19.75 (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (b) All of the
Shares converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a
"CERTIFICATE") previously representing any such Shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Certificates previously representing Shares shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon.   (c) At the Effective
Time, all Shares that are owned by the Seller as treasury stock and all
Shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the Buyer or the Seller or
any of their respective subsidiaries (other than Shares held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties,
including Shares held in the Seller 401(k) Savings Plan (including
the Employee Profit Sharing Component) (any such Shares, whether held
directly or indirectly by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, being
referred to herein as "TRUST ACCOUNT SHARES") and other than any Shares held
by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries   
2      in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such Shares which
are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by the Buyer or the
Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries, being referred to herein as
"DPC SHARES")) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares, the
holders of which shall have delivered to the Seller a written demand for
the appraisal of such Shares in the manner provided in the applicable
provisions of the MBCL ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into the
right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable in exchange for such Shares pursuant to this Section 1.4 but,
instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of the
MBCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any holder of Dissenting Shares (i) shall
subsequently deliver a written withdrawal of his demand for appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares or (ii) fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal
rights as provided in Sections 86 through 98, inclusive, of the MBCL, such
holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal
of such Dissenting Shares and each of such shares shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into the right to receive, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable in exchange for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to this
Section 1.4, without any interest thereon.   (e) The Seller shall give the
Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands filed pursuant to Sections 86 through
98, inclusive, of the MBCL received by the Seller, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served in connection with such demands
pursuant to the MBCL and received by the Seller, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under
the MBCL consistent with the obligations of the Seller thereunder. The Seller
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, (x) make any
payment with respect to, or to any person making, any such demand, (y) offer
to settle or settle any such demand or (z) waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand in accordance with the MBCL.   1.5 MERGER SUB
COMMON STOCK. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become and be converted
automatically into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.6 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Seller shall take all such action as is necessary to terminate all
outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Seller Common Stock (each a
"STOCK OPTION") including, without limitation, Stock Options issued pursuant
to the 2001 Directors\' Plan dated February 22, 2001 and the 2001 Incentive
Stock Option Plan for Key Employees dated April 10, 2001 (collectively, the
"SELLER STOCK OPTION PLANS"), as of the Effective Time. In connection
therewith, Seller shall provide written notice to each holder of a then
outstanding Stock Option (whether or not such Stock Option is then vested or
exercisable), (i) that such Stock Option shall be, as at the date of such
notice, exercisable in full; (ii) that such Stock Option shall terminate at
the Effective Time; and (iii) that, if such Stock Option is not exercised or
otherwise terminated on or before the fifth (5th) day prior to the Effective
Time, such holder shall be entitled to receive in cancellation of such Stock
Option a cash payment from the Seller at the Closing in an amount equal to
the excess of the Merger    3      Consideration over the per share
exercise price of such Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of
Seller Common Stock covered by such Stock Option, subject to any required
withholding of taxes (such payment, the "STOCK OPTION CASH SETTLEMENT")

optionholders executing an acknowledgement that the Stock Option Cash
Settlement represents the full amount due for all Stock Options held by
Seller. The Seller Stock Option Plans and all Stock Options shall
terminate at the Effective Time. The Seller hereby represents and warrants to
the Buyer that the maximum number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to
issuance pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options is not and shall not be at

soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later than
three (3) business days thereafter, the Buyer shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which

the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
Buyer) and other appropriate materials required to complete the exchange of
the Certificates for the Merger Consideration into which each Share

surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.  
(b) At any time following the expiration of the sixth (6th) month after the
Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to any funds which have not been disbursed to holders of Shares (including,
without limitation, all interest and other income in respect of the

to the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates held by them.   (c) After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Seller of the Shares which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
Shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.   (d) Neither the Buyer nor the Seller nor any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any shares or any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any Merger Consideration

official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   (e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft
or destruction and to the ownership of such Certificate by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the receipt by
the Buyer of appropriate and customary indemnification, the Buyer will issue
in exchange for each Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, as determined in accordance with this
Article II.    5       ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

each other concerning the matters set forth in Section 5.5 of the Seller

to take such actions as are necessary to dissolve Benefits Consulting and
terminate all of the agreements of Benefits Consulting. No action taken by
the Seller or the Seller Bank pursuant to this Section 5.5 or the
consequences resulting there from shall be deemed to be a breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant herein or constitute a
Material Adverse Effect. In the event that the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries takes, at the request of the Buyer, any action pursuant to this
Section 5.5, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and its subsidiaries for
any out-    32      of-pocket fees, expenses and charges, and the
costs of reversing the action taken, if for any reason the Merger is not

branches concurrently with or after the Merger; it being understood that any
such application or notice may be filed at any time before the Effective Time
as determined by the Buyer in its sole discretion. If for any reason the

expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of such
applications at the request of the Buyer.   5.7 PURCHASER PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller

offer any such products or services prior to the Effective Time.   5.8 ALCO
MANAGEMENT. The Seller and the Seller Bank agree to manage their assets and
liabilities in accordance with Seller\'s asset and liability management
policy as in effect on the date hereof, unless otherwise agreed by the

the Buyer agree to consult on investment programs to be administered by the
Seller Bank.   5.9 DEPOSIT INCENTIVE PLAN. The Seller agrees that it will

reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and its counsel. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the
other party hereto, to cause the Seller Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Seller
Common Stock entitled to vote at the Seller Stockholders Meeting referred to
in Section 6.1(a) hereof at the earliest practicable time.   
34       (d) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger and
the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Authorities. The Buyer and the Seller shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be,
and any of their respective subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they

promptly advise each other upon receiving (and the Buyer shall so advise with
respect to communications received by any Affiliate of the Buyer) any
communication from any Governmental Authority or third party whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by

likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval or third party consent will

term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any
of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries\' directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives (collectively, its "AGENTS") to,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, take any
action to facilitate, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information in
furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal
regarding any Acquisition Transaction, or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than the
Buyer and its Affiliates or representatives) concerning any Acquisition
Transaction or enter into any definitive agreement,   
35      arrangement or understanding for any Acquisition Transaction or
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, THAT the Seller
or its Agents may furnish or cause to be furnished information to, and
negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any individual or entity
that delivers a bona fide written proposal for an Acquisition Transaction
that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Seller or any of its
Agents after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Seller Stockholders
Meeting if and so long as (a) the Board of Directors of the Seller determines
(i) in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failing to take such action would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable laws and (ii) that such a proposal is or
would be reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (b) prior to
furnishing any information to such individual or entity, Seller shall enter
into a confidentiality agreement with such individual or entity that is no
less restrictive, in any material respect, than the Confidentiality Agreement
dated as of June 20, 2003 by and between Parent and Seller ("CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"), and Seller shall enforce, and shall not waive any of the
provisions of any such confidentiality agreement. The Board of Directors of
the Seller shall be permitted to withdraw, modify or change in a manner
adverse to the Buyer its recommendation to the Seller\'s stockholders
required under Section 6.1(b) hereof with respect to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (aa) after consultation with
the Seller\'s outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors of the
Seller determines in good faith by a majority vote that failing to take such
action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; (bb)
the Board of Directors of the Seller has determined in good faith by a
majority vote that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (cc) the
Board of Directors of the Seller has given the Buyer five (5) business days\'
prior written notice of its intention to withdraw, modify or change in a
manner adverse to the Buyer its recommendation to the Seller\'s stockholders
required under Section 6.1(b) hereof; (dd) the Seller\'s Board of Directors
has considered any changes to the Merger Consideration and to this Agreement
(if any) proposed by the Buyer; (ee) the Seller\'s Board of Directors has
determined in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with the
Seller\'s outside legal counsel and after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such unsolicited proposal
remains a Superior Proposal even after the changes proposed by Buyer; and
(ff) the Seller has complied in all material respects with this Section 6.2
(PROVIDED, THAT the foregoing shall in no way limit or otherwise affect
Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
hereof). Any such withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the Seller shall not change the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Seller for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Seller immediately will
cease, and shall cause its Agents and subsidiaries and its subsidiaries\'
Agents to cease, all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with
any individual or entity conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal
for an Acquisition Transaction and request the return or destruction of all
confidential information regarding Seller or its subsidiaries provided to any
such individual or entity prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of any confidentiality agreements and the Seller shall enforce, and
shall not waive, any of the provisions of any such
confidentiality agreement.    36      From and after the execution
of this Agreement, Seller shall advise Buyer within the Notice Period of the
receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations,
or proposals relating to an Acquisition Transaction (including a summary of
material and significant terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
other individual or entity or individuals or entities involved), or its
receipt of any request for information from the Federal Reserve Board, the
DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction, and promptly furnish to Buyer a copy of any such request for
information or written proposal in addition to a copy of any information
provided to or by any third party relating thereto. In addition, Seller shall
immediately advise Buyer, in writing, if the Board of Directors of the Seller
shall make any determination as to any Acquisition Transaction
as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 6.2. For
the purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" shall mean any bona
fide Acquisition Transaction on terms the Board of Directors of the Seller
determines in its good faith judgment taking into account the factors listed
in Article 6, paragraph 6 of Seller\'s Articles of Organization and taking
into account the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation (taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Transaction, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation (including, without limitation, any
financing conditions), the likelihood and anticipated timing of consummation
and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the individual or entity making the proposal) are in the aggregate more
favorable from a financial point of view and provide greater value to all the
Seller\'s stockholders than the Merger Consideration, this Agreement and the
Merger taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION
TRANSACTION" means any offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest
in (a) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, or consolidation, or any
similar transaction, involving the Seller or any of its subsidiaries, (b) a
purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial
portion of the assets or deposits of the Seller or all or substantially all
of the assets or deposits of any of its subsidiaries, (c) a purchase or other
acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for

Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder)
of securities representing ten percent (10%) or more of the voting power of
the Seller or any of its subsidiaries, or (d) any substantially similar
transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "NOTICE PERIOD" shall
mean (i) with respect to written inquiries or proposals or other written
materials, written notice as promptly as practicable and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof and (ii) with respect to
oral inquires, discussions, negotiations, or proposals, oral notice as

information, each of the Buyer and the Seller, for the purposes of verifying
the representations and warranties of the other and relating to the Merger
and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause
each of their respective subsidiaries to,    37      afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to

and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other

laws (other than reports or documents which the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
party may reasonably request. The Seller also shall provide the Buyer with
reasonable access to the Seller\'s officers, employees and agents and with
copies of all periodic reports to the Seller\'s senior management. Neither
the Buyer nor the Seller nor any of their respective subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the Buyer\'s customers or
the Seller\'s customers, as the case may be, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, as
permitted under applicable law, under circumstances in which the restrictions
of the preceding sentence apply.   (b) All information furnished by any
party hereto to the other or its representatives pursuant hereto shall be
treated as the sole property of the party providing the information and, if
the Merger shall not occur, the party being furnished such information shall
not use any such information and shall return to the other party all of such
written information and all documents, notes, summaries or other materials
containing, reflecting or referring to, or derived from, such information.
The parties hereto shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their representatives to, keep confidential all such information, and
shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or
other commercial purpose. The obligation to keep such information
confidential and not use any such information shall continue for five years
from the date the proposed Merger is abandoned and shall not apply to (i) any
information which (x) was already in the possession of the party
being furnished such information prior to the disclosure thereof by the other
party, (y) was then generally known to the public, or (z) was disclosed to
the party being furnished such information by a third party not bound by an
obligation of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures made as required by
law.   (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of
the other set forth herein.   6.4 LEGAL CONDITIONS TO MERGER. Each of the
Buyer and its Affiliates, and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause
its subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly
with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Buyer or    38      the Seller or any
of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5
EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFIT MATTERS.   (a) PROVISION OF BENEFITS. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer agrees to provide the
employees of the Seller and its subsidiaries who remain employed after the
Effective Time (the "SELLER EMPLOYEES") with at least the types and levels of
employee benefits (including employee contribution levels) maintained from
time to time by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for similarly-
situated employees of the Buyer. The Buyer will treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of Seller Employees with
Seller or any subsidiary of Seller attributable to any period before the
Effective Time as service rendered to the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate
benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual (including minimum
pension amount), eligibility for early retirement and eligibility for retiree
welfare benefit plans, attributable to any period before the Effective Time.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall not treat any Seller Employee
as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health or
similar plan of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for a pre-existing
medical condition, and any deductibles paid under any of Seller\'s or its
subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles under
the health plans of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer upon delivery to
the Buyer of appropriate documentation. The Buyer will make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result.   (b)
CONTINUATION OF PLANS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, and except as set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the Buyer shall have sole discretion with respect to
the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any
employee benefit plans and programs of the Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Buyer shall continue to maintain the Seller plans (other than stock-based
or incentive plans or stock funds in retirement plans) until the Seller
Employees are permitted to participate in the plans of the Buyer or any
Affiliate of the Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement shall alter or limit the
Buyer\'s obligations, if any, under ERISA, as amended by the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and/or the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to the rights of
Seller Employees and their qualified beneficiaries in connection with the
group health plan maintained by the Seller as of the Effective Time.   (c)
SEVERANCE PAY PLAN. The Buyer shall provide the severance benefits set forth
in Section 6.5(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to any Seller Employee
who is not otherwise covered by a specific termination, severance or change
in control agreement and who is terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliates for
reasons other than cause (which shall mean gross negligence or dereliction in
the performance of such employee\'s duties, dishonesty or commission of
a crime) in the six (6) month period immediately following the Closing
Date. Payment of severance pay is conditioned on the execution by Seller
Employee of a release in a form satisfactory to the Buyer and the expiration
of any statutory expiration period.    39       (d) COMPENSATION
AGREEMENTS. As soon as practicable, following the Effective Time, subject to
the provisions of Section 6.5(e) hereof, the Buyer shall pay to each of the
individuals listed in Section 6.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the
amounts such individuals are entitled to receive in connection with the
Merger. Section 6.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists such
individuals, the amounts such individuals are entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger, and the agreements, plans and arrangements giving rise to such
payments. In exchange for the payments due the individuals, each individual
shall deliver to the Buyer a Settlement Agreement ("SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT")
and a Release of Claims ("RELEASE AGREEMENT") in the forms attached to
Section 6.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. As to, and only as to,
each individual who enters into a Settlement Agreement, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that (i) the Merger constitutes a "Change of Control" or "Change
in Control" for all purposes pursuant to such agreements, plans and
arrangements and (ii) in light of Buyer\'s plans relating to management
assignments and responsibilities with respect to the business of Buyer from
and after the Effective Time, each director and officer or employee which is
a party to, or is otherwise subject to, any such agreement will, upon
consummation of the Merger, be considered to have terminated employment
thereunder and receive the severance and other similar benefits as if there
were a termination of employment for "Good Reason," involuntary termination,"
constructive discharge, (including, but not limited to, demotion or reduction
in compensation) or other similar events, regardless of whether such
termination of employment has occurred or subsequently occurs. No payments
under this Section 6.5(d) shall be made to any individual unless such
individual has executed and delivered to the Buyer the Settlement
Agreement and Release Agreement.   (e) PARACHUTE PAYOUTS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the
Seller, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank, or any of
their respective subsidiaries, take any action or make any payments that
would result, either individually or in the aggregate, in the payment of a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G or that would
result, either individually or in the aggregate, in payments that would be
nondeductible pursuant to Code Section 162(m). The Seller and the Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve matters relating to any of the
foregoing.   (f) CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYMENT. No provision of this Section
6.5 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates and no provision of this Section 6.5 shall create such
rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any employee program or any plan or arrangement
which may be established by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No provision
of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend,
modify or terminate after the Effective Time any such plans or arrangements
of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.   6.6 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\'
INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.   (a) In the event of any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or
has been at    40      any time prior to the date of this Agreement,
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee
of Seller or any of its subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Seller, any of the Seller\'s
subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted
or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.
It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether asserted of arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with the Buyer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (w) the Buyer
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption
the Buyer or the Surviving Bank shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Buyer elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties and reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Buyer and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with the Buyer, and the Buyer shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (x) the Buyer shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, unless the proposed
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest among such
parties, in which case the Buyer shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of one additional counsel to the extent necessary to avoid such conflict, (y)
the Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (z)
the Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under
this Section 6.6, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall notify the Buyer thereof, PROVIDED, THAT the failure
to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Buyer under this Section
6.6 except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the
Buyer. The Buyer\'s obligations under this Section 6.6 shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim.   (b) The Buyer shall maintain the Seller\'s
(including its subsidiaries\') existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance (the "DandO; INSURANCE") covering persons who are   
41      currently covered by the Seller\'s DandO; Insurance for a period
of six (6) years after the Effective Time on terms no less favorable than
those in effect on the date hereof and shall at the Effective Time provide
evidence of such extension of coverage to the Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Buyer may substitute therefor policies providing substantially comparable
coverage and containing terms and conditions no less favorable than those in
effect on the date hereof. In connection with the foregoing, the Seller
agrees to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such
representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of
any prior claims.   (c) In the event the Buyer or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer assume the obligations set forth in this section.  
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification
rights that any Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives
may have under the Articles of Organization or By-Laws of the Seller or the
equivalent documents of any of the Seller\'s subsidiaries, any contract or
applicable law.   6.7 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Bank with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or the Bank
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, the Buyer.   6.8
ADVICE OF CHANGES. The Buyer and the Seller shall each promptly notify the
other party of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it
or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   6.9
UPDATE OF DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, the Seller will promptly supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure
Schedule in writing to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth

correct any information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule which has
been rendered inaccurate thereby. In addition, at or prior to the Effective
Time, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with a written copy of the complete
Seller Disclosure Schedule, marked to show any and all such supplements and

particular Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Seller shall
provide the Buyer with a certificate signed on behalf of the Seller by a duly
authorized officer of the Seller to such effect.    42      No
supplement or amendment to the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall have
any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set

set forth in Article V hereof.   6.10 CURRENT INFORMATION.   (a) As soon
as practicable, the Seller will furnish to the Buyer copies of all such

to the Buyer such additional financial data as the Buyer may reasonably
request.   (b) Promptly upon receipt thereof, the Seller will furnish to the
