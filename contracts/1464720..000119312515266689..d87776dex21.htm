delay or prevent the completion of the Merger, (ii) the Requested

neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any
action in contravention of any Laws or any Organizational Documents or any
other contract or agreement to which the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or

imposed on, or any adverse Tax consequences to, any shareholder or other
equity interest holder of Company, or other adverse consequences to the
shareholders or equity holders of Company as a whole, incrementally greater
than the Taxes or other adverse consequences to such Person in connection
with the consummation of this Agreement in the absence of such action taken
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, unless such holders are indemnified by Parent
for such incremental Taxes. Parent shall upon request by Company advance to
Company or Company LP all reasonable out-of-pocket costs to be incurred by
Company or the applicable Company Subsidiaries or, promptly upon request by
Company or Company LP, reimburse Company or Company LP for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Company or Company LP in connection with any

harmless Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a result of taking such
actions. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed
to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the Requested
Transactions.

income tax purposes the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by Company
of all of Companys assets to Merger Sub in exchange for the Merger

and shall be paid to the Surviving Entity as the Surviving Entity directs. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this _Article 3_ , and

(f) None of Parent, Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to
any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration if the Exchange Fund has

applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear
of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

forfeiture restrictions (whether or not then vested or subject to
any performance condition that has not been satisfied). At the Merger
Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be considered (to
the extent that such share of Company Restricted Stock is not otherwise
considered to be outstanding) an outstanding share of Company Common Stock

Share Merger Consideration. As of the Merger Effective Time, each holder of
shares of Company Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Restricted Stock. The portion of the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Restricted Stock
with respect thereto shall be reduced by any amount required to be withheld
under applicable Tax Law in connection with the vesting of such Company
Restricted Stock and such withheld amount shall be treated as having been paid
to such holders in respect of whom such withholding was made.

or other rights under the Company DRIP enable the holder of such rights to
acquire any interest in the Company or the Surviving Entity as a result of
such purchase or the exercise of such rights at or after such date; _provided_
, _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall be entitled
to issue shares of the Company Common Stock under the Company DRIP in respect
of cash dividends paid by the Company with respect to the second quarter of

that any such rights shall be available.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheets
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract

venture or limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for United States federal

income tax purposes or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code.

under the Exchange Act, using the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission, Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and nonfinancial) required to be
disclosed by Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the

periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that all such information
is accumulated and communicated to Companys management as appropriate to

report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its

would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Companys ability to record,

valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). No event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantor under such Guarantee.

of this Agreement, other than the Transition Services Agreement, Purchase
Agreement and all documents and transactions contemplated thereby, none of
Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates has entered into

acknowledge and agree shall (x) be held solely for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock and Company Restricted Stock, (y) be distributed at or
prior to Closing such that the Surviving Entity shall have no right or
interest in such proceeds, and (z) be treated as a distribution of such
consideration to the

the Merger on or before the Outside Date,

 

(B) neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall take any action in
connection with the Excluded Property Transactions in contravention of any

be expected to result in any adverse Tax consequences to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, incrementally greater than the Tax consequences to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the consummation of this
Agreement and the absence of such action taken pursuant to this Section
6.1(d), including but not limited to causing any Tax liability associated with
entering into a "prohibited transaction" (but expressly excluding any
Transfer Taxes in connection with the transfer of any Excluded Company
Property to the Liquidating Entity or any Transferee or subsidiary thereof or
the distribution of interests in the Liquidating Entity to holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Restricted Stock to the extent Company or any
Company

 



63  Subsidiary could have any Liability in connection therewith, which Transfer
Taxes shall otherwise be indemnifiable or reimbursable pursuant to the other
provisions of this Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.1(f)).

In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any amount described in

expended by Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing
shall (X) be held solely for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Restricted Stock, (Y) either (i) be distributed to the

amounts to the holders of the equity interests in Company in liquidation of
Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code in furtherance of
the "plan of liquidation" of Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with

Subsidiary, the Advisor or their Affiliates shall engage in any marketing or
other sales activity with respect to the Excluded Company Properties,

other service providers (other than the external advisor to the Liquidating
Entity), or the entering into letters of intent, term sheets or other sales

properties (other than any unsolicited offers that may lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, which shall be governed by the provisions of Section

Property Transaction for its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



64 (e) The Parties agree that (i) to the extent that an Excluded Company Property
and a Company Property are contiguous, they will reasonably cooperate in good
faith to cause the appropriate Persons to enter into such reciprocal and other
easements, declarations or other agreements, as are reasonably necessary to
provide access or other necessary or desirable property rights that such
Company Property or Excluded Company Property require for their intended use
and purpose or are otherwise reasonably necessary in connection with the
development of any Excluded Company Property, and (ii) Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary shall assign any contract and discharge and

Property.

 

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall transfer the Company Subsidiaries
that own the Excluded Company Properties to one or more entities (each, a "

liquidating entity the interests in which will be distributed (the " _Excluded
Property Distribution_ ") to the holders of the Company Common Stock and
Company Restricted Stock (together with the Transferees, the " _Liquidating
Entity_ ") immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. Prior to the
Excluded Property Distribution, the Liquidating Entity shall have reimbursed
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any Liquidation Expenses not yet
netted from any distribution or otherwise reimbursed and shall have agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries (other than

take any such action.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this

the SEC, the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable. Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to
Company and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by
Company in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement. Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it
and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and
advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
received from the SEC and shall consult with Parent prior to responding to any
such comments or requests. Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Company shall
cooperate and provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and shall include in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by Company or Parent which, in the reasonable
judgment of Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, any of the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto, and Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to stockholders of Company. Nothing in this _Section 7.1(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 7.1(a)_. For purposes
of _Section 4.14_,  _Section 5.5_ and this _Section 7.1_, any information

concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been
provided by Parent.

 



66 (c) Whether or not Company has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company

Company Stockholder Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting.
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Company

made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 7.3_.
Company shall keep Parent reasonably apprised as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by Company with respect to the Company Stockholder
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_,
if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Company shall have the right to, and at the request of
Parent shall, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Stockholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the times
reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the

one hundred twenty (120) days following the record date established in
accordance with this  _Section 7.1(c)_.

_Section 7.2_ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon
advice of counsel (including all restrictions set forth in the Access
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof), Company shall, and
shall cause each of Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, contracts, personnel and records (including access to the Company
Properties for the purposes the Phase II investigations for which Parent has
a reasonable basis to request Phase II investigations and subject to the prior
written consent of Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, _provided_ , _however_ , that all such investigations conducted by
or at the direction of Parent shall be reasonable in scope, _provided_
_further_ , that all such Phase II investigations shall be subject to the
requirements and obligations on Parent and its Affiliates set forth in the
Access Agreement (including Section 2 thereof)) and, during such period,
Company shall, and shall

 



67  cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other
information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No representation or warranty as
to the accuracy of information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ is
made and Parent may not rely on the accuracy of such information except to the
extent expressly set forth in the representations and warranties included in
_Article 4_ , and no investigation under this _Section 7.2(a)_ or otherwise
shall affect any of the representations and warranties of Company contained in
this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall not be required by
this _Section 7.2(a)_ to provide Parent or its Representatives with access to
or to disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (if Company has used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission or consent of such third
party to such disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
applicable to Company or any of their Representatives, or (C) that is subject
to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or
would cause a risk of loss of privilege to Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
any disruption to the businesses of Company and the Company Subsidiaries that
may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior
to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its respective
Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with
parties with which Company or any Company Subsidiary has a business
relationship (including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of Company
and the Company Subsidiaries or this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Company
( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict Parent and its Representatives and
Affiliates from contacting such parties in pursuing the business of Parent
operating in the ordinary course).

(b) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the provision of the
Confidentiality Agreement providing that it will terminate upon the execution
and delivery of this Agreement.

_Section 7.3_ _No Solicitation; Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.3(b)_, _Section 7.3(d)_ or
_Section 7.3(f)_, during the Interim Period, Company shall not, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize any
Representatives of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to (and shall
instruct such Representative of Company or any of the Company 

 



68  Subsidiaries not to), (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the
announcement, making or completion of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate or engage in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person other than Parent or its Representatives any non-public information or
data with respect to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve,
recommend, publicly declare advisable or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, share exchange agreement, consolidation agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
in each case related to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring or having the effect of
requiring Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or
fail to consummate the Merger (each, a " _Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or (iv) agree to or propose publicly to do any of the
foregoing. Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and
shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Representatives of Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing negotiations and
other activities with any Person and its Representatives (other than Parent or
any of its Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (including by terminating access to any data room
maintained in connection therewith), (B) instruct and cause any Person and its
Representatives (other than Parent or any of its Representatives) who have
been furnished confidential information regarding Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a
Company Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all information,
documents, and materials relating to the Company Acquisition Proposal or to
Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by
Company or any of the Representatives of Company to such Person or
its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person (to the extent provided for in such confidentiality
agreement), and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of any standstill agreement (including any standstill
provisions contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party ( _provided_ that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is understood
and agreed that Company by execution of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
waived immediately prior to the date of this Agreement any provision in any
such agreement that prohibits the counterparty thereto from confidentially
requesting Company or such Company Subsidiary to amend or waive the standstill
provision in such agreement ( _i.e._ , a "dont ask, dont waive" provision)
to the extent necessary (and only to such extent) to enable such counterparty
to convey confidentially a Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board),
unless, solely with respect to clause (C), the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that such action would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable law.

 



69 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 7.3(a)_ to the contrary,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) Company receives a written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (B) such Company Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a violation
of _Section 7.3(a)_, and (C) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to,
a Company Superior Proposal, then, subject to its giving Parent at least 24
hours prior written notice (which notice shall identify the third party making
such Company Acquisition Proposal and contain a copy thereof, including any
related debt and equity financing commitments), Company may (and may authorize
the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x) furnish
non-public information with respect to Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
_provided_ that any non-public information provided to any Person given
such access shall have previously been provided to Parent or shall be
provided (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to Parent prior to or
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and
such Persons Representatives) regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Company and
its Representatives may contact any Person submitting a Company Acquisition
Proposal (that was not the result of a violation of _Section 7.3(a)_) to
clarify and understand the terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal so as to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ that if
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives receives from
any third party (1) any Company Acquisition Proposal or any written
indication that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (2) any request for non-public information relating to
Company or any Company Subsidiary that informs Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made or would
reasonably be expected to relate to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (3)
any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Company
Acquisition Proposal, then Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of
the identity of such third party and provide Parent with a copy of such
Company Acquisition Proposal (including copies of any related debt and equity
financing commitments), indication, inquiry or request or, if not in writing,
a written description of the material terms thereof, and shall keep Parent
informed (orally and, if requested by Parent, in writing) on a reasonably
current basis of the nature, status and material terms of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the withdrawal
or rejection thereof and any amendments or proposed amendments thereto), and
(ii) Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be permitted to continue to
take the necessary steps toward (but without filing any documents with the
SEC or other Governmental Authority publicly announcing or consummating) a
Company Listing Transaction.

 



70 (c) Except as provided in _Sections 7.3(d),_ the Company Board (i) shall
not (A) fail to include in the Proxy Statement, and shall not withdraw (or
modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a written
request by Parent following a Company Acquisition Proposal (or material
modification thereto) becoming publicly known or the commencement of a tender
or exchange offer (or material modification thereto) for any outstanding
shares of capital stock of Company, (C) adopt, approve, or publicly recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, or (D) agree, propose or announce its intention to do
any of the foregoing (each such action set forth in this _Section 7.3(c)(i)_
being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
and (ii) shall not cause or permit Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to enter into any Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause or permit Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal, if (i) the Company
has terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ and promptly
thereafter enters into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement (a "
_Company Superior Proposal Termination_ "), (ii) the Company Acquisition
Proposal was not the result of a violation of _Section 7.3(a)_, and (iii) (A)
Company has provided to Parent a written notice (a " _Notice
of Recommendation Change_ ") detailing the material terms and conditions of
such Company Superior Proposal and including copies of the definitive
agreements (and, if applicable, the debt and equity financing commitments
relating thereto) in the form to be entered into and the identifying the
person or group making such Company Superior Proposal (which notice shall not
be deemed to be, in and of itself, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change),
(B) if requested by Parent, Company negotiates in good faith regarding any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the three (3)
Business Day period immediately following receipt of the Notice of
Recommendation Change (it being agreed that any material amendment to a
material term of such Company Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Recommendation Change), and (C) at the end of the applicable period, after
considering any counter-offer made by Parent, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 



71 (e) Company shall promptly notify Parent if Company determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning a
Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ and shall in no
event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice.

Company Board through its Representatives, directly or indirectly, from (i)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a),
or making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of Company if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that in no event shall this _Section 7.3(f)_ affect
the obligations of Company specified in _Section 7.3(c)_; and _provided_
_further_ that a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer, or inquiry
from any Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated

72  the Company Board determines in good faith (after consulting with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (A) if consummated, would be
more favorable to the stockholders of Company in their capacity as such from
a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

_Organizational Documents_ "), from and after the Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or
during the period from the date hereof through the date of the Merger
Effective Time, as applicable, serving as director, manager, trustee, agent,
fiduciary, advisor, officer or person acting in a similar capacity of
Company, any

 



73  of the Company Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, without the requirement of any bond or
other security; _provided_ that the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for
any amounts paid in settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for
all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim
except to the extent the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that such
Indemnified Party has conflicting interests with one or more other Indemnified
Parties in the outcome of such action (in which event such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and expenses for which
the Surviving Entity shall be liable; _provided_ _further_ that that the
Surviving Entity shall have no obligation hereunder to indemnify
any Indemnified Party for any amounts arising out of actions or omissions by
the Indemnified Party (A) which would not otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant
to applicable provisions of the MGCL (whether or not the MGCL were to apply)
or the terms and conditions of the Company Charter, and (B) unless any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides the Surviving
Entity with (x) a written affirmation of the Indemnified Persons good faith
belief that such Indemnified Person has met the standard of conduct necessary
for indemnification by the Surviving Entity, and (y) a written agreement to
repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Surviving Entity if it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party did not comply with the
requisite standard of conduct and is not entitled to indemnification. The
indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving Entity pursuant
to this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Merger Effective Time, as applicable, and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, trustee, employee, agent, fiduciary or
officer of Company any of the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.5(a)_, (I) the term "
_Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or
proceeding or inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any Party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution

 



74  of any Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to (1) matters that relate
to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, manager, trustee,
agent, fiduciary, advisor, officer or person acting in a similar capacity of
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the extent such person was
serving at the request or for the benefit of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, any other Person, and (2) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (II) the term "
_Claim Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, reasonable travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this _Section 7.5(a)_. The
Surviving Entity shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity
agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing, now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, agents or
fiduciaries of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Organizational
Documents, the Company Advisory Agreement and indemnification agreements of
Company shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years following the
Closing, the organizational documents of the Surviving Entity and any
applicable Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification and limitations on liability of
directors, officers, trustees, agents or fiduciaries than are set forth in
the Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the Closing in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Closing, were directors, officers, trustees, agents or
fiduciaries of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, unless such
modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum
extent required by applicable Law.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, Parent or
the Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to and through the Closing; _provided_ that in lieu
of Parents or the Surviving Entitys obligation hereunder, (i) Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, may substitute therefor policies of an
insurance company with the same or better rating as Companys current
insurance carrier the terms of which, including

 



75  coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers
than Companys existing policies as of the date hereof and which substitute
policies are reasonably acceptable to Company, or (ii) Parent or, in
consultation with Parent, Company may obtain extended reporting period
coverage under Companys or the applicable Company Subsidiarys existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Closing) or purchase a "tail"
policy for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, for a
cost not in excess of 1.75 times the current annual premiums for such
insurance, _provided_ that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required
to pay annual premiums for the applicable tail insurance policy under this
_Section 7.5(c)(ii)_ in excess of 175% of the most recent annual premiums
paid by Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to
the date of this Agreement for such purpose (it being understood that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Entity shall be obligated to acquire and maintain the tail policy related
to Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

(e) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this _Section 7.5_; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent, Company and the Surviving Entity and shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or
her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs)
affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this
_Section 7.5_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise. 

 



76 _Section 7.6_ _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Company and Parent shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective,
as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 8_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents and approvals (but expressly excluding any ISRA Requirements and
Approvals, which are addressed in _Section 7.6(d)_ below) from Governmental
Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
making of all necessary or advisable registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
subject to  _Section 7.7(c)_, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the
avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto will and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any
required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing
the other Parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either Party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement. Except for filings of personal identifying information of Parents,
and its Affiliates, respective directors and officers that are separately
submitted to CFIUS, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted, the
Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and
each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating
to the other and each of their Affiliates that 

 



77  appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate
any sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section 7.6_
as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
trustees of the recipient without the advance written consent of the Party
providing such materials. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither
Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, without giving the other party the opportunity to attend
or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with
such Governmental Authority (except that confidential competitively sensitive
business information may be excluded from such a meeting or conversation).

(c) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, reasonably cooperate in the preparation of any draft and final
notification of the transaction contemplated hereby to CFIUS made in
accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or
branch of the United States government in connection with a CFIUS review or
investigation of the transaction contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to comply with the ISRA
Requirements and Approvals for the ISRA Properties prior to Closing. If
Company is unable to complete the ISRA process prior to the Merger Effective
Time, including by obtaining a response action outcome, with respect to any of
the ISRA Properties, then the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to prepare, execute,
and submit remediation certifications with remediation funding sources and
comply with all other applicable ISRA Requirements and Approvals with respect
to such ISRA Properties as necessary to effectuate the Closing. In furtherance
of the foregoing and notwithstanding any restrictions set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_, the Parties shall assist and cooperate with each other in doing all
things reasonably necessary, proper and advisable to comply with, submit and
obtain all ISRA Requirements and Approvals with respect to each ISRA Property,
including reasonably cooperating with the other Partys Representatives in
connection with ISRA related actions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, completing compliance therewith prior to the Closing. Further,
(i) Company shall draft and deliver to Parent drafts of the general
information notices for each ISRA Property and (ii) subject to Parents
comment with respect to the drafts referred to in clause (i) above and
Parents approval thereof (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Company shall, within five (5) days
hereof,

 



78  deliver to NJDEP such general information notices. In addition, prior to
submitting any other documents to NJDEP required by ISRA, including any
remediation certifications with remediation funding sources (as such terms
are defined or used under ISRA), annual surcharge payments and other NJDEP
forms prior to Closing, Company shall provide such documents to Parent for its
review, comment and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Company shall provide Parent with reasonable advance
notice of any inspections or other activities relating to the ISRA Properties
and Parent and Parents Representatives shall have the opportunity to attend,
and participate in, any such inspections of the ISRA Properties.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep Company reasonably apprised of the
status of the receipt and satisfaction of the matters described on _Schedule
8.2(i)_ , including by promptly (and within two (2) Business Days) informing
Company if Parent has been informed, or has a reasonable basis to believe,
that the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(i)_ will not be satisfied by the
Outside Date.

_Section 7.7_  _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Company, of any
notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Company, if (i)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect such that it would be reasonable
to expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date, or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Company and its
Representatives shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and its
Representatives shall give prompt notice to Company, if, to the Knowledge of
such Party, the occurrence of any state of facts, change, development, event
or condition would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of
the conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction
to be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by Company, Parent or their respective Representatives
to provide such prompt notice under this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall not
constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section
8.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(b)(i)_.

 



79 (c) Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Company, of any
Action commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving such Party or any Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof,
respectively, that relates to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company and its Representatives
shall consult with Parent and give Parent the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent and its
Representatives shall keep Company reasonably informed regarding the defense
and settlement of any litigation against Parent and/or their directors
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

_Section 7.8_ _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time,
Company shall take all such steps to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 _Section 7.9_ _Dividends_. Distributions that have accrued with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Partnership Units at the rate
permitted under the terms of this Agreement and have not been paid prior to
the Closing Date shall be paid to the holders of such shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Partnership Units on the Closing Date immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time.

_Section 7.10_ _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take all action necessary
so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) if any such
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _Section 7.11_ _Tax Representation Letters_. Company shall (i) obtain the
opinion of counsel referred to in  _Section 8.2(f)_, and (ii) deliver to
Greenberg Traurig LLP, special tax counsel to Company, a tax representation
letter, dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Company, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such counsel and Parent,
containing representations of Company for purposes of rendering the opinions
described in _Section 8.2(f)_.

 



80 _Section 7.12_ _Termination of Agreements_. Company shall, and shall cause
all applicable Persons to, terminate (i) all of the Company Related Party
Agreements (other than the Surviving Related Party Agreements) and (ii)
terminate the Company Equity Incentive Plan and Company Private Placement
Equity Incentive Plan, with no further liability of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, other than as set forth in _Section 4.24_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

 _Section 7.13_ _Merger Sub; Subsidiaries_. Parent shall cause each of Merger
Sub and any other applicable Affiliate thereof to comply with and perform all
of its obligations under or relating to this Agreement, including in the case
of Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to
comply with and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this
Agreement.

_Section 7.14_ _Existing Loans_. Company and each Company Subsidiary shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders for each Existing Loan to
deliver a payoff, defeasance or similar notice to Parent, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ "),
prior to the Closing. Pursuant to the Payoff Letters, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause each Existing Loan to be repaid in connection with the Closing and
shall unwind and terminate any interest rate cap, swap, collar or similar
transaction or currency hedging transactions related to any Existing Loan. In
connection with the payoff of each Existing Loan and in accordance with the
Payoff Letters, at the Closing, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall bear and
be responsible for (a) any prepayment premium or defeasance fees assessed by
the applicable lender with respect to such Existing Loan (each, a " _Lender_
"), and associated with such payoff prior to maturity, (b) any breakage or
other fees associated with the unwinding or breakage of any interest rate cap,
swap, collar or similar transaction or currency hedging transactions related
to any Existing Loan, and (c) any other fee, charge, legal fee, cost
or expense incurred by or on behalf of any Party in connection therewith.
Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that it shall each be obligated to
use its reasonable best efforts to provide that each Existing Loan shall be
repaid as of the Closing Date.

_Section 7.15_ _Parent Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to consummate
and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter and negotiating and entering into definitive agreements ("
_Financing Agreements_ ") with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements, and (iii) at the
Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, consummating
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



81 (b) Parent shall keep Company informed on a timely basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing,
including if for any reason Parent has concluded in good faith that it will
not be able to obtain any part of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, and
shall give Company prompt notice (i) of any breach or default by any party to
any Financing Agreements of which Parent becomes aware, and (ii) of the
receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from any Lender with
respect to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement, or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing. As soon as reasonably practicable
after any request by Company in writing, Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested by Company relating to any circumstance referred to in
clauses (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) Except to the extent otherwise contemplated in  _Section 7.15(d)_,
Parent shall not replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter if any such
replacement financing or amendment (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing available on the Closing Date from that contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter (after taking into account the "flex" provisions of any
fee letter), or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Debt Financing or other terms if, with respect to either clause (i) or
(ii) of this sentence, the effect thereof would reasonably be expected to (A)
delay or prevent the Closing, (B) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
less likely to occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights, if any, to specific performance against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter. For purposes of clarification, the foregoing shall
not prohibit Parent from amending the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace
lender(s) (or Affiliates of such lender(s)) as parties thereto. Parent shall
promptly deliver to Company executed copies of any replacements of or
amendments to the Debt Commitment Letter. References in this Agreement to the
" _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include any replacement of amended
financing obtained by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section
7.15(c),_ and references herein to " _Debt Financing_ " shall be deemed to
include such financing.

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 7.15_, in the event
that any portion of the Debt Financing expires by its terms or is terminated
by any of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Lender notifies
Parent or any of its Affiliates of the unwillingness of the Lenders (or any of
them) to proceed with the Debt Financing (an event referred to in
this sentence, a " _Debt Financing Notice Event_ "), Parent shall (i)
promptly notify Company of the Debt Financing Notice Event, and (ii) as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the Debt Financing Notice
Event, use reasonable best efforts to obtain financing from alternative
sources in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable
portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and
to obtain a new 

 



82  financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing
(the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") which shall replace the applicable
existing Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall promptly deliver to Company
true and complete copies of the New Debt Commitment Letter and all other
agreements relating to such Alternate Debt Financing. References in this
Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include any commitment for
Alternate Debt Financing obtained by Parent pursuant to this _Section
7.15(d)_ and references to "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include such
Alternate Debt Financing.

 

(e) Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting
sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing
sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii)
assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) an
offering document, confidential information memoranda or similar documents for
any Debt Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for any Debt Financing to be raised by Parent to complete the Merger,
(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain subordination, non-
disturbance and attornment agreements, accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, appraisals, surveys, title insurance, environmental reports (but,
except as set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_, expressly excluding any subsurface
or invasive environmental testing or sampling and any indoor air quality,
vapor intrusion or Phase II environmental study), estoppels and certificates
from tenants, lenders and ground lessors and other documentation and items
relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Parent, (vi)
providing and executing documents and certificates and customary
representation letters, as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (vii)
cooperating in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any Indebtedness
of Company or any of Company Subsidiaries and the release of any Liens (other
than the Company Permitted Liens described in clauses (i) through (iv) and
(vi) of the definition of "Company Permitted Liens" and any Liens pursuant to
the terms of any Indebtedness of a Joint Venture or a subsidiary thereof) on
the property of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including using
reasonable best efforts to deliver customary payoff, defeasance or similar
notices under any existing mortgage or mezzanine loans of Company or any
Company Subsidiary as reasonably requested by Parent and (viii) subject to
the provisions and restrictions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_, cooperating
in connection with any site visit and/or appraisal of any property related to
the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by Company, reimburse Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, 

 



83  judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to Company or the
Company Subsidiaries) and/or any of the cooperation provided by Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.15(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition
set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, as it applies to Companys obligations under
this _Section 7.15(e)_ shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing
(or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries willful and material breach of its
obligations under this _Section 7.15(e_).

 

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Company and
the Company Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant
to paragraph (e) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(g) For purposes of clarity, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in no

documentation necessary to resolve any clouds on title to any of the

purposes of the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, with
such determination to be set forth in

 



94  an opinion of outside tax counsel to the Recipient, plus (B) such additional
amount that it is estimated can be paid to the Recipient in such taxable year
without creating a risk that the payment would cause the Recipient to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), which determination
shall be made by independent tax accountants to the Recipient, plus (C) if (i)
the Recipient receives a letter from outside tax counsel to the Recipient
indicating that the Recipient has received a ruling from the IRS holding that
the Recipients receipt of the applicable Parent Termination Fee or Company
Expenses Reimbursement Amount either would constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income of the Recipient for purposes of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) the Recipients outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Recipient of
the Parent Termination Fee or Company Expenses Reimbursement Amount should
either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income of
the Recipient for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, the
remaining balance of such Parent Termination Fee or Company Expenses
Reimbursement Amount. Any amount of any Parent Termination Fee or Company
Expenses Reimbursement Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable
year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitation of this paragraph, _provided_ that
no such payment need be made after the fifth anniversary of the date of
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Recipient shall cease to
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the entire unpaid balance
of any Parent Termination Fee or Company Expenses Reimbursement Amount shall
be payable immediately.

 

(g) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If a Party fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_,  _Section 9.3(c)_, _Section 9.3(d)_ or
_Section 9.3(e)_, as applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, a
Party commences a suit that results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in
_Section 9.3(b)_,  _Section 9.3(c)_, _Section 9.3(d)_ or _Section
9.3(e)_, as applicable, Company shall pay to Parent (in the case of an
enforcement of amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section
9.3(c)_), or Parent shall pay to Company (in the case of an enforcement of
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(d)_ or _Section 9.3(e)_), its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in _Sections 9.3(b)_ , _Section 9.3(c)_, _Section 9.3(d)_ or
_Section 9.3(e)_, as applicable, from the date of that the applicable
payment was required to be made through the actual date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to six percent (6%).

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Company (on
behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Financing, the

 



95  Financing Agreements or in respect of any other document any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
and Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to commence
any action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the Financing
Agreements or in respect of any other document or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause
any such action or proceeding asserted by Company (on behalf of itself and any
of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing, the Financing Agreements or in respect of any other document or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity
against any Debt Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged
and agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any
claims or damages to the Company in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the Financing Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The provisions of this _Section
9.3(h)_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt
Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this _Section 9.3(h)_.

 

 _Section 9.4_ _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by the Company Board and the Parent Board, respectively,
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and
prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock,
or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the stockholders
of Company without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ _further_
that no Party shall be entitled to amend or waive this _Section 9.4_ or
_Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3(d)_, _Section 9.3(h)_, _Section 10.5_,
_Section 10.7_, _Section 10.8_,  _Section 10.9_, _Section 10.10_ or

_Section 10.3_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
present or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that
jurisdiction, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or 

 



98  unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party, and
(d) such terms or other provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the
Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

 _Section 10.4_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the
other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in
"portable document form" (" _pdf_ "), or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper
document bearing the original signature.

_Section 10.5_ _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Company Disclosure Letter), the
Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, except for the provisions of _Section 3.1_ (which,
from and after the Merger Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time),  _Section 3.5_ (which, from and after the Merger Effective Time,
shall be for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Restricted Stock),
_Section 7.5_ (which, from and after the Merger Effective Time shall be for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties) and this _Section 10.5_, _Section
9.2_, _Section 9.3(g)_, _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.8_, _Section 10.9_,
_Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.11_ (which shall be for the benefit of the
Debt Financing Sources, their respective Affiliates and their respective
successors and permitted assigns who are intended third party beneficiaries
thereunder). The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.6_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Accordingly, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



99 _Section 10.6_ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the Parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

_Section 10.7_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to
its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Parties agrees that (a) any interpretation of any commitment letters,
including the Debt Commitment Letter, related to the Debt Financing and all
matters relating thereto shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York,
and (b) that the provisions of _Section 10.11_ regarding a waiver of jury
trial shall apply to any such action, proceeding, cross-claim or third party
claim.

 

 _Section 10.8_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each Party irrevocably agrees (i) to submit itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Business and Technology Case Management Program of the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland (the " _Maryland Courts_ ") for the
purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly
or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this
Agreement, (ii) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) that it will
not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in
any court other than the Maryland Courts, and (iv) that a final judgment in
any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.8(a)_ to the contrary, each of
the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any legal action, suit
or proceeding (whether at

 



100  law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any related
financing), including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any
New York State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York and
the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

_Section 10.9_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided
that (y) Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder
to one or more Affiliates of Parent or to one or more entities in which Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent directly or indirectly invests and (z) each of
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights under this Agreement
to its financing sources as collateral security; provided further that no such
assignment, delegation or other transfer of rights or obligations by Parent
shall relieve Parent of any liability or obligation hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

_Section 10.10_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , each Party shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, in addition
to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that Company shall not be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically the Debt
Financing or the closing of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Debt Financing) in accordance with _Article 8_ hereof
and that the sole and exclusive remedy of Company relating to the failure of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be the remedies set forth in _Section 9.3_ and the Guarantee.

_Section 10.11_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,

 



101  SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

_Section 10.12_ _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party.
Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 

 _Section 10.13_ _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument
delivered in connection herewith, by execution hereof, each of the Parties
covenants, agrees and acknowledges it has no, and no other Person has any,
rights of recovery whatsoever under this Agreement against, or any claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, any transaction under or in connection with this Agreement, or in
respect of any representations (whether written or oral) made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith, against, and no personal liability whatsoever
shall attach to, be imposed upon or be incurred by, any former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, advisors, representatives, Affiliates, members, managers or general
or limited partners of any of the Parties or any former, current or future
stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, member, manager, advisors, representatives, Affiliate or
agent of any of the foregoing (each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), through such
Party or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of such Party or
otherwise against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, in each case, other than rights of
recovery and claim that a Party has (a) against another Party (or its
successors or assigns, including the Liquidating Entity) pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, or any agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Contribution Agreement, Purchase Agreement and the Transition
Services Agreement, (b) from Guarantor (but not any other Non-Recourse Party)
under the Guarantee, and (c) in respect of the Confidentiality Agreement or
the Access Agreement (the claims described in clauses (a), (b), and (c), the
" _Non-Prohibited Claims_ "). Each of the Parties hereby covenants and agrees
that it shall not institute, and it shall cause its Affiliates not to
institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
except for Non-Prohibited Claims.

 _Form of Company REIT Qualification Opinion_

 

 , 2015 

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are acting as special tax counsel to Industrial Income Trust, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the merger of the
Company with and into [Merger Sub], a Delaware limited liability company and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Logistics II, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (respectively "Merger Sub" and "Parent"), with
Merger Sub as the surviving company in the merger (the "Merger"). The Merger
will be consummated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
July 28, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"). This opinion letter is being delivered
pursuant to Section 7.2(f) of the Merger Agreement. We are rendering this
opinion letter regarding the qualification of the Company as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). All capitalized terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement.

In preparing this opinion letter, we have reviewed and are expressly relying
upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) the truth and
accuracy of the factual statements, representations and warranties, and
covenants contained in (i) the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits and
schedules thereto), (ii) the tax representation letters of the Company
delivered to us for purposes of this opinion letter (the "Officers
Certificate"), and (iii) such other documents and corporate records as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter or
otherwise have considered relevant to our analysis. Our opinion letter is
based solely on the information and representations in such documents.

 

For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed (i) the Merger will be
consummated in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the
provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Merger will be effective under the
laws of each of the State of Maryland and the State of Delaware and each of
the parties to the Merger Agreement will comply with all reporting obligations
with respect to the Merger required under the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder; (ii) the genuineness of all signatures on documents we
have examined; (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals; (iv) the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies; (v) the conformity, to the extent relevant to our
opinions, of final documents to all documents submitted to us as drafts; (vi)
the authority and capacity of the individual or individuals who executed any
such documents on behalf of any person; (vii) due execution and delivery of
all such documents by all the parties thereto; (viii) the compliance of each
party with all material provisions of such documents, and (ix) the accuracy
and completeness of all records made available to us. Further, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the factual
representations set forth in the Officers Certificate are true, accurate,
complete and correct in all respects up to and including the effective date of
the Merger, and no actions have been taken or will be taken which are
inconsistent with such factual statements, descriptions, representations,
warranties, or covenants which make any such descriptions, representations,
warranties, or covenants untrue, incomplete or incorrect as of the effective
date of the Merger; (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries have operated in a
manner that make the representations contained in the Officers Certificate
and the description of the Company and its subsidiaries and their proposed
activities in the Registration Statement true for all periods through
the effective date of the Merger, (iii) all factual statements, descriptions,
representations, warranties, and covenants contained in any of the documents
referred to herein (including, without limitation, the Officers Certificate)
or otherwise made to us are true, complete and correct in all respects and
will remain true, complete and correct in all respects up to and including the
effective date of the Merger, and no actions have been taken or will be taken
which are inconsistent with such factual statements, descriptions,
representations, warranties, or covenants which make any such descriptions,
representations, warranties, or covenants untrue, incomplete or incorrect as
of the effective date of the Merger; (iv) any statements, representations or
warranties made in any of the documents referred to herein qualified as to
knowledge or belief or similarly qualified are true, complete and correct in
all respects and will continue to be true, complete and correct in all
respects at all times up to and including the effective date of the Merger, in
each case without such qualification; and (each of the parties to the Merger
Agreement will comply with all reporting obligations with respect to
the Merger required under the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

Any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the aforementioned statements,
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or assumptions, could
adversely affect our opinions. In particular, the failure of any of the
aforementioned statements, representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or assumptions to be true as of the effective date of the Merger could cause
the opinions set forth below to be invalid. Similarly, any change in
applicable law between the date hereof and the effective date of the Merger
could also cause the opinions set forth below to be invalid. No ruling has
been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service by any party to the
Merger Agreement as to the United States federal income tax consequences of
any aspect of the Merger.

 

For purposes of our opinions set forth herein, although we have discussed the
Officers Certificate with the signatories thereto, we have not made an
independent investigation of the facts, representations, and covenants set
forth in the Officers Certificate or in any other document, including,
without limitation, representations relating to the sufficiency of
distributions made to shareholders for the Companys short taxable year
ending on the date of  the Merger. Consequently, we have assumed, and relied on the Companys
representations, that the information presented in the Officers Certificate
and other documents accurately and completely describe all material facts
relevant to our opinion. We have assumed that such representations are true
without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. Our opinions
are conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such
statements, representations and covenants. Any material change or inaccuracy
in the facts referred to, set forth, or assumed herein or in the Officers
Certificate may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

 

The opinions expressed herein are given as of the date hereof and are based
upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, current
administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and existing
judicial decisions, any of which could be changed at any time, possibly on a
retroactive basis. Any such changes could adversely affect the
opinions rendered herein. In addition, as noted above, our opinions are based
solely on the documents that we have examined and the representations that
have been made to us and cannot be relied upon if any of the facts contained
in such documents or in such additional information is, or later becomes,
inaccurate or if any of the representations made to us are, or later become,
inaccurate. We are not aware, however, of any facts or circumstances contrary
to or inconsistent with the information, assumptions, and representations we
have relied on for purposes of this opinion. Our opinions are limited to the
U.S. federal income tax matters specifically covered herein. We have not
opined on any other tax consequences to the Company or any other person.
Further, we express no opinion with respect to other federal laws or the laws
of any other jurisdiction.

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set
forth herein, we are of the opinion that for all taxable periods commencing
with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010 through its taxable year ended
December 31, 2014, the Company has been organized and operated in conformity
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code,
and for the period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending with the Closing, its
organization and method of operation has enabled it to meet the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.

Utilizing any savings provisions could require the Company to pay significant
penalty or excise taxes. An opinion of counsel merely represents counsels
best judgment with respect to the probable outcome on the merits and is not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. There can be no
assurance that positions contrary to our opinion will not be taken by the
Internal Revenue Service or that a court considering the issues would not hold
contrary to our opinion. No opinions other than those expressly contained
herein may be inferred or implied. Also, we undertake no obligation to update
this opinion letter, or to ascertain after the date hereof whether
circumstances occurring after such date may affect the conclusions set forth
herein. This opinion letter is being furnished to you in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This opinion letter may not
be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior
written consent.

    Very truly yours,

domain by no fault or wrongful act of Service Provider, (ii) not related to
the Company Entities and was independently developed by Service Provider or
any other Persons without the use of any Confidential Information for, or is
applicable or otherwise available to, other Affiliates of the Black Creek
Group, LLC, or (iii) approved for release by written authorization of Service
Recipient and/or the third party owner of the disclosed information. The
Parties further acknowledge and agree that Confidential Information may be
disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement or order of a court or
governmental agency, provided that, upon Service Providers request for such
a disclosure, Service Provider gives prompt notice thereof to Service
Recipient (unless such notice is not possible under the circumstances, and in
such event, such notice shall be provided as promptly as possible thereafter)
so that Service Recipient may have the opportunity to intervene and contest
such disclosure and/or seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or
as otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including as
required in any securities law filings or offering documentation).

(d) All Confidential Information transmitted or disclosed hereunder will be
and remain the property of Service Recipient, and Service Provider shall (at
Service Recipients election) promptly destroy or return to Service Recipient,
as directed by Service Recipient, any and all copies thereof upon termination
or expiration of this Agreement, or upon the written request of Service
Recipient; _provided_ , _that_ , Service Provider shall not be required to
destroy any Confidential Information that is stored solely as a result of a
backup created in the ordinary course of business and is not readily
destroyable or that is stored on the computers of the personnel of Service
Provider and/or its Affiliates and subject to deletion after a period of one-
hundred and eighty (180) days in accordance with Service Providers and/or
its Affiliates electronic information management practices (subject to
extended retention by Service Providers or its Affiliates compliance and
legal department personnel in accordance with the existing document
retention/destruction policy of Service Provider and/or its Affiliates). Upon
the request of Service Recipient, Service Provider shall certify any such
applicable destruction in writing.

 

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, given the unique and proprietary
nature of the Confidential Information, monetary damages may not be
calculable or a sufficient remedy for any breach of this _Section 5.01_ by
Service Provider or its Affiliates, and that Service Recipient may suffer
great and irreparable injury as a consequence of such breach. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach,
Service Recipient shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief (including, but
not limited to, injunction and specific performance) in order to remedy such
breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be
exclusive remedies for a breach by Service Provider or its Affiliates but
shall be in addition to any and all other remedies provided hereunder or
available at law or equity to Service Recipient.

 



12 Section 5.02 _Non-Solicitation by Service Provider; Other Activities of
Service Provider_.

(a) During the Term and for ninety (90) days thereafter, in no event will any
personnel of Service Provider or its Affiliates who are actively engaged in
the provision of Services hereunder intentionally or actively solicit tenants
at any Company Property (or any properties that are the subject of this
Agreement) (the " _Subject Properties_ ") to move from such Subject Property
or directly or indirectly assist in any such efforts or actively seek to place
a Person known to be actively considering becoming a tenant of any Subject
Property at any property other than a Subject Property without the prior
written consent of Service Recipient; _provided_ , _that_ , Service Provider
and its Affiliates may respond to requests for proposals from prospective
tenants that Service Recipient or its Affiliates is also pursuing and/or
any tenant representative brokers and engage in discussions and negotiations
in furtherance thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 5.02(a)_ to the contrary, if an existing tenant of
a Subject Property and/or tenant representative broker has notified Service
Provider or Service Recipient that such tenant intends to not extend its lease
at a Subject Property, intends to exercise a termination option for a Subject
Property, or intends to seek different space and such tenant cannot be
accommodated by another Subject Property, then Service Provider may make a
proposal to such tenant and/or tenant representative broker for alternative
space that is not a Subject Property, provided that Service Provider gives
reasonable notice to Service Recipient of its intention do so; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _that_ , Service Provider and its Affiliates shall not use, nor
shall Service Provider permit the use of, any Confidential Information
(including the rent rolls of the Subject Properties) or other information or
materials obtained by Service Provider in conjunction with its performance of
the Services to compete, directly or indirectly, with the Subject Properties,
including any response to requests for proposals from prospective tenants
and/or tenant representative brokers otherwise permitted by this _Section
5.02_.

 

(b) During the Term, Service Provider and its Affiliates agree to not solicit
the employment of any personnel then currently employed by Service Recipient
or any of its Affiliates (a " _Service Recipient Employee_ ") on its own
behalf or on behalf of any other business enterprise; _provided_ , _that_ ,
nothing in this _Section 5.02_ shall preclude Service Provider or its
Affiliates from hiring any Service Recipient Employee who (i) contacts Service
Provider or its Affiliates on his or her own initiative, (ii) responds to a
general solicitation of employment 

 



13  through an advertisement not specifically directed at Service Recipient or
its Affiliates or Service Recipient Employees, or (iii) is referred to Service
Provider or its Affiliates through a search firm, employment agency, or
similar entities provided such entities have not been specifically instructed
to solicit Service Recipient Employees by Service Provider or its Affiliates.

 

(c) Service Recipient acknowledges that Service Provider and its Affiliates
are or may be engaged in the same or a similar business as Service Recipient
and/or its Affiliates, and may have activities, operations and investments and
pursue business opportunities that compete with the operations and business of
Service Recipient and/or its Affiliates. Subject to the
confidentiality obligations contained in _Section 5.01_ and the non-
solicitation obligations contained in this _Section 5.02_, Service Recipient
agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement (other than _Sections 5.01_
 and _5.02_ hereof) shall restrict Services Provider or any of its
Affiliates from conducting or being involved in any activity or business
opportunity whatsoever, for its own account or for the account of another
Person, or shall require Service Provider or any of its Affiliates to make
any business opportunity available to Service Recipient, in any case, even if
such activity or business opportunity competes with the business of Service
Recipient or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 5.03 _Non-Solicitation by Service Recipient_. During the Term, Service
Recipient and its Affiliates agree to not solicit the employment of any
personnel then currently employed by Service Provider or any of its Affiliates
(a " _Service Provider Employee_ ") on its own behalf or on behalf of any
other business enterprise; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing in this _Section
5.03_ shall preclude Service Recipient or its Affiliates from hiring any
Service Provider Employee who (i) contacts Service Recipient or its Affiliates
on his or her own initiative, (ii) responds to a general solicitation of
employment through an advertisement not specifically directed at Service
Provider or its Affiliates or Service Provider Employees, or (iii) is referred
to Service Recipient or its Affiliates through a search firm,
employment agency, or similar entities provided such entities have not been
specifically instructed to solicit Service Provider Employees by Service
Recipient or its Affiliates.

(a) Service Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Service Provider
and its Affiliates and their respective managers, members, partners,
shareholders, officers, directors, employees, consultants, subcontractors and
agents (each, a " _Service Provider Indemnified Party_ ") against any and all
costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of third
party claims (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, interest,
penalties and costs of investigation or preparation for defense), judgments,
fines, interest, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, demands, assessments
and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ "), in each case,
based on, arising out of, resulting from, or in connection with: (i) any

the part of Service Recipient, (iv) a Service Provider Indemnified Partys
performance pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and or adherence to
written instructions given by Service Recipient, or (v) any act or failure to
act by Service Recipient or by any third party not under the control of
Service Provider to the extent the Losses relate to the subject matter of
this Agreement, in each case, except to the extent such Losses are sustained
or suffered arising out of, in connection with, based on, or by virtue of bad
faith, negligence or willful misconduct of Service Provider or
its Affiliates.

(b) Service Provider agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Service Recipient
and its Affiliates and their respective managers, members, partners,

tangible property and/or personal injury caused by Service Provider or its

Section 7.02 _Procedure_.

 

(a) If any Action shall be brought against any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ (the " _Indemnitees_ ") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Person who is an
indemnitor hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), such Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the relevant Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ , _that_ , the
failure to provide such notice shall not affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to receive indemnification for Losses to the extent that the Indemnifying
Partys rights in relation to such Action are not materially prejudiced. The
Indemnitee shall be entitled to conduct the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the Indemnitee notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing of
Indemnitees intent to conduct such defense within fifteen (15) days
following the delivery of the initial notice of the Action. If Indemnitee does
not deliver such written notice of its intent to conduct the defense of such
Action prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its election, to assume the
defense of such Action. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
of any such Action:

 

(1) the Indemnifying Party shall agree in writing to fully indemnify the
Indemnitee with respect to any losses from such Action;

 

(2) the Indemnifying Party shall proceed to defend such Action in a diligent
manner with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee at its sole
expense;

 



16 (3) the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any non-
privileged documents and materials in the possession of the Indemnitee that
may be necessary to the defense of such Actions;

(4) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Action;

(5) the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate, at its sole cost and
expense, in the defense of such Action; and

(6) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle, adjust or compromise such Action
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee; which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 

(b) If the Indemnitee proceeds with the defense of any Action:

 

(1) all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such Action (whether or
not incurred by the Indemnitee) shall be borne and paid exclusively by the
Indemnifying Party as such expenses are incurred;

(2) the Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnitee any
documents and materials in the possession or control of the Indemnifying Party
that may be necessary to the defense of such Action;

 

(3) the Indemnitee shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Action; and

 

(4) the Indemnitee shall not settle, adjust or compromise such Action without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

Section 7.03 _Other Indemnification Matters_.

 

(a) The indemnity agreement contained in this _Article VII_ shall remain
operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee, Indemnifying Party, their directors,
officers, employees or agents and (ii) termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other in a reasonable manner with respect to access to
unprivileged information and similar matters in connection with any Action.
The provisions of this _Article VII_ are for the benefit of, and are intended
to create third party beneficiary rights in favor of, each of the
Indemnitees referred to herein.

(c) Recovery for any claim as to which Service Recipient is entitled to seek
indemnification hereunder shall first be pursued against the insurance policy
contemplated by

 



17  Section 8.04. To the extent coverage under such policy is exhausted or
otherwise not available, the amount of such claim not covered by such policy
shall constitute a claim for indemnification against Service Provider. Any
unsatisfied indemnification payments owing from Service Provider to Service
Recipient may be satisfied by offset as contemplated by Section 7.04.

 

Section 7.04 _Limitation of Liability_. The Parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Services are provided by Service Provider with the expectation
that Service Provider is not assuming any express or implied obligation, or
control over Service Recipients or any of its Affiliates decision-making
authority, financial or operational risks, except for those risks explicitly
set forth herein. ACCORDINGLY, SERVICE RECIPIENT AND ITS AFFILIATES AGREE THAT
SERVICE PROVIDER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
MANAGERS, PARTNERS, OWNERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES,
CONSULTANTS, CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS, SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS. IN NO
EVENT SHALL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ITS AFFILIATES LIABILITY RELATED TO
SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM
COMPENSATION TO SERVICE PROVIDER BY SERVICE RECIPIENT HEREUNDER. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SERVICE PROVIDER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SERVICES TO BE
PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, any
obligations or liabilities of Service Provider pursuant to this Agreement,
whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the
obligations and liabilities of Service Provider, and no individual employee or
personnel of Service Provider or its Affiliates shall be obligated personally
for any such obligation or liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if Service Provider commits an error with respect to or
incorrectly performs or fails to perform any Service, at Service Recipients
request within a reasonable time thereafter, Service Provider shall use
reasonable efforts and in good faith attempt to correct such error, re-perform
or perform such Service at no additional cost to Service Recipient. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of any unsatisfied indemnification claims for
which Service Provider is liable hereunder may be offset by Service Recipient
against the aggregate maximum compensation to Service Provider by Service
Recipient under _Article III_.

ARTICLE VIII

solely and exclusively available for claims made under the terms of this
Agreement and the Services provided hereunder. On or prior to the date hereof

20 ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.01 _Force Majeure; Service Interruption_. No Party shall be
responsible for the delay or inability to perform any obligation hereunder
due to accidents, fires, storms, floods, earthquake, wars, acts of terrorism,
acts of governments, strikes or lockouts, governmental requirements and
regulations, restrictions imposed by law or any other similar
conditions, beyond the reasonable control of such Party (a " _Force Majeure
Event_ "), and the time for performance, or inability to perform a Service, by
such Party shall be extended by the period of such delay; _provided_ , _that_
, such Service will be performed or satisfied as soon as reasonably
practicable after the termination of the relevant circumstances causing such
failure or delay. Service Provider will promptly notify Service Recipient,
either orally or in writing, upon learning of the occurrence of such Force
Majeure Event or other disruption. If a disruption of any Service occurs,
Service Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to restore such
Services in a manner consistent with the manner in consistent with such
Partys restoration of such Services for its own business (and without any
priority given to the provision of a similar service to its own entities or
business). If such suspension of Services has a negative impact on Service
Recipients business operations and Service Provider cannot readily reinstate
the relevant Service, Service Provider will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Service Recipient in securing alternative services to
minimize such negative impact on Service Recipient.

Section 10.02 _Assignment_. Neither Party may assign this Agreement (or any of
its rights hereunder) without the other Partys prior written consent, except
that Service Recipient may assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) (a) to
one or more of its Affiliates and (b) in connection with a sale, transfer or
other disposition of all or a material portion of its assets (each a "
_Permitted Assignee_ "). Any assignment or transfer in violation of the
foregoing assignment provision shall be void. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 10.03 _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to render any Party an agent of any other Party and or grant any
Party any authority to bind any other Party, transact any business in any
other Partys name or on its behalf, or make any promises or representations
on behalf of any other Party unless provided for in an Exhibit or agreed to
in writing. Each Party will perform all of its respective obligations under
this Agreement as an independent contractor, and no joint venture, partnership
or other relationship shall be created or implied by this Agreement.

 

Section 10.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced
under and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

 



21 Section 10.05 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) Subject to, and after observance of, the terms of _Section 1.08_, the
Parties shall resolve all disputes arising out of, concerning, or related to
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute relating to the
interpretation, performance, breach or termination of this Agreement
(collectively, a " _Dispute_ "), by binding arbitration administered by the
ICC International Court of Arbitration (the " _ICC Court_ ") in accordance
with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in
force at the time of commencement of arbitration (the " _ICC Rules_ "). The
Parties agree that:

(1) the legal seat and place of arbitration shall be New York, New York;

 

(2) the language of the arbitration shall be English;

 

(3) the number of arbitrators shall be three (3) (the " _Tribunal_ "), with
one arbitrator to be nominated by the claimant and one (1) to be nominated by
the respondent. The claimant shall nominate its arbitrator within ten (10)
days after it commences arbitration; the respondent shall nominate its
arbitrator within twenty (20) days after the commencement of arbitration. The
third arbitrator, who shall be the chairman of the Tribunal, shall be
nominated by the two (2) appointed arbitrators within twenty (20) days after
the respondents arbitrator is nominated. No claimant or respondent shall be
entitled to nominate more than one (1) arbitrator; thus, to the extent a party
to an arbitration is both a claimant and a respondent (e.g., if a respondent
asserts counter-claims or cross-claims), that party shall only be entitled
to nominate an arbitrator in connection with the partys initial status as
either a claimant or respondent. If any of the three (3) arbitrators is not
nominated within the time prescribed above, the ICC Court shall appoint such
arbitrator; and

(4) discovery shall be limited to specific and identifiable documents and/or
narrow and specific categories of documents applicable to the Dispute being
arbitrated pursuant to the terms hereof and ordered by the arbitrators in
accordance with the International Bar Associations Rules on the Taking of
Evidence in International Arbitration.

 

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Section 10.05_ and
the ICC Rules, the provisions of this  _Section 10.05_ shall prevail.

The Tribunal shall issue its final award within one (1) year of its
appointment by the ICC Court; provided, however, that if the Tribunal
determines that it is unable despite its best efforts to meet such time limit
consistent with its primary duty to justly determine the Dispute, it may
extend such time limit in three (3) month increments.

 

(b) All Disputes shall be resolved in a confidential manner. The arbitrators
shall agree to hold any information received during the arbitration in the
strictest of confidence and shall not disclose to any non-party the existence,
contents or results of the arbitration or any other information about such
arbitration other than as may be required by applicable law or as 

 



22  necessary to determine the Dispute before the Tribunal. No Party shall
disclose or permit the disclosure of any information about the evidence
adduced or the documents produced by the other party in the arbitration
proceedings or about the existence, contents or results of the proceeding
except in accordance with _Article IV_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, any Party may seek injunctive relief
or specific performance from the federal or state courts in New York, New
York with respect to breaches by any other Party of the confidentiality
requirements contained in this _Section 10.05_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement.

 

(c) The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs in
connection with the arbitration, as determined by the Tribunal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event the Tribunal determines that there was no
prevailing party, the Tribunal shall determine the allocation between the
Parties of the costs of the arbitration. Each party to the arbitration shall
bear its own attorneys fees.

(d) Except as otherwise specifically prohibited herein, any Party will be
entitled to enforce any rights specifically to recover damages caused by
reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights at law and in equity, and the Tribunal shall have the power to
award all remedies in law or equity available under the governing law.

(e) Prior to the appointment of the Tribunal, any Party shall have the right
to have recourse to Emergency Measures under the Emergency Arbitrator Rules
in accordance with the ICC Rules. In the event that (i) it is necessary to
give effect to interim or conservatory measures issued by the Emergency
Arbitrator or Tribunal, or (ii) the Emergency Arbitrator Procedure is for any
reason unavailable, the Parties may apply to a federal or state court in New
York, New York for interim or protective measures (e.g., temporary restraining
orders or preliminary injunctions) against any other party, provided that no
such application to a judicial authority may be made unless either condition
(i) or (ii) of this subsection is satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Emergency Arbitrator Procedure shall not be deemed unavailable if
an Emergency Arbitrator denies a request for Emergency Measures. Subject to
the foregoing, the application to a judicial authority for such measures or
for the implementation of any such measures shall not be deemed to be an
infringement or a waiver of this arbitration procedure and shall not affect
the relevant powers reserved to the Tribunal.

(f) The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the Parties
to the arbitration and enforceable in accordance with the New York Convention
on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. The Parties hereto
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located
in New York, New York for the resolution of any dispute or enforcement of any
right arising out of or relating to this agreement to arbitrate, including
enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate and confirmation or enforcement of
any award rendered by the arbitrators pursuant to this agreement to
arbitrate, and the Parties waive any objection to the venue or personal
jurisdiction of said courts.

 

(g) Absent a preliminary or interim order to the contrary from an Emergency
Arbitrator, the Tribunal, or a federal or state court in New York, New York,
the mere existence

 



23  of a Dispute or arbitration between the Parties shall not relieve any Party
of its obligations under this Agreement, and all Parties shall continue to
perform their obligations under the Agreement pending a final decision by the
Tribunal; _provided_ , _that_ , Service Provider shall not be required to
continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement if Service Recipient
has not cured or taken tangible action to cure any alleged breach within
sixty (60) days.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit

"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof , "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein
means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments)
by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 10.10 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be
deemed to be an original and

 



26  all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument
binding upon the Parties hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile
signatures shall be deemed originals, and the Parties agree to exchange
original signatures as promptly as possible.

Section 10.11 _Further Cooperation_. Each Party agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the others, at any other Partys request, in order to carry out
the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.12 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto) may not be amended or modified except by a writing
signed by an authorized signatory of Service Provider and each Service
Recipient, provided that any Exhibit or Schedule may be amended or modified by
a writing signed by an authorized signatory of Service Recipient
receiving Services under such Exhibit or Schedule and of Service Provider
providing Services under such Exhibit or Schedule. No waiver by any Party or
any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
preceding or subsequent breach or default.

warrants that its signatory whose signature appears below has been and is on
the date of this Agreement duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
appropriate action to execute this Agreement.

LAW, EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTER ARISING HEREUNDER.

 

Section 10.15 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several
articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for reference only and
shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

Section 10.16 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to grant any Person not a Party, or a permitted assignee of a
Party to this Agreement, any rights or powers whatsoever, and no person or
entity shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.17 _Relationship of Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed or deemed by the Parties or any third party as creating the
relationship of a real estate broker or agent between the Parties. The Parties
further acknowledge and agree that no provision contained herein, and no act
of the Parties, shall be deemed to vest any rights, interests or claims of
any Party and/or its Affiliates against another Party and/or its Affiliates
under any state or other applicable real estate broker licensing laws.
