outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception
Shares, shall be converted into and constitute the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of
Section 3.01(c) and Section 3.01(d), either (i) the Per Share Stock
Consideration or (ii) cash in the amount equal to the Per Share Consideration
(the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "). The calculations required by this
Section 3.01(a) shall be prepared jointly by Zions and Amegy prior to the
Closing Date.

 



(b) _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. Each Exception Share shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor except as
provided in Section 3.05. Each share of Amegy Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception
Shares, is hereinafter defined as an " _Old Share_." Old Shares shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (an " _Old Certificate_ ") formerly representing
Old Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares, except the right to receive, as applicable, without interest, upon
exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III (i) any
dividends with respect to Amegy Common Stock with a record date prior to the
Effective Time but unpaid as of the Effective Time and (ii) the consideration
to which he or she may be entitled pursuant to this Article III.



(c)  _Election Procedures_. (1) An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials in such form as Zions and Amegy shall mutually
agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed thirty-five days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as Amegy and Zions shall
mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Amegy
Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day prior to
the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").



(2) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and



 

11 instructions) to specify (A) the number of shares of such holders Amegy
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock Election Shares_ "), (B) the number of
shares of such holders Amegy Common Stock with respect to which such holder
elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Cash Election Shares_
") or (C) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders
Amegy Common Stock (" _No Election Shares_ "). Any Amegy Common Stock with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly
completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., on the 30th day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Zions and Amegy may mutually
agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall also be deemed to be No Election
Shares.



(3) Zions shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by any person who becomes a holder (or beneficial
owner) of Amegy Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and
Amegy shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary
for it to perform as specified herein.



(4) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Old Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Amegy
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form, only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.
In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline,
unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form is submitted and actually
received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the shares of Amegy
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No Election
Shares and Zions shall cause the Old Certificates to be promptly returned
without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of Zions regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Zions nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.



 

12 (5) Within ten business days after the Effective Time, Zions shall cause the
Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Amegy Common
Stock of rights to receive Zions Common Stock or cash in the Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



(A) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the aggregate cash amount that would otherwise
be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares (which,
for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the amount of cash that may be
payable to Dissenting Shareholders determined as of the Effective Time
(assuming that all shares of Amegy Common Stock held by such shareholders are
to be paid in cash an amount equal to the Per Share Consideration)) is greater
than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:



 

(I) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, 



(II) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock Designated Shares_ ") such
that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as
closely as practicable the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Stock
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration, and



(III) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.



(B) _Cash Undersubscribed_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the amount of cash that may be payable to
Dissenting Shareholders determined as of the Effective Time (assuming that all
shares of Amegy Common Stock held by such shareholders are to be paid in cash
an amount equal to the Per Share Consideration)) is less than the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, then:



(I) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,



(II) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares, by a random selection process, and then (if necessary) from among the
Stock



 

13 Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of
shares to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Cash Designated
Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all
Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration, and



(III) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



(C) _Cash Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares (which, for
this purpose, shall be deemed to include the amount of cash that may be
payable to Dissenting Shareholders determined as of the Effective
Time (assuming that all shares of Amegy Common Stock held by such
shareholders are to be paid in cash an amount equal to the Per Share
Consideration)) is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent)
to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then subparagraphs (A) and (B) above
shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and
No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by
Zions and Amegy.



(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a
sufficient number of Cash Election Shares may be converted into the right to
receive Per Share Stock Consideration, but only to the extent necessary, to
secure the tax opinions required by Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c).



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Zions
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Zions Common Stock shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Amegy Common
Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the Zions Share Price. No
such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights
in respect of any fractional share.



 

14 3.02. _Exchange of Old Certificates; Payment of the Consideration_.



(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Until the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Zions shall make available on a timely basis or cause to be
made available to an exchange agent agreed upon by Zions and Amegy (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") (1) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Exchange
Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant to this Article III
and (2) certificates, or at Zions option, evidence of shares in book entry
form, representing the shares of Zions Common Stock (" _New Certificates_ "),
each to be given to the holders of Amegy Common Stock in exchange for Old
Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Upon such anniversary, any such
cash or New Certificates remaining in the possession of the Exchange
Agent (together with any earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to
Zions. Any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or
her Old Certificates pursuant to this Article III shall thereafter be entitled
to look exclusively to Zions, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the
consideration to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old
Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder
of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than ten days thereafter, Zions shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Amegy Common Stock and who theretofore has not submitted
such holders Old Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration
to which such person may be entitled pursuant to this Article III. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.01(c) and upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal or Election Form, as the case may be,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Old Certificate shall promptly be provided in exchange
therefor, but in no event later than ten business days after due surrender, a
New Certificate and/or a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article III, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any
property to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates.



(c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash payment is to
be made in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the making of such payment of the Per Share Cash
Consideration in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting person, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable. If any



 

15 New Certificate representing shares of Zions Common Stock is to be issued in
the name of other than the registered holder of the Old Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Old Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Zions Common Stock in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or
requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d)  _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time with respect to Zions Common Stock shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III. After the
surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Zions Common Stock represented by the New
Certificate.



(e) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Old Shares.



(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the
consideration deliverable in respect of the Old Shares formerly represented by
such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article III.



3.03. _Adjustments to Zions Common Stock_. If Zions changes (or Zions Board
of Directors sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective
Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Zions Common
Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, then the Exchange
Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.



3.04. _Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. 



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding option to purchase shares of Amegy
Common Stock, whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable (each,
an " _Amegy Stock_



 

16 _Option_ "), each Amegy Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised,
whether vested or unvested, immediately prior thereto shall be deemed to
constitute an option (a " _New Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the terms of the stock option plan under
which the Amegy Stock Option was granted, such number of shares of Zions
Common Stock and at such an exercise price per share determined as follows:



(1) _Number of Shares_. The number of shares of Zions Common Stock subject to
a New Option shall be equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of
Amegy Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Amegy Stock Option and
(II) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded down to the nearest whole
share; and



(2) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per share of Zions Common Stock
purchasable upon exercise of a New Option shall be equal to (I) the exercise
price per share of Amegy Common Stock under the Amegy Stock Option divided by
(II) the Exchange Ratio, the quotient being rounded up to the nearest cent.



With respect to any such Amegy Stock Options that are "incentive stock
options" (as defined in Section 422(b) of the Code) the foregoing adjustments
shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, Amegy,
or its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, will take all
action necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions of this Section
3.04(a) and shall take such other actions reasonably requested by Zions to
give effect to the foregoing.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Zions shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance a sufficient additional number of
shares of Zions Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction of its
obligations, if any, with respect to the New Options. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Zions shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the
Zions Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New Options and shall use
its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such New Options remain
outstanding.



(c) At the Effective Time, each phantom stock unit under the Amegy Non-
Employee Director Deferred Fee Plan (the " _Phantom Units_ ") shall be deemed
to be converted into the right to acquire the number of shares of Zions Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (x) the
number of shares of Amegy Common Stock subject to such Phantom Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Phantom Unit
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such units immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

17 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Amegy shall take all action necessary,
including any action reasonably requested by Zions, to cause each share of
Amegy restricted Common Stock under the Amegy Stock Plans which is outstanding
as of the Effective Time and which is unvested as of such time, (the
_"Unvested Restricted Stock"_ ) to be converted into the number of shares of
Zions Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number)
of (x) one and (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above,
following the Effective Time, each share of Unvested Restricted Stock shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.



3.05. _Dissenting Shareholders_.



(a) Each Dissenting Share shall _not_ be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Per Share Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Article 5.11 of the
BCA. Amegy shall give Zions prompt notice upon receipt by the Amegy of any
demand for payment pursuant to Articles 5.11 and 5.12 of the BCA and of
withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and Zions shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by
Zions.



(b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent under Article
5.11 of the BCA at or prior to the Effective Time, each of such holders
shares of Amegy Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive the
Per Share Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement.



3.06. _Effect on Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain
outstanding.

5.01. _Disclosure Schedules_. Before entry into this Agreement, Zions
delivered to Amegy a schedule and Amegy delivered to Zions a schedule
(respectively, each schedule a " _Disclosure Schedule_ "), setting forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in
a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Sections 5.03, or to one or more of its covenants
contained in Article IV; _provided_ that the inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty will not
by itself be deemed an admission by a party that such item is material or was
required to be disclosed therein.



5.02. _Standard_. For all purposes of this Agreement, no representation or
warranty of Amegy or Zions contained in Section 5.03 (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.03(b), 5.03(c) and
5.03(h)(3)(B), which shall be true in all respects except for de minimus
variations) will be deemed untrue, and no party will be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or
circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in
Section 5.03, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse

ARTICLE VI



COVENANTS



6.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Zions and Amegy will use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable
laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable
and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each will cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the other
party to that end.



(b) Zions will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by
or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time,
one or more supplemental indentures and other instruments required for the due
assumption of Amegys outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and (to the
extent informed of such requirement by Amegy) other agreements to the extent
required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities or other
agreements.



6.02. _Shareholder Approvals._ (a) The Amegy Board acted on this Agreement
and the plan of merger it contains and adopted resolutions recommending as of
the date hereof to Amegys shareholders approval of the plan of merger
contained in this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or
adopted in order to effect the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby.



 

33 (b) The Zions Board adopted this Agreement and the plan of merger it contains
and adopted resolutions approving and authorizing this Agreement and any
other matters required in order to effect the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

(c) The Amegy Board will submit to its shareholders the plan of merger
contained in this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or
adopted by shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this
Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Amegy will take, in accordance
with applicable law and its respective Constituent Documents, all reasonable
action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any
adjournment or postponement, the " _Amegy Meeting_ "), as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of the plan of
merger as well as any other such matters. The Amegy Board will use reasonable
best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving the plan of
merger contained in this Agreement, including a recommendation that its
respective shareholders vote in favor of the Merger. However, if the Amegy
Board, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel,
determines in good faith that the continued recommendation of the plan of
merger set forth in this Agreement would result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then in submitting the plan of
merger to the Amegy Meeting, the Amegy Board (1) may withdraw or modify its
recommendation (any such action constituting a " _Change in the Amegy
Recommendation_ ") and (2) shall at Zions request, nonetheless submit the
plan of merger to its shareholders without such recommendation in the manner
contemplated by Article 5.03(C) of the BCA.



(d) The Board of Directors of Amegy shall be permitted to effect a Change in
the Amegy Recommendation, only if and to the extent that all of the following
conditions are met: (i) the Amegy shareholder approval of the plan of merger
contained in this Agreement has not been obtained, (ii) before taking any such
action, Amegy promptly gives Zions (orally and in writing) notice advising
Zions of the decision of the Board of Directors of Amegy to take such action,
including the reasons therefor and, in the event that such decision relates to
an Acquisition Proposal, such notice specifies the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and identifies the person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and Amegy will also promptly give Zions such a notice
with respect to any subsequent change to such proposal) and Amegy has given
Zions at least three (3) business days after delivery of each such notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or to make another proposal)
in response to such Acquisition Proposal and has negotiated in good faith with
Zions with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any,
(iii) if such Change in the Amegy Recommendation relates to an Acquisition
Proposal received by Amegy or made directly to Amegys shareholders, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (iv) Amegy has
complied with its obligations set forth in Section 6.06.



6.03. _Filings._ (a) Zions and Amegy, as to each respectively, will cooperate
in ensuring that all filings required under SEC Rules 165, 425 and 14a-12 and
all other reports and other filings required to be filed with any other
applicable Governmental Authority are timely and properly made, comply in all
material respects with all applicable statutes, rules and
regulations enforced or promulgated by the Governmental



 

34  Authority with which it will be filed, and do not contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Zions will prepare a
registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by Zions with the SEC in connection
with the issuance of Zions Common Stock in the Merger. Amegy will prepare the
proxy statement and other proxy solicitation materials relating to the
approval of the plan of merger (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related
documents. Each party will cooperate, and will cause its Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with the other party, its counsel and its accountants, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement, and,
_provided_ that both parties and their respective Subsidiaries have cooperated
as required above, Zions agrees to file the Registration Statement with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Zions will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof and
to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until
the Effective Time. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide the other party with a
copy of all such filings with the SEC. Zions also agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated
hereby. Amegy agrees to furnish to Zions all information concerning Amegy, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing.



(b) Zions and Amegy each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if
any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Amegy Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Zions and Amegy each further agrees that if it becomes aware that
any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement.



(c) Zions will advise Amegy, promptly after Zions receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of Zions Common Stock for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, of the



 

35 initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request
by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or
for additional information.



6.04. _Press Releases_. Zions and Amegy will consult with each other before
issuing any press release, written employee communication or other written
shareholder communication with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
will not issue any such communication or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ that a party may, without the prior consent
of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in
the circumstances), issue such communication or make such public statement as
may be required by applicable law or securities exchange rules. Zions and
Amegy will cooperate to develop all public communications and make appropriate
members of management available at presentations related to the transactions
contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party.



6.05.  _Access; Information_. (a) Each of Zions and Amegy agrees that upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other
party, and the other partys officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized Representatives, such access during normal business hours
throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books, records
(including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent
auditors), properties, vendors, personnel and to such other information as the
other party may reasonably request and, during such period, it will furnish
promptly to the other party (1) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request.
Neither Zions nor Amegy will be required to afford access or disclose
information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege, contravene any
binding agreement with any third party, or violate any law or regulation. The
parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where
the previous sentence applies.



(b) Each party will hold any information which is nonpublic and confidential
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality
Agreement.



(c) No investigation by Zions or Amegy of the business and affairs of the
other party, pursuant to this Section 6.05 or otherwise, will affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, or the conditions to any partys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



6.06.  _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Amegy will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors, affiliates and any other person acting on their behalf not to,
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or waive any
provision of or



 

36 amend the terms of the Amegy Rights Agreement, in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_  that, in the event Amegy receives an unsolicited _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to
(but not after) the approval of this plan of merger by the shareholders of
Amegy at the Amegy Meeting, and the Amegy Board concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, Amegy may, and may
permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in
such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Amegy Board concludes
reasonably and in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure
to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party
on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that Amegy shall have given Zions (orally and in writing) at
least three (3) business days prior written notice of its intent to do so
before taking the first of any such actions with any one such person;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Amegy and the Board of Directors of Amegy shall
keep Zions informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
discussions or negotiations on a prompt basis, including by providing a copy
of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto; and
provided, further, that in any event Amegy shall be required to otherwise
comply with its obligations under Section 6.02(c). Amegy will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Zions
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Amegy will promptly advise Zions following receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof, and will keep Zions
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current basis.



(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Amegy or the Amegy Board
from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement.



6.07. _Affiliate Agreements_. Not later than the 15th day before the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, Amegy will deliver to Zions a schedule of each person
that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of
the date of the Amegy Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Amegy (each, an
" _Amegy Affiliate_ ") as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities
Act. Amegy will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who may
be deemed to be a Amegy Affiliate to execute and deliver to Zions and Amegy on
or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement an agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Annex 1.



6.08. _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. Neither party will take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those
transactions from, or if necessary



 

37 challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as
now or hereafter in effect. Neither party will take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated hereby not to comply with any Takeover
Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control
to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the
Takeover Provisions.



6.09. _Exchange Listing_. Zions will use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Zions Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly
as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.



6.10. _Regulatory Applications_. (a) Zions and Amegy and their respective
Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ ") as promptly as
practicable, and will make all necessary filings in respect of those Requisite
Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable. Each of Zions and Amegy will have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to all material written information
submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the foregoing right, each
of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
agrees that it will consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party will keep the other party
appraised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) Zions and Amegy will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.



6.11. _Indemnification_. (a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of Amegy and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities as
incurred, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), (1) to the same extent as
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
pursuant to the Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements, if any,
in effect on the date of this Agreement with Amegy and its Subsidiaries, and
(2) without limitation of clause (1), to the fullest extent permitted by law.



 

38 (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Zions will use all
reasonable best efforts to provide directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Amegy or any of their respective Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Effective Time) (as opposed to Amegy or such Subsidiary) with respect to
claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts,
and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party
as that coverage currently provided by Amegy; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Zions shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the premiums paid as of
the date hereof by Amegy for such insurance (" _Amegy s Current Premium_"),
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250%
of Amegys Current Premium, then Zions shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance which, in Zions good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of Amegys Current
Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of Amegy or
any Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to Zions insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such insurance.



(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Zions; _provided_ that failure so to
notify will not affect the obligations of Zions under Section 6.11(a) unless
and to the extent that Zions is actually and materially prejudiced as a
consequence.



(d) If Zions or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
any other entity, then and in each case, Zions will cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of Zions will assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.



(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.



6.12. _Employee Matters_. (a) During the 18 months after the Effective Time
(such date being referred to herein as the " _Benefits Transition Date_ "),
Zions shall provide the employees of Amegy and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") and whose employment continues
during such period with employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements (including base salary, annual bonus opportunities and annual
equity grants) no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by
Amegy or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to such employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Benefits Transition Date,
Zions shall provide the Covered Employees with employee benefits and
compensation 



 

39 plans, programs and arrangements and severance benefits that are substantially
identical to those provided to similarly situated employees of Zions and its
Subsidiaries. In addition, during the 24 months after the Effective Date, a
Covered Employee whose employment is terminated shall be entitled to receive
severance payments and benefits under the Amegy severance policy described in
Schedule 6.12(a).



(b) From and after the Benefits Transition Date, Zions shall (1) provide all
Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility (including
eligibility for retirement), participation, vesting, levels of benefits and
benefit accruals, under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Zions or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all
periods of employment with Amegy or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent credited by
Amegy for purposes of a comparable plan (provided that there will be no
duplication of benefits) and (2) cause any pre-existing conditions,
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any welfare benefit plans of Zions or any of its Subsidiaries to be
waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents,
to the extent waived under the corresponding plan (for a comparable level of
coverage) in which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If Amegys medical and/or dental benefit plans
for Covered Employees are terminated in the middle of a plan year, Covered
Employees and their dependents who are then participating in a deductible-
based medical and/or dental plan sponsored by Amegy will be given credit for
deductibles and eligible out-of-pocket expenses incurred towards deductibles
and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year preceding the
termination date in a comparable deductible-based medical and/or dental plan
of Zions or any of its Subsidiaries for the Zions benefit plan year that
begins with or includes the Benefits Transition Date.



(c) Zions and Amegy shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with
their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual
rights of, employees of Amegy and its Subsidiaries, including any benefits or
rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination with
any other event), which obligations, rights and benefits have been
Previously Disclosed.



(d) Zions agrees to expressly assume the agreements and plans set forth in
Schedule 6.12(d), except those agreements with individuals who are party to
the Employment Agreements. Zions and Amegy hereby agree that the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change
in control" for purposes of any Benefit Arrangement for Amegy.



(e) If the Effective Time occurs in 2005, Zions will (A) maintain a bonus plan
for the Covered Employees for the remainder of 2005 on the same terms and
conditions and pursuant to the same targets and performance measures as were
in effect under the Amegy bonus plan for the 2005 calendar year and (B) pay
bonuses to the Covered Employees within two and a half months following the
end of the 2005 calendar year in an amount equal to the annual bonus earned
by the participants for the 2005 calendar year under the bonus plan described
in clause (A) above (provided that if the Effective Time



 

40 occurs after November 1, 2005 but prior to 2006, then the Amegy Compensation
Committee may determine the 2005 annual bonus for the Covered Employees in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and such bonus
amounts will be paid by Zions within two and a half months following the end
of 2005; provided further, that such bonuses shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, 2.1 times the amount accrued with respect to such bonuses through
June 30, 2005 on Amegys financial statements, which accrued amount shall not
exceed $3.7 million). If the Effective Time occurs in 2006, Amegy shall be
permitted prior to the Effective Time to pay 2005 annual bonuses based upon
2005 performance in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and to establish a bonus plan for 2006, based upon targets and
goals substantially similar to those established for 2005. In addition, in
the event the Effective Time occurs in 2006, the Covered Employees will be
paid bonus for 2006 in the same manner as bonuses for 2005 would have been
calculated as described above had the Effective Time occurred in 2005.
Amegys performance in respect of calculations made under the bonus plans for
the calendar years 2005 and 2006 shall be calculated without taking into
account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that
would not reasonably expected to have been incurred had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, and shall not be subject
to reduction or negative discretion by the administrator of the bonus plan.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.12,
Zions shall have no obligations to provide Covered Employees with benefits
under or similar to the value sharing plans of Zions and certain of its
Subsidiaries. Zions and Amegy agree that the benefits provided under the
Employment Agreements satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (e) of
this Section 6.12.



6.13. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Zions and Amegy will give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII. 



6.14. _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Assuming that Amegy
delivers to Zions the Section 16 Information in a timely and accurate manner,
before the Effective Time, the Zions Board, or a committee of "non-employee
directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), will reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event
before the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the
Amegy Insiders of Zions Common Stock in exchange for shares of Amegy Common
Stock, and of options to purchase shares of Zions Common Stock upon conversion
of options to purchase shares of Amegy Common Stock, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities
are listed in the Section 16 Information, are approved by the Zions Board or
by such committee thereof, and are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, such that any such receipt
will be so exempt. 



 

41 6.15. _Certain Modifications; Restructuring._ Amegy shall consult and
cooperate with Zions with respect to Amegys loan, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) and interest rate risk management and, subject to applicable law,
Amegy shall make such modifications or changes to its policies and practices,
if any, and shall take such actions with respect to interest rate risk
management, at such date prior to the Effective Time, in each case as may be
mutually agreed upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Amegy and Zions shall also consult with respect to the character,
amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take such
charges in accordance with GAAP, as may be mutually agreed upon. No partys
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a
consequence of any modifications or changes to such policies and practices
which may be undertaken on account of this Section 6.15.

termination, if there has occurred and is continuing: (1) a breach by the
other party of any representation or warranty contained herein, or (2) a
breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements in

such notice specifies the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and identifies the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and
Amegy will also promptly give Zions such a notice with respect to any
subsequent



 

44 change to such proposal) and Amegy has given Zions at least three (3) business

(e)  _Denial of Regulatory Approval, etc._ By Zions or Amegy, if (i) there

jurisdiction, and such judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become
final and non-appealable, or (ii) the approval of any Governmental Authority
required for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby is denied by final, nonappealable action of such
Governmental Authority; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement

the required vote at such meeting.



8.02. _Termination by Zions_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
Merger may be abandoned, at any time before the Effective Time, by Zions, upon
written notice to Amegy, if Amegy shall have breached its obligations under
Sections 6.02 or 6.06.



8.03. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._ If this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger is abandoned, neither party will have any liability

Section 8.03, Section 8.04 and Article IX will survive termination of this
Agreement.



8.04. _Amegy Termination Fee._ (a) " _Termination Fee_ " means $60.0 million.



(b) If:



(i) Zions shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.01(c)(A)
(unless Amegy has been requested by Zions to submit this Agreement to the
shareholders of Amegy notwithstanding the Change in the Amegy Recommendation)
or 8.02; or



 

45 (ii) Amegy shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(B); or

 



(iii) either Amegy or Zions shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f) (irrespective of whether Amegy has been requested by Zions to
submit this Agreement to the shareholders of Amegy notwithstanding the Change
in the Amegy Recommendation) and prior to the Amegy Meeting but after the
date hereof an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to Amegy
(including any of its agents or representatives) and communicated publicly or
to any substantial number of shareholders of Amegy or shall have been made
directly to the shareholders of Amegy by any person or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal; or



 

(iv) after the date hereof, an Acquisition Proposal by any person shall have
been made known to Amegy (including any of its agents or representatives) and
communicated publicly or to any substantial number of shareholders of Amegy or
shall have been made directly to the shareholders of Amegy by any person, or
any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Amegy or Zions pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or by
Zions pursuant to 8.01(b) and the Amegy shareholder approval of this plan of
merger shall not theretofore have been obtained;



then in any case as described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) Amegy shall
pay to Zions (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) (x) one-third
of the Termination Fee not later than the second business day following the
date of termination of this Agreement and (y) an additional two-thirds of the
Termination Fee if and not later than the date an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated by Amegy (other than the Merger), as long as such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, or a definitive agreement providing for such
Acquisition Proposal is entered into by Amegy, within 12 months after the date
of termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
purpose of this clause (y), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "15%" shall instead refer to "a majority." Amegy
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.04 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Zions would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Amegy fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.04 and, in order to obtain such payment, Zions commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Amegy for the amount payable to Zions
pursuant to this Section 8.04, Amegy shall pay to Zions its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount so payable at the rate on six (6)-month
United States Treasury obligations (as of the date such payment was required
to be made pursuant to this Agreement) plus three percent (3%).

50 ANNEX 1



FORM OF AMEGY AFFILIATE LETTER



[*], 2005



Amegy Bancorporation, Inc.

4400 Post Oak Parkway

Houston, TX 77027



Zions Bancorporation

One South Main, Suite 1134

Salt Lake City, UT 84111



Independence Merger Company, Inc.

One South Main, Suite 1134

Salt Lake City, UT 84111



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Amegy
Bancorporation, Inc. (" _Amegy_ "), as that term is defined for purposes of
Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). I
understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of July 5, 2005 (as amended or modified from time to time, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Amegy, Zions Bancorporation (" _Zions_ "),
and Independence Merger Company, Inc. ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), Amegy plans to merge
with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") with Merger Sub the surviving
corporation. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.



I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I may receive
common stock of Zions (the " _Zions Common Stock_ ") in exchange for shares
of common stock of Amegy (the " _Amegy Common Stock_ "), or as a result of the
exercise of Amegy Stock Options or similar Rights.



I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Merger Agreement
and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my
ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Zions Common Stock and
Amegy Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel
for Amegy.



I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Zions that in the event
I receive any Zions Common Stock as a result of the Merger:



1\. I will not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such Zions
Common Stock unless (a) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Securities Act, (b) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of  



 

Annex 1, page 1 Rule 145 under the Securities Act, or (c) in the opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Zions, or under a "no-action" letter
obtained by me from the staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other
disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under
the Securities Act.



2\. I understand that, except as provided in Section 3.04 of the
Merger Agreement, Zions is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer
or other disposition of shares of Zions Common Stock by me or on my behalf
under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to
make compliance with an exemption from such registration available, except
the obligation to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as more fully described below.



3\. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Zions transfer agent with respect to the shares of Zions Common Stock issued
to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the
certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating
in substance:



"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the
terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and
Zions Bancorporation, a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal
offices of Zions Bancorporation."



4\. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Zions Common Stock issued
to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities
Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d)
under the Securities Act, Zions reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933
applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."



I understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraph 3 or 4 above,
as the case may be, will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend if I deliver to Zions (a) a copy of a "no-action" letter
from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Zions, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (b) evidence or
representations reasonably satisfactory to Zions that Zions Common
Stock represented by such certificates is being or has been sold in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d).



By its acceptance hereof, Zions agrees, for a period of two years after the
Effective Time, that it, as the Surviving Corporation, will file on a
timely basis all reports required to be filed by  



 

Annex 1, page 2 it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) promulgated
under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rule
145(d)(1) and (2) promulgated under the Securities Act are therefore available
to me in the event I desire to transfer any Zions Common Stock issued to me
in the Merger.



By signing this letter agreement, without limiting or abrogating the
agreements that I have made as set forth above, I do not admit that I am an
"affiliate" of Amegy within the meaning of the Securities Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and I do not waive any right that I may
have to object to any assertion that I am an affiliate.



This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York. This letter agreement shall terminate
if and when the Merger Agreement is terminated according to its terms.



     
--- 
  Very truly yours,
