   | 14.1.2| the Damages, Taxes or Environmental Damages were recorded as
a liability, accrual ( _R uckstellung_), depreciation ( _Abschreibung_ ) or
write-down ( _Wertberichtigung_ ) in any of the ARAPP 2014 Financials; or 
---|---|--- 
   | 14.1.3| the Damages, Taxes or Environmental Damages are recoverable
with reasonable efforts by a third party (including in particular an
insurance company). 
---|---|--- 
   | 14.2| _Third Party Claims_. In the event that any third party
asserts, pursues or notifies any action, claim or proceeding which may lead
to the Purchaser seeking to recover from the Sellers under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, regarding Taxes), the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Sellers\' Representative thereof. The Purchaser shall
give the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
any action, claim or proceeding. The Purchaser shall be obliged to cooperate
with the Sellers in such defense, in particular, at the Sellers\' request
make available to the Sellers and its advisors all relevant books, records
and other information available to the Purchaser, to the extent required or
appropriate in connection with the defense. The Purchaser shall not admit,
settle, pay, discharge any such assessment or claim against it or any
ARAPP Company without the prior written consent of the Sellers, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld - particularly if Tax payments are to be made
-, in which case all claims of the Purchaser against the Sellers shall be
deemed forfeited.

jointly and severally.

---|---|--- 
   | 14.4.2| the aggregate amount of all Damages or Environmental Damages
above the De Minimis Amount exceed EUR 1,000,000.00 (the " _Threshold Amount_
"); in case the Threshold Amount is exceeded, Purchaser shall be entitled to
recovery of the amount of all Damages or Environmental Damages in excess of
the Threshold Amount. 
---|---|--- 
    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

For the avoidance of doubt it is agreed that the De Minimis Amount shall not
apply to Taxes and claims which result from a breach of any obligation under
Section 8.1 (leakage under the locked box procedure under Section 8).

   | 14.5| _Maximum Amount of Liability_. The total liability of each
Seller for Damages, Taxes or Environmental Damages shall not exceed EUR
10,000,000.00 (the " _Cap_ "), except that the Cap shall not apply to any
acts of fraud or willful misconduct. 
---|---|--- 
   | 14.6| _Exclusion of Other Remedies_. The Parties are in agreement
that the remedies provided in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies
available to Purchaser against the Sellers and supersede any statutory
warranties ( _kaufrechtliche Gew ahrleistungen_) which may exist in parallel
with regard to the subject-matter of this Agreement. In connection with this
Agreement, in particular, without limitation, any claims against Sellers
based on statutory warranties and/or other warranty rights including but not
limited to (i) any right of Purchaser to rescind ( _zur ucktreten_) from this
Agreement or to require the unwinding of the Transaction contemplated therein
(e.g. by way of _gro ßer Schadenersatz _or _Schadenersatz statt der Leistung_
); (ii) any claim for reduction of purchase price ( _Minderung_ ); (iii) any
claim for breach of pre-contractual obligations ( _culpa in contrahendo,_

contract pursuant to Section 313 BGB ( _St orung der Geschaftsgrundlage_), (v)
violation of ancillary duty of care ( _positive Vertragsverletzung_ ) or (vi)
tort ( _Delikt_ ) shall be excluded, save for any remedies of Purchaser in
the event of willful deceit ( _arglistige T auschung_) or intentional breach
of contract ( _vors atzliche Vertragsverletzung_).
