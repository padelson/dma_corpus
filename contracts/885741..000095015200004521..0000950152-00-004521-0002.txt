-iii-  5      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
----------------------------   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(hereinafter called this "Agreement"), dated as of May 29, 2000 among
Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
Gliatech Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and St. John Development
Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Subsidiary").   RECITALS 
--------   WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of
Parent, the Company, and the Merger Subsidiary, have adopted this Agreement
and determined that the merger of the Merger Subsidiary with and into the
Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement is advisable and have approved the Merger;   WHEREAS, in
order to induce Parent and Merger Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently herewith certain officers and each of the directors of the
Company are entering into stockholder agreements with Parent (the
"Stockholder Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, each such
person agrees to vote as a stockholder in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger and against any competing proposals;   WHEREAS, it is intended that,
for federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Code");   WHEREAS, for financial accounting purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests;" and  
WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
the parties hereto agree as follows:   6    ARTICLE I  THE MERGER  
1.1. THE MERGER.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) the
Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of the Merger Subsidiary shall thereupon cease. The
Company shall be the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Company"), and the separate legal existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the
"DGCL").   1.2. CLOSING.   The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place (i) at the offices of Hogan and Hartson LLP, 111 South Calvert
Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 at 9:00 A.M. not later than the second
business day after the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on
such other date as the Company and Parent may agree (the "Closing Date").  
1.3. EFFECTIVE TIME.   As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company, Merger Subsidiary and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
and accepted for record by the Delaware Secretary of State (the "Secretary")
as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
the time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary or at such
later time agreed by the Company and Parent and established under the
Certificate of Merger, not to exceed 30 days after the Certificate of Merger
is filed with the Secretary (the "Effective Time").     -2-  7   
ARTICLE II  THE SURVIVING COMPANY   2.1. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.  
The certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the certificate of incorporation (the "Certificate of
Incorporation") of the Surviving Company, provided that immediately after
the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to read
in its entirety like the certificate of incorporation of the Merger
Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
Article 1. of such certificate of incorporation shall be amended in its
entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Gliatech Inc.
(the "Corporation")."   2.2. BY-LAWS.   The by-laws of Merger Subsidiary
in effect at the Effective Time, shall be adopted as the by-laws of the
Surviving Company (the "By-Laws"), until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.   2.3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS.   The Board of
Directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the Board of Directors of the Surviving Company until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws.   ARTICLE III  CONVERSION OF
SHARES   3.1. EFFECT ON STOCK.   At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any stock of the
Company:   (a) MERGER CONSIDERATION. Each share of Common Stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") (each a "Share"
or, collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(b) hereof) shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for the right
to receive consideration (the "Merger Consideration"), consisting of 1.38
shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") (including any related Rights issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement (the "Parent Rights Agreement") dated
September 26,     -3-  8   1995, as amended, between Parent and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company).   At the Effective Time, all
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly
representing any of such Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to SECTION 3.2(e), if any, and any distribution or dividend pursuant to
SECTION 3.2(c).   (b) CANCELLATION OF SHARES. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by Parent or
owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (in
each case other than Shares that are owned on behalf of third parties),
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor.   (c) MERGER SUBSIDIARY. At
the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Company.   3.2. EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Not later than the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American
Stock Transfer and Trust Co. or another entity selected by Parent prior to the
Effective Time with the Company\'s approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and, after the
Effective Time, if applicable, any cash, dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to SECTION
3.2(c) or SECTION 3.2(e) in exchange for Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III (such
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with the amount of
any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto and any
cash in lieu of fractional Shares, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Shares (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, and     -4-  9   (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (a) certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and (b) any unpaid dividends and
other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Subject to SECTION
3.2(h), upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE III, (y) a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of
any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this ARTICLE III, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid
upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Person (as defined below) requesting such exchange shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean
any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate,
trust, association, organization, governmental entity or other entity of any
kind or nature.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES;
VOTING.   (i) All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in
respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common
Stock shall be    -5-  10   paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this ARTICLE III. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and/or paid to the
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to such time of surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid
and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
surrender.   (ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates who were the
registered holders at the Effective Time shall be entitled to vote after
the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificates, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.   (d) TRANSFERS.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will
be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock but for this SECTION 3.2(e) shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall equal the amount
determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the average closing
price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") for the twenty most recent days that Parent Common Stock
has traded ending on the third trading day prior to the Effective Time. The
fractional share interests of each holder of Company Common Stock shall be
aggregated, so that no such holder shall receive cash in an amount equal to
or greater than the value of one share of Parent Common Stock.   (f)
TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Common Stock) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be paid to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash,
dividends and other distributions in     -6-  11   respect thereof
payable and/or issuable pursuant to SECTION 3.1, SECTION 3.2(c) AND SECTION
3.2(e) upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (g) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED
CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash
payable and any unpaid dividends or other distributions in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 3.2(c) upon due surrender of and deliverable in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.  
(h) AFFILIATES. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Certificates
surrendered for exchange by any "Affiliate" (as determined pursuant to
SECTION 6.10) of the Company shall not be exchanged until Parent has received
a written agreement from such Person as provided in SECTION 6.10 hereof.  
3.3. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.   In accordance with Section 262(b) of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in connection with
the Merger.   3.4. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION.   In the event that
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time the Company changes the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.    -7-  12    
ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set
forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the Company disclosure
schedule delivered to Parent in connection with the execution of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:   4.1. ORGANIZATION, GOOD
STANDING AND QUALIFICATION.   The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all other
such failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in SECTION 9.12(b)). The Company has made available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company\'s and each Subsidiaries\'
charter and by-laws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended
to and as in effect as of the date hereof. The Company does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in,
any Person other than its Subsidiaries.   4.2. CAPITALIZATION.   The
authorized stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000 Shares, of which
9,511,087 Shares were outstanding as of the close of business on May 26,
2000, and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value .01 per share (the
"Preferred Shares"), of which no shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on the date hereof. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company
has no commitments to issue or deliver Shares or Preferred Shares, except
that, as of the date hereof, there were 2,128,250 Shares subject to issuance
pursuant to the Company\'s Amended and Restated 1989 Stock Option Plan, 1992
Directors Stock Option Plan, 1995 Amended and Restated Nonemployee
Director Stock Option Plan and Director\'s Equity Plan (collectively the
"Company Stock Plans"), 18,000 Shares subject to issuance pursuant to stock
options granted outside of the Company Stock Plans, and     -8- 
13   300,000 Preferred Shares subject to issuance pursuant to the Company
Rights Agreement. SECTION 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
list, which is complete and accurate in all respects as of the date hereof,
of each outstanding option to purchase or acquire Shares under each of the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise (each a "Company Option"), including the
plan, if applicable, the holder, date of grant, exercise price, vesting
provisions and number of Shares subject thereto. The Company has no
outstanding Deferred Stock Awards or options, or commitments to issue the
same under the Company\'s Director Equity Plan. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, free and clear of any lien,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. The Company has no
warrants outstanding for purchase of its common stock and, except as
described in this SECTION 4.2 or in SECTION 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or,
except as referred to in this Section 4.2, convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company
on any matter.   4.3. CORPORATE AUTHORITY; APPROVAL AND FAIRNESS.   (a)
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, subject only to approval of the Merger by
the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Shares (the "Company
Requisite Vote"), to consummate the Merger. This Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws and equitable principles now or
hereafter in effect and affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally.   (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting
duly called and held, by unanimous vote of all members present and
constituting a quorum (i) has approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and    -9-  14   the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) has resolved to submit the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and recommend approval thereof
by, the stockholders of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company
has received the opinion of its financial advisor SG Cowen Securities
Corporation, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger
Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to holders of
Shares.   4.4. GOVERNMENTAL FILINGS; NO VIOLATIONS.   (a) Other than the
filings and/or notices pursuant to or required by (i) SECTION 1.3 hereof,
(ii) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(the "HSR Act") and Applicable Foreign Competition Laws, (iii) the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (iv) the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (v) state securities or

Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not
require any filings, notices, consents or approvals with or by any Court,
administrative agency, commission, government or regulatory authority,
domestic or foreign, except those that the failure to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Subject to compliance with the filings described
in SECTION 4.4(a) and obtaining Private Consents (as defined below)
applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation by
the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will
not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default
under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the
comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, or the acceleration of any obligations or
the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease, contract, note,
mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation ("Contracts") binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) any change in the rights
or obligations of any party under any of those Contracts, (iv) any conflict
with or violation of any Laws (as defined in SECTION 4.9) that would impair
the Company\'s or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries\' business or their
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
adversely affect any licenses or     -10-  15   approvals necessary to
enable the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry on their business as
presently conducted, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv), for
any conflict, breach, violation, default, acceleration,
declaration, imposition or impairment that would not be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. SCHEDULE 4.4(b) to this Agreement sets forth
a list of Contracts (by category and type, where applicable) material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to which consents or
waivers ("Private Consents") are required prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to the
exception set forth with respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above).  
4.5. COMPANY REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent each registration statement, report, proxy statement
or information statement prepared by it since December 31, 1999 (the "Company
Audit Date"), including (a) the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1999 (b) the Company\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2000 and (c) the Company\'s
definitive Proxy Statement for its 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each
in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (collectively,
including any such reports filed subsequent to the date hereof, the "Company
Reports"). As of their respective dates the Company Reports complied, and any
Company reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will comply,
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC. As of their respective dates, the Company Reports did not, and any
Company Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in
or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income and of changes in financial position included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited    
-11-  16   statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in
each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.   4.6. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES.   Except as disclosed in
the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth on SECTION
4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since the Company Audit Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to,
the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not been: (a)
any Company Material Adverse Effect or other event, or any other development
or combination of developments of which the Responsible Executive Officers of
the Company have knowledge, that, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b) any
material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any
material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; (c) any
authorization, declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in respect of the stock of the Company, except as permitted by
SECTION 6.1 hereof; (d) any change by the Company in accounting principles,
practices or methods other than as required by changes in applicable GAAP; or
(e) any repurchase or redemption of any Shares. Since the Company Audit Date,
except as provided for herein or as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth on SECTION 4.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there has not been any increase in the
compensation payable or that could become payable by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to officers at the vice president level or above or any
amendment of any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans (as defined in
SECTION 4.8(a)). The maximum financial liability to which the Company would
be subject in the event of the early termination of any lease for property
described in SECTION 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule would not exceed
an amount disclosed in SECTION 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.  
4.7. LITIGATION AND LIABILITIES.   Except as disclosed in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth on SECTION 4.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no (a) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations, proceedings,
judgments, decrees, orders or injunctions outstanding, pending or, to the
knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) obligations or
liabilities of any nature, whether or not     -12-  17  accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any
other facts or circumstances of which the Responsible Executive Officers have
knowledge, that have resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in
any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries, except, in each case, for such actions, suits,
claims, hearings, investigations, proceedings, obligations and liabilities
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   4.8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) A copy of each bonus, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee
stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
employment, termination, severance, change of control, compensation, medical,
health or other plan, agreement, policy or arrangement that covers, or, in
the past three years, has covered employees, directors, former employees or
former directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans") and any trust agreement or insurance
contract forming a part of such Company Compensation and Benefit Plans has
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. For the three most
recent plan years, all annual reports (Form 5500 series) on each Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan that have been filed with any governmental
agency and the current summary plan description and subsequent summaries of
material modifications for each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. The Compensation and
Benefit Plans are listed on SECTION 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and any "change of control" or similar provisions therein are specifically
identified on SECTION 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (b) All
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable laws, including, to the extent applicable, the
Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"). Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and the
Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation
of any such favorable determination letter. There is no pending or, to
the knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company,
threatened litigation relating to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan    -13- 
18    that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of
the date hereof, would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a
material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.   (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently has and at no time in the past has had an obligation to contribute
to a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension
plan subject to the funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
Section 414(f) of the Code or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning
of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code.   (d) All
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made or have been
reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated
by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof, except where
the failure to make such contributions, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) Except as disclosed in SECTION 4.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan, other than as mandated by the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Section 162(k) of the Code, as applicable, and
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. The Company or its Subsidiaries may
amend or terminate any such plan under the terms of such plan at any time
without incurring any material liability thereunder.   (f) Except as
disclosed in SECTION 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Merger will
not (i) entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans.   (g) All Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans covering current or former non-U.S. employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with
applicable local law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material
unfunded liabilities with respect to any Pension Plan that covers such
non-U.S. employees.     -14-  19    (h) The number of individuals who
perform services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on a full-time
basis but who are not employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
does not exceed 5% of the workforce of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  
(i) Except as set forth in SECTION 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the
Company who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code).   4.9. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS.   Except as set forth in
the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof or on SECTION 4.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the businesses of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement,
license or permit of any governmental entity ("Laws"), except for violations
or possible violations that, individually or in the aggregate, do not or
would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in the
Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof or on SECTION 4.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no investigation or review by any governmental
entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company,
threatened, nor has any governmental entity overtly indicated to the Company
an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries
each has all permits, licenses, trademarks, patents, trade names, copyrights,
service marks, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and
other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted except those the absence of which
do not, or would not be reasonably likely to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.     -15-  20    4.10.
TAKEOVER STATUTES.   The Board of Directors of the Company has taken all
necessary action so that no restrictive provision of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation, including, but not limited to, ss. 203 of the DGCL, (each a
"Takeover Statute") or restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the charter or by-laws of the Company, is, or at the Effective
Time will be, applicable to the Company, the Shares, the Merger or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements.

bodies necessary to the conduct of the businesses of the Company and its

Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title to all of their material

encumbrances which secure indebtedness reflected in the financial statements
included in the Company Reports.   4.16. MATERIAL CONTRACTS.   All of the
Material Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to

liability, business interruption, product liability, clinical trail liability
and other insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
All such policies are in full force and effect in all material respects and
no event has occurred that would give any insurance carrier a right to
terminate any such policy. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been denied or had any policy of insurance revoked or rescinded. To the
knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company, all such
policies are adequate to insure against risks to which the Company and its
properties are exposed in such amounts and subject to such terms as are
commercially reasonable for the business in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are engaged.   4.19. INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.   Except
as set forth in the Company Reports or on SECTION 4.19 of the Company

Person, the Distribution Date (each as defined in the Company Rights

the Shares, as a result of Parent or Merger Subsidiary entering    -22- 
27   into this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements or consummating the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   4.21.
ACCOUNTING, TAX AND SEC MATTERS.   (a) As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor
do the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company have any knowledge of
any fact or circumstance, that would prevent Parent or the Company from
accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a
"pooling-of-interests" or prevent the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) The Company has provided
to the Company\'s and Parent\'s independent accountants all information
concerning actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or any of its
Affiliates on or before the date of this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to affect the ability of Parent to account for the business
combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests.   (c)
To the knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers of the Company, except
for routine matters relating to the review of Company Reports by the SEC
Division of Corporation Finance, the Company has not and is not the subject
of any formal or informal inquiry or investigation by the SEC. The Company

ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF  PARENT AND MERGER
SUBSIDIARY   Except as set forth in the corresponding sections
or subsections of the Parent Disclosure Schedule delivered to the Company

of Merger Subsidiary, (ii) no securities of Merger Subsidiary convertible
into or exchangeable for Merger Subsidiary Stock or other voting securities
of Merger Subsidiary and (iii) no options or other rights to acquire from

ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION.   Parent is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all other
such failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy
of Parent\'s charter and by-laws, each as amended to and as in effect as of
the date hereof.   5.3. CAPITALIZATION.   The authorized stock of Parent
consists of 75 million shares of Parent Common Stock, of which 23,437,176
shares were outstanding as of the close of business on May 24, 2000, and 5
million shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Parent
Preferred Shares" and together with Parent Common Stock, the "Parent
Shares"), of which no shares were outstanding as of the close of business on
the date hereof. All of the outstanding Parent Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and     -24- 
29   nonassessable. Parent has no commitments to issue or deliver Parent
Shares, except that, as of May 24, 2000, there were 3,688,380 shares of

securities of each of Parent\'s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any lien,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. Except as described in
this SECTION 5.3, the Parent Reports or in SECTION 5.3 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption

or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or, except as
referred to in this SECTION 5.3, convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any
matter.   5.4. AUTHORITY; APPROVAL AND FAIRNESS.   (a) Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and, with respect to Parent, subject
only to approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock by the holders of at
least a majority of the total votes cast on the proposal in person or by
proxy (the "Parent Requisite Vote"), to consummate the Merger. This Agreement
is a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, as
the case may be, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited or
affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws and equitable principles now or
hereafter in effect and affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally.    -25-  30    (b) The Board of Directors of Parent, at a
meeting duly called and held, by unanimous vote (i) has approved this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (ii) has resolved to submit the proposed issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger to, and recommend approval thereof by, the
stockholders of the Company. The Board of Directors of Parent has received

or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary to consummate transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Subject to compliance with the filings described
in SECTION 5.5(a) and obtaining Private Consents applicable to the Parent and
its Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Parent and the Merger Subsidiary does not, and the consummation by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or of
Merger Subsidiary, or the comparable governing instruments of any of
Parent\'s other Subsidiaries, (ii) a breach or violation of, or a default
under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien, pledge,
security interest or other encumbrance on the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any
Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) any change in
the rights or obligations of any party under any of those Contracts, (iv) any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or adversely    -26- 
31   affect any licenses or approvals necessary to enable Parent and its
Subsidiaries to carry on their business as presently conducted, except, in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv), for any conflict, breach, violation,
default, acceleration, declaration, imposition or impairment that would not
be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in each case, for such

be as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
performance of its obligations hereunder or as contemplated hereby, in

or agreed to take any action, nor do the Responsible Executive Officers of
Parent have any knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that would prevent
Parent or the Company from accounting for the business combination to be
effected by the Merger as a "pooling-of-interests" or prevent the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b)
Parent has provided to the Company and Parent\'s independent accountants all
information concerning actions taken or agreed to be taken by Parent or any
of its Affiliates on or before the date of this      -33-

Adverse Effect.   5.16. TITLE TO PROPERTY.   Except as set forth in the
Parent Reports or on SECTION 5.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title to all of their
material properties and assets, free and clear of all encumbrances, except
liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such encumbrances or other
imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value
of or interfere with the present use of the property affected thereby or
which would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and except for encumbrances which secure indebtedness reflected in
the financial statements included in the Parent Reports.   5.17. MATERIAL
CONTRACTS.   All of the Material Contracts of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that are required to be described in the Parent Reports or to be

defaults as individually or in aggregate have not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement containing

similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, or any purchase of 10% or more of their respective assets or equity
securities (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"). The Company will not, and will not permit or cause
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, induce or
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries with respect to or the
making of any Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, whether made before or after the date of this Agreement, or
otherwise intentionally facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, by means of an
amendment to the Company Rights Agreement); provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rules 14d-      - 38 -  43  9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or
at any time prior to the time the Merger has been approved by the Company
Requisite Vote from: (a) providing information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has delivered to the Board of Directors of
the Company an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Board of Directors of Company receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement the terms of which are
(without regard to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal) (i) no less
favorable to the Company and (ii) no less restrictive on the Person
requesting such information than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in SECTION 9.7); or (b) engaging in negotiations or
discussions with a Person who has delivered to the Board of Directors of the
Company an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; if, and only
to the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (a) or (b) above,
(x) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (based on
the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is likely to be consummated and (y)
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (based on
advice of its financial adviser) that the Acquisition Proposal would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders (with respect to financial terms and, if applicable, strategic
benefit, taking into account the long-term value to stockholders of the
Merger Consideration and the strategic nature of the proposed Merger) than
the Merger (any Acquisition Proposal as to which such determinations are made
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company
will as promptly as reasonably possible notify the Parent if after the date
hereof any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or its representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall
keep the Parent informed, on a current basis, on the status and terms of any
such proposals or offers and the status of any such negotiations or
discussions. Nothing in this SECTION 6.4 shall permit the Company to enter
into any agreement, orally or in writing, with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement as described above). The Company shall immediately cease and shall
instruct its representatives to immediately cease all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any other parties with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal.   6.5. INFORMATION SUPPLIED.   Each of the
Company and Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its      - 39 - 
44  Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in
connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the joint proxy statement and prospectus (the "Prospectus/Proxy
Statement") constituting a part thereof) (the "S-4 Registration Statement")
will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, not misleading, and (b) the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders of
the Company and Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   6.6. STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS.   Whether or not the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take any action permitted by the third
sentence of this SECTION 6.6, the Company shall cause a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") to be duly called and held
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall (i) include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement (the "Company
Board Recommendation") and the written opinion of SG Cowen Securities
Corporation, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the
date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the necessary vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement by its stockholders. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Board Recommendation (or announce publicly its intention to do so),
except that, prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to withdraw, amend, modify or
materially qualify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation (or publicly announce its intention to do so), following three
business days\' prior notice to Parent, but only if (A) the Company has
complied in all respects with this Agreement, including SECTION 6.4, and (B)
after receiving advice of its outside legal counsel, the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith that the Merger is not in the best
interests of the stockholders of the Company and that, therefore, it
is required to withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation in
order to satisfy its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law.      - 40 -  45  Parent shall cause a meeting
of its stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting"), to be to be called
and held as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, for the
purpose of voting upon the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger, and Parent\'s Board of Directors will recommend such approval by
its stockholders and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the necessary vote in favor of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
Merger (provided that Parent\'s Board of Directors may withdraw, amend or
modify its recommendation if, after receiving advice of its outside legal
counsel, the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith that the
Merger is not in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and
that, therefore, it is required to withdraw, amend or modify
its recommendation in order to satisfy its fiduciary duties to stockholders
under applicable law).   6.7. FILINGS; OTHER ACTIONS; NOTIFICATION.   (a)
Parent shall (with the cooperation of the Company) prepare and file with the
SEC the S-4 Registration Statement as promptly as practicable. Parent and the
Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter mail
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the respective stockholders of each of the
Company and Parent.   (b) The Company and Parent each shall from the date
hereof until the Effective Time cooperate with the other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any governmental entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing in this SECTION 6.7 shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval,
to proffer to, or agree to (i) sell or hold separate and agree to sell or to
discontinue or limit, before or after the Effective Time, any assets,
businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement
to sell, or discontinuance or limitation by the Company of any of its assets
or businesses) or (ii) agree to any conditions relating to, or changes or
restrictions in, the operations of any such assets or      - 41 - 
46  businesses which, in either case would be reasonably expected to
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Parent
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.   (c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, executive officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Prospectus/ Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
governmental entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.8. TAXATION AND ACCOUNTING.   Neither
Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries or, to the extent within their control, Affiliates to, take or
cause to be taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time,
that would disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for accounting
purposes or as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to cure any impediment to the qualification of the Merger as
a "pooling of interests" for accounting purposes or as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   6.9. ACCESS.   Upon
reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable law,
each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford the other party\'s officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives ("Representatives") access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties,
books, contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as may       - 42 - 
47  reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this
Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Parent or Company, and provided, further, that the foregoing
shall not require the Parent or Company to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that (i) in the reasonable judgment of the Parent
or Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Parent or Company shall have used all reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) would
violate any attorney-client privilege of the Parent or Company. All requests
for information made pursuant to this SECTION 6.9 shall be directed to such
Person as may be designated by the Parent or Company pursuant to SECTION 9.6
hereof. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter defined).   6.10. AFFILIATES.  
(a) Attached hereto as EXHIBIT A-1 is a list of names and addresses of those
Persons who are, in the opinion of the Company (after consultation
with outside legal counsel), "Affiliates" of the Company within the meaning
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and for the purposes of applicable
interpretations regarding the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. The
Company has delivered or shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, at
least 45 days prior to the Effective Time, from each affiliate of the Company
identified in the foregoing list, and any other person who Parent or the
Company reasonably believes is an Affiliate of the Company, a letter in the
form attached as EXHIBIT A-2 (the "Company Affiliates Letter"). The
certificates representing Parent Common Stock received by such Affiliates
shall bear a customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act
restrictions and restrictions relating to pooling of interests applicable to
Company Affiliates.   (b) In order to preserve pooling-of-interests
accounting treatment for the Merger, the Company shall be entitled, with
regard to Shares held by a Person deemed by the Company to be an "Affiliate"
of the Company (within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and
for purposes of applicable interpretations regarding the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting, and regardless of whether or not such person is listed
on EXHIBIT A-1), and Parent shall be entitled, with regard to shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to a
person deemed by parent to be an Affiliate of the Company (under the
definition given above), to place appropriate legends on the certificates for
such Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, and to
issue appropriate stock transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the
Shares or the Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, and shall be entitled
to impose restrictions      - 43 -  48  on any such Shares or shares
of Parent Common Stock, to the effect that such Shares or shares of Parent
Common Stock may only be sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed, and the
holder thereof may only reduce his interest in or risks relating to such
Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock, pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or in accordance with the
provisions Rule 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act or pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act and, in any event,
only after financial results covering at least 30 days of combined operations
of the Company and Parent after the Effective Time shall have been published.
The foregoing restrictions relating to the transferability of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to any deemed Affiliate pursuant to this
Agreement shall apply to all purported sales, transfers and other conveyances
of such shares of Parent Common Stock and to all purported reductions in the
interest in or risks relating to such shares of Parent Common Stock, whether
or not such deemed Affiliate has exchanged the certificates previously
evidencing such deemed Affiliate\'s Shares for certificates evidencing shares
of Parent Common Stock into which such Shares were converted, and whether or
not such deemed Affiliate has executed and delivered a Company Affiliates
Letter.   6.11. PUBLICITY.   The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other prior to issuing, and will provide each other with a meaningful
opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any governmental entity with respect
thereto, except as may be required by law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service.   6.12. BENEFITS.   (a) STOCK
OPTIONS.   (i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each
Company Option in accordance with the terms of the relevant Company Stock
Plan under which it was issued and the stock option agreement by which it is
evidenced, provided that the assumed option shall be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Option, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equivalent to
(A) the number of Shares that could have been purchased immediately prior to
the Effective Time under such Company Option multiplied by (B) the     
- 44 -  49  Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a
price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price for each Share otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Company Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however,
that the foregoing provisions shall be subject to such adjustments as are
necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code
in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make all necessary
arrangements with respect to the Company Stock Plans to permit the assumption
of the unexercised Company Options by Parent pursuant to this SECTION 6.12,
including, to the extent required by the terms of the Company Stock Plans or
the Company Options, obtaining the written consent of the holders of the
Company Options.   (ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options
assumed by it in accordance with this Section. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate forms) (or shall cause such Company
Option to be deemed to be issued pursuant to a Parent Stock Plan for which
shares of Parent Common Stock have previously been registered pursuant to an
appropriate registration form) with respect to Parent Common Stock subject to
such Company Options.   (b) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (i) Parent agrees that,
from the Effective Time the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
remain in the employ of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Parent and
its Subsidiaries will be provided with benefits under employee benefit plans
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those benefits provided by the Parent and its Subsidiaries to
their other similarly situated employees. Following the Effective Time,
Parent shall honor, or shall cause the Surviving Company to honor, all
individual employment or severance agreements in effect for employees (or
former employees) of the Company as of the date hereof to the extent that
such individual agreements are in effect by their terms following the
Effective Time and are listed in SECTION 6.12(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Parent from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or agreement in accordance
with its terms.   (ii) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Company to continue the employment of each individual who
was      - 45 -  50  employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time for a period of time at least equal
to each such individual\'s Transition Period under the Company\'s Retention
Bonus Program that is described in SECTION 6.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (or pay following such individual\'s involuntary termination of
employment other than for any of cause, death or permanent disability in
accordance with Parent\'s disability plan generally available to its
employees, any amounts that would otherwise be owed such employee if such
employee remained in the Surviving Company\'s employ through the relevant
Transition Period) at a salary level at least as high as that set forth in
the list set forth in SECTION 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or
the salary level at which such employee started employment if hired between
the date hereof and the Effective Time). Immediately following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to enter into and honor (x)
the letter agreement attached as EXHIBIT B-1 with the party so named in such
agreement; (y) the change in control severance agreement attached as EXHIBIT
B-2 with the party so named in such agreement (if such party is not otherwise
a party to a change of control severance agreement with the Company that
survives the Effective Time); (z) a letter agreement, in the form attached as
EXHIBIT B-3, with each of the parties listed on EXHIBIT B-4 attached hereto;
and (xx) a change in control severance agreement, in the form attached as
EXHIBIT B-5, with each of the parties listed on EXHIBIT B-4 attached hereto
(if such party is not otherwise a party to a change of control severance
agreement with the Company that survives the Effective Time). In addition,
Parent agrees that, from the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide severance pay benefits to employees of
the Surviving Company in accordance with the severance pay guidelines of
Parent applicable to Parent employees in effect at the Effective Time.  
6.13. EXPENSES.   Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 8.5, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except
that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for the S-4
Registration Statement and printing and mailing the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.   6.14.
INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.   (a) From and after
the Effective Time for a period of seven years, Parent agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company (when acting in such capacity or when      - 46 - 
51  acting as a fiduciary at the request of the Company under or with
respect to a Company Compensation and Benefit Plan) (each, an Indemnified
Party and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, amounts paid in settlement claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, actual or threatened, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, based on or arising in whole or in part out
of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
any such matters involving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law
and its charter or by-laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such
Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law provided the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides (i) a written affirmation of his or her good faith
belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been
met, and (ii) an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).   (b)
Parent shall cause to be maintained, for a period of not less than seven
years from the Effective Time, the Company\'s current directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance policy to the extent that it provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO;
Insurance") for all present and former directors and officers of the Company
or any subsidiary thereof, so long as the annual premium therefor would not
be in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid for the DandO; Insurance
prior to the date of this Agreement (150% of such premium, the "Maximum
Premium"); provided that Parent may, in lieu of maintaining such existing
DandO; Insurance as provided above, cause no less favorable coverage to be
provided under any policy maintained for the benefit of the directors and
officers of Parent or a separate policy provided by the same insurer. If the
existing DandO; Insurance expires, is terminated or canceled by the insurer or
if the annual premium therefor would exceed the Maximum Premium during such
period, Parent shall obtain, if reasonably possible, in lieu of such DandO;
Insurance, such comparable directors\' and officers\' liability insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium
not in excess of the Maximum Premium and on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the existing DandO; Insurance. In addition, from and after
the Effective Time for a period of seven years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect any Company-paid fiduciary
liability insurance policies for employees who serve or have served as
fiduciaries under or with respect to any Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan at the request of the Company and with coverages and in amounts no less
favorable than those policies of the Company      - 47 -  52  or any
of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof, so long as the
annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 150% of the last annual
premium paid for such insurance by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement.   (c) The provisions of this Section are in addition to the
rights that an Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or agreements of or with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or under applicable law. Parent agrees to pay all costs and
expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other
obligations under this Section.   (d) In the event that Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
assume the obligations set forth in this Section.   6.15. OTHER ACTIONS BY
THE COMPANY AND PARENT.   (a) The Company shall take all necessary action
with respect to all of the outstanding Company Rights so that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (i) neither the Company nor Parent will have any
obligations under the Company Rights or the Company Rights Agreement and (ii)
the holders of the Company Rights will have no rights under the Company
Rights or the Company Rights Agreement. Without Parent\'s prior written
consent, the Company shall not redeem any Company Rights or modify or
terminate the Company Rights Agreement.   (b) If any Takeover Statute is or
may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement, or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.   (c) The
Company and Parent will take all actions necessary to promptly make the
filings required of it or its affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will comply with all
requests for additional information received from the
appropriate governmental authorities and will request early termination of
the HSR Act waiting period.     - 48 -  53   6.16 BOARD OF
DIRECTORS.   Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent\'s Board of
Directors shall be expanded by three and three persons currently serving on
