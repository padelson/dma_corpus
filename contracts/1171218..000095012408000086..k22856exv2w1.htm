ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS  

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. 

   

Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable Law) of the conditions of this Agreement (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing
shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) and 

   ##### 

  

    

in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. 

   

Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE VII, the closing of the Merger (the "

the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
MBCA (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth, or such later date and time
as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the
parties hereto, being the " _Effective Time_ ") and the parties hereto shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the MBCA in connection
with the Merger. 

  

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. 

   

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the MBCA, including Section 724(1) of the MBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

Section 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

   

At the Effective Time, ( _a_ ) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall by virtue of the Merger be restated to read in its entirety
as the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be North Pointe Holdings Corporation, until amended or restated
in accordance with the MBCA (the form of the restatement of the Surviving
Corporations Articles of Incorporation is attached to this Agreement as
_Exhibit 1.4_) and ( _b_ ) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall by
virtue of the Merger be amended and restated so as to read in their entirety
as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except the references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced by
references to North Pointe Holdings Corporation, until amended or restated in
accordance with the MBCA; _provided_ that the advancement of expenses,
exculpation and indemnification provisions contained in the
Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect from and after
the Effective Time, 

   ##### 

  

    

until the sixth (6th) year anniversary of the Effective Time, shall not ( _i_
) be any less favorable in any respect than those contained in the Companys
Constituent Documents as of the date hereof and ( _ii_ ) contain any
provision inconsistent with the provisions of Section 6.9(a). 

  

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. 

   

The directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company (other than those
who Merger Sub determines shall not remain as officers of the Surviving
Corporation), in each case, as of the Effective Time, shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving
Corporation. 

  

Section 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

   

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities: 

  

(a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

(b) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (such
shares, collectively, the " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive in cash an amount
per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section
2.2) equal to $16.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer remain outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall be retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate theretofore representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the sole right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificates in accordance with Section 2.1(b), without interest. 

  

(c) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company, or otherwise owned by
Parent or Merger Sub, or owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of such
Persons, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled without
any conversion thereof and shall be retired and cease to exist and no
consideration shall be paid with respect thereto. 

  

Section 1.7 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. 

   

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of the Options,
each Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished
and automatically converted into solely the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such 

   ##### 

  

    

Option and (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Option. In the event
the exercise price of any Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Option shall be cancelled without payment therefor and
shall have no further force or effect. 

  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted or
deferred Shares (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be
automatically converted into solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(b), subject to any
applicable withholding Tax. 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause to be effected any
necessary amendments to the Company Stock Plans and any other resolutions,
consents, notices or actions, in such form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
as may reasonably be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
Section 1.7 and without any further compensation except as provided in
this Agreement. 

  

Section 1.8 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. 

   

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with
this sentence. 

  

Section 1.9 _Plan of Merger_. 

   

The plan of merger contemplated by Section 701(2) of the MBCA is attached as
_Exhibit 1.9_. The plan of merger at _Exhibit 1.9_ is hereby incorporated
by reference herein and all references to this "Agreement" shall be deemed to
include the plan of merger. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

PAYMENT AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; WITHHOLDING  

  

Section 2.1 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall deposit in trust with the Paying Agent the aggregate consideration to
which shareholders become entitled pursuant to ARTICLE I. Until used for that
purpose, the funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that no investment income or loss thereon
shall affect the amount payable to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to
this ARTICLE II. 

   ##### 

  

  

(b) Promptly and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person who was a record holder of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares were converted pursuant
to ARTICLE I into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, ( _i_ ) a
form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in order to
receive payment of the Merger Consideration (which, for certificated Shares,
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)), and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
Company may reasonably agree and ( _ii_ ) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with a properly
completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other documents as may
be reasonably required by such instructions, the Paying Agent shall promptly
pay to the holder of the Shares, the Merger Consideration with regard to each
Share represented by such Certificate, affidavit or Book-Entry Share, less any
required Tax withholdings in accordance with Section 2.2, and such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be canceled. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person
holding a Certificate other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and the Person who surrenders the Certificate
must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that all Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. After the
Effective Time, a Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without any
interest thereon. All cash paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. 

  

(c) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to accept an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
instead of the Certificate; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may
require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving Corporation
a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

(d) At any time which is more than one (1) year after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been deposited with the Paying Agent and
have not been disbursed in accordance with this ARTICLE II
(including interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect
of the funds made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, 

   ##### 

  

    

Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this ARTICLE II shall be
entitled to look solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any
interest thereon;  _provided_ , that such Persons shall have no greater
rights against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general
creditors of the Surviving Corporation under applicable Laws. Any portion of
the funds deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, any
of their respective Affiliates or the Paying Agent will be liable to any
Person entitled to payment under this ARTICLE II for any consideration which
is delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not
record on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and treated
as having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Shares represented thereby. 

  

Section 2.2 _Withholding Rights_. 

   

Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Options, other awards
granted under the Company Incentive Plans, or any other equity rights in the
Company, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state or local Law or the Laws of
any other domestic or foreign jurisdiction. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

Section 2.3 _Further Action_. 

   

After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

pursuant to the Exchange Act did not, and each such Company SEC Document
filed subsequent to the date hereof on the date of its filing will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC staff with respect to any of
the Company SEC Documents. 

  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

therein not misleading. 

  

(e) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of SOX. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Sections 302
or 906 of SOX or Rules 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and the
statements contained in all such certifications were as of their respective
dates made, and are, complete and correct. Except for (i) requests to extend
the duration of confidential treatment of redacted portions of exhibits filed
with the SEC, (ii) correspondence relating to SEC reviews and comments as to
which no comments remain outstanding, and (iii) as are available in EDGAR,
the Company has provided to Parent copies of all correspondence sent to or

since January 21, 2005. There are no outstanding comments from or unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents. 

  

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that ( _i_ ) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; ( _ii_ )
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP (and/or SAP) and to maintain asset
accountability; ( _iii_ ) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization; and ( _iv_ ) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences. Since September 23, 2005, the Company has not received any
oral or written notification of a (x) "significant deficiency" or (y)
"material weakness" in its internal controls. The terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in the PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5, as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

(g) The management of the Company has, (x) designed and maintained disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act),
or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed and
maintained under their supervision, to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Company SEC Documents, including its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required under Section 302 of SOX; and (y) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to the Companys outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys 

   ##### 

  

    

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. The Company has disclosed to
Parent all matters set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above discovered or
disclosed since September 23, 2005. Since September 23, 2005, any material
change in internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed
in any Company SEC Documents has been so disclosed. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no reason to believe that the Company, its auditors and its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as the case may be, will
not be able to provide the reports, certifications or attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations applicable to the Company adopted
pursuant to Section 302 or Section 404 of SOX or Items 307 or 308 of
Regulation S-K when the Company next files an Annual Report on Form 10-K and a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, without limitation as
to the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. 

  

(h) Since September 23, 2005, (x) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls relating to periods after September 23, 2005, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices (except for any of the foregoing after the date hereof which have
been determined by the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors to
have no reasonable basis), and (y) to the Knowledge of the Company, no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation, relating to periods after September 23, 2005, by the Company or
any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or
any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

thereto), the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim

Documents complied or will comply as of their respective dates as to form in
all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as

30, 2007, ( _ii_ ) for liabilities and obligations incurred since September
30, 2007 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
or ( _iii_ ) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any material liabilities or
obligations (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company. 

  

Section 3.10 _Company SAP Statements_. 

   

(a) As used herein, the term " _Company SAP Statements_ " means the statutory
statements of each of the Company Subsidiaries conducting insurance
operations (referred to herein as "insurance Company Subsidiaries") as filed
with the applicable insurance regulatory authorities in their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2007 and any such annual and quarterly
statutory statements filed with the applicable insurance regulatory
authorities in their respective jurisdictions of incorporation subsequent to
the date hereof. Each of the insurance Company Subsidiaries has filed or
submitted all Company SAP Statements required to be filed with or submitted
to the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction in
which it is domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by such authority,
except for such failures to file that have not had and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company SAP Statements were, and
any Company SAP Statements filed after the date hereof will be, prepared in
all material respects in conformity with SAP consistently applied for the
periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and
the Company SAP Statements present, and any Company SAP Statements filed

which annual premiums in the first year are reasonably expected to exceed
$3,000,000, or other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices offer any new insurance product; or 

  

(r) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

  

ARTICLE VI  

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  

  

Section 6.1 _SEC Filings_. 

  

The Company shall prepare and file a preliminary proxy statement to be used in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement (with a reasonably complete first draft to be provided to Parent no
later than 15 days following the date hereof). The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any written or oral comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information with respect to the Proxy Statement and will supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable and timely opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement or any amendment, supplement or SEC response, and shall give
due consideration to inclusion in the Proxy Statement or any such amendment,
supplement or SEC response the comments reasonably proposed by Parent. Any
such filing, amendment, supplement or response shall be made as soon as
reasonably practicable after receiving any comments from Parent. The Company
and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with
the other party, to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement as reasonably promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the 

   ##### 

  

    

SEC as promptly as practicable after filing. The Company will advise Parent
promptly after it receives notice that the Proxy Statement has been cleared
by the SEC or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement. To
the extent permitted by Law, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after
the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or
that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. If at any time
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting there shall occur any event
(including discovery of any fact, circumstance or event by any party hereto)
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to
its shareholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall cooperate reasonably with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, including supplying information for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement in a timely manner provided
the Company has given Parent reasonable advance notice thereof. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file or
furnish with or to the SEC any document required by the Exchange Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be so
filed or furnished. 

  

Section 6.2 _Company Shareholders Meeting; Board Recommendation_. 

  

As promptly as practicable after the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement, the
Company, acting through its Board of Directors, and in accordance with
applicable Law and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, shall ( _i_ ) take
all action required to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders (including any postponement or adjournment thereof) for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ "), including mailing the Proxy Statement as soon as
reasonably practicable after such clearance and holding the Company
Shareholders Meeting no later than 35 calendar days after mailing the
Proxy Statement and ( _ii_ ) subject to Section 6.3(c), include in the Proxy
Statement the Board Recommendation. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not condition its submission of this Agreement or the Merger to the
shareholders of the Company on any basis other than receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Vote. Except in accordance with Section 6.3(c), neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company shall ( _A_ ) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse
to Parent in any material respect), or publicly propose to withdraw the Board
Recommendation (it being understood that the Board of Directors may take no
position with respect to a Takeover Proposal that takes the form of a
tender offer until the close of business as of the tenth Business Day after
the commencement of such tender offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse modification), (
_B_ ) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (
_C_ ) knowingly take any other action or knowingly make any other public
statement that is knowingly inconsistent in any material respect with such
Board Recommendation (any action described in these clauses (A), (B), or (C)
being referred to as a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "). Notwithstanding any
Recommendation Withdrawal, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to,
and in accordance with, Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and, in
such case, the Board of 

   ##### 

  

    

Directors of the Company shall comply with the further requirements of Section
703a(2)(a) of the MBCA. 

  

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_. 

  

(a) Subject to Sections 6.3(b) and (c), until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage the submission of any inquiries, proposals
or offers, provide any non-public information or data or access to any Person
relating to or in connection with a potential Takeover Proposal, or knowingly
make any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or
knowingly assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, ( _ii_ ) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of
the Company, a Takeover Proposal, ( _iii_ ) enter into any merger
agreement, letter of intent or other agreement providing for or relating to a
Takeover Proposal, ( _iv_ ) enter into any agreement requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, ( _v_ ) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any
provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any
Person other than Parent or ( _vi_ ) agree or publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement
with any Person and any other activities conducted heretofore with respect to
any Takeover Proposal and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
6.3, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, including by requesting the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
by using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain injunctions or other
equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in a court of
competent jurisdiction. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(a), if at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, ( _i_ ) the Company
receives an unsolicited Takeover Proposal from any other third party, and (
_ii_ ) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with JPMorgan or another independent outside financial advisor
and outside counsel) that ( _A_ ) such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and ( _B_ ) the
failure to provide non-public information concerning the Company or enter
into discussions or negotiations with such third party would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company
may take the following actions: ( _x_ ) furnish information to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal (only after entering into a Qualifying
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person) and any such information provided
to such Person shall promptly be provided to Parent if it was not previously
provided, and ( _y_ ) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person with respect to the Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent
orally and in writing of the receipt of ( _i_ ) the Board of Directors of the
Companys determination to take any action described in the preceding
sentence, ( _ii_ ) any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal and the 

   ##### 

  

    

material terms of such proposal, including the identity of the Person(s)
making such proposal and its substance, and, if applicable, providing copies
of any documents or correspondence evidencing such proposal, and ( _iii_ )
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be
related to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall thereafter keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis (and in any event within 48
hours of the occurrence of any such developments, discussions or
negotiations) of the status and any material developments, discussions
and negotiations concerning such Takeover Proposal (including any material
change to the terms thereof). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, the Board of Directors of
the Company may effect a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
During the two days prior to a Recommendation Withdrawal based on the
existence of a Superior Proposal the Company shall, and shall direct its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the subject Takeover Proposal ceases to
be a Superior Proposal. In the event that any material revisions (or
revisions that in the aggregate are material) are made to the subject
Takeover Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent within one Business
Day written notice of any such material revisions (including a detailed
description thereof) and Parent shall have an additional two business days to
negotiate modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the subject Takeover Proposal again ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Whether
or not Parent and the Company enter into any such negotiation, Parents
rights under ARTICLE VIII to the Termination Fee and/or Termination
Expenses shall not be affected. 

  

(d) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 6.3(a) by the
Company. 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company from (
_i_ ) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with
regard to a Takeover Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, ( _ii_ ) making any required disclosure
to the Companys shareholders if, after consultation with its outside counsel,
the Company determines that failure to disclose such information would
violate its obligations under applicable Law, or ( _iii_ ) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.3;
_provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement;
and  _provided_ _further_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation
Withdrawal unless the Board of Directors of the Company
concurrently reaffirms its recommendation of the Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
or group of Persons other than Parent or its Affiliates relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 15%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class or
series of securities of the Company (or any Company Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole), any tender offer (including self-tenders) or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class or series of capital stock of, or economic or
voting interest in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Company Subsidiary or Subsidiaries
whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); 

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Takeover Proposal (except that
references to 15% will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%") from a
third party, not solicited in violation of this Agreement, made in writing
that ( _i_ ) is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in good
faith determines (after consultation with the Companys independent legal
and financial advisors, and considering the identity of the offeror, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the
terms of any financing and the likelihood that the transaction will be
consummated and such other matters as the Board of Directors of the
Company deems relevant), are more favorable to its shareholders (in their
capacities as shareholders), from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated hereby, and ( _ii_ ) is in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company otherwise reasonably
capable of being completed on its terms (including any terms related to
financing). 

  

Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. 

  

The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, directors, employees, general or limited partners (if applicable),
managing members (if applicable), Affiliates, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors, consultants, financing sources, and other professional advisors or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours to all of the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries properties, books, records, contracts, commitments and
personnel, and shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as
practicable to Parent ( _a_ ) a copy of each material report, schedule and
other document filed, furnished, or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws or a
Governmental Entity (other than routine filings, correspondence, reports,
circulars or invoices), and ( _b_ ) all information as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_ that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to
those Persons who have entered into or are bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Company and to the extent required by applicable Law, and
further such access shall be subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from
time to time upon advice of counsel respecting the provision of privileged
communications or any applicable confidentiality agreement with any
Person (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain waivers 

   ##### 

  

    

under such agreements or implement requisite procedures to enable the
provision of reasonable access without violating such agreement). The Company
shall also, with respect to each fiscal month ending after the date of this
Agreement, furnish to Parent any "flash" or "management reports" relating to
the financial and operating performance of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and any unaudited monthly financial statements, in each
case to the extent made available to management of the Company, promptly
following their availability (it being understood and agreed that the Company
shall not be required to prepare any such reports solely for the purpose of
complying with the foregoing). In conducting any inspection of any properties
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and its Representatives
shall not ( _i_ ) interfere with the business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary conducted at such property, or ( _ii_ ) damage any property or any
portion thereof. All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall
continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement,  _provided_ that (
_x_ ) any requirement under the Confidentiality Agreement to obtain approval
for the disclosure of Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to potential financing sources shall be waived during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on any termination of this
Agreement, ( _y_ ) such Persons shall constitute "Representatives" for all
purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement, and ( _z_ ) such Persons shall be
entitled to use Evaluation Material solely for purposes of evaluating whether
to provide financing in connection with a Potential Transaction (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement). No investigation pursuant to this Section
6.4 or otherwise shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. 

  

Section 6.5 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

  

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
Laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
of the Company and Parent agrees to make, as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement and in any event within forty-five (45) calendar
days of the date of this Agreement, ( _i_ ) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, ( _ii_ ) appropriate
filings required by the Transaction Approvals, and ( _iii_ ) all other
necessary filings with any other Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably
requested pursuant to such requirements and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act in the most expeditious manner practicable.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take
any action that is intended to result in any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time, or in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in ARTICLE VII not being satisfied. 

  

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law or any rule, regulation or
restriction of a Governmental Entity, each of the Company and Parent shall,
in connection with the efforts referenced above to obtain all requisite
material approvals, clearances and authorizations for the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
approval of a Governmental Entity, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
( _i_ ) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, ( _ii_ )
promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any
other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, ( _iii_ ) permit the
other party, or the other partys legal counsel, to review any communication
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
( _iv_ ) unless prohibited by a Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other party and its legal counsel the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences. 

  

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each
of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or
private party may have to such transactions under such applicable Law,
including responding to any request for information from any such
Governmental Entity and complying with any requirements or conditions imposed
by any such Governmental Entity so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Merger, ( _i_ ) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any material amount of cash or
other consideration, make any material commitment or incur any material
liability or other material obligation due to such Person, and ( _ii_ )
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any material amount
of cash or other consideration, make any material commitment or to incur any
material liability or other material obligation; _provided_ , however, that
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company the opportunity to make such
payments or commitment or incur such obligation, in which event the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted by the amount of any payment made
or obligation incurred by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be required to offer, take or agree to any actions in connection
with any sale, divestiture, hold separate order or disposition of any of its
or its Affiliates or the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries businesses
or assets, nor shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary sell, divest or
dispose of any assets or business pursuant to the obligations of this Section
6.5 without the prior consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld in
Parents sole discretion. 

  

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_. 

  

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, for those employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who 

   ##### 

  

    

continue as employees of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation during such period, compensation (including base salary
and incentive compensation opportunities) and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company or
the applicable Company Subsidiary to such employees immediately before the
date of this Agreement (but excluding for all purposes, in each case, any
equity-based or long-term incentive plans or arrangements). The provisions of
this Section 6.6 shall not create in any current or former employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary any rights to employment or
continued employment with Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any right to any specific terms or conditions of employment.
Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment
for any current or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
or to restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate
any such employee without cause. 

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall ( _i_ ) waive any applicable pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of
the Surviving Corporation that an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to
the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had
been satisfied by, such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participated
or was eligible to participate, ( _ii_ ) provide each such employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductible amounts paid prior to the Effective
Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and ( _iii_ ) recognize service
prior to the Effective Time with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits (but not
for any other purpose, including benefit accrual purposes under any qualified
or nonqualified defined benefit plan of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries) to the same extent such service was recognized by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any similar Company Benefit
Plan (including vacation) in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service. 

  

(c) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.6, the Company shall
consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior
to sending any material notices or other material communication materials to
its employees or former employees. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to
such employees or former employees for purposes of Parent providing
reasonable notices or other communication materials regarding Parent
compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this Section 6.6,
_provided_ that such notices or other communication materials are reasonably
approved in advance by the Company. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, ( _i_ ) shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, or ( _ii_ )
shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit
Plan following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.6 with
respect to employees of the Company and the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall
create any third party beneficiary or other rights ( _x_ ) in any other
Person, including any current or former employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or ( _y_ ) to continued employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective affiliates or
continued participation in any Company Benefit Plan. 

  

Section 6.7 _Expenses_. 

  

Subject to Section 8.3, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As used in this
Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all documented out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) actually and
reasonably incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
preparation and filings of the Notification and Report Form required by the
HSR Act, the preparation, printing, filing and mailing, as the case may be, of
the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the
solicitation of the Requisite Shareholder Vote and all other matters related
to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

Section 6.8 _Transfer Taxes_. 

  

The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added,
stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company and Parent
shall be liable for the payment of any such Taxes, fees and similar items. 

  

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the greatest extent
permitted by Law, to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance reasonable
expenses as incurred to the greatest extent permitted by Law, the present
and former (and any individuals who may become prior to the Effective Time)
officers, and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and singularly the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative regulatory or investigative, in which the
Indemnified Party is or may be a defendant, and which arises out of, relates
to or is in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred, prior to or at the Effective Time, and which are based on
or arises out of the fact that the Indemnified Party was an officer, director
or employee of the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries, including the
approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or arising out 

   ##### 

  

    

of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, provided that
any such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking, to the extent permitted
by the MBCA, to repay such advancement if it is ultimately determined that
the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification and/or advancement.
Such indemnification and advancement referred to herein shall only apply in
excess of any and all available insurance, including, but not limited to,
directors and officers liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance and
errors and omissions insurance available to the Indemnified Party. 

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute
policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a
"tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts, and
containing terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are not
less advantageous in the aggregate than such policies with respect to
coverage for liability for claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that ( _i_ ) such
policies may, in the Surviving Corporations sole discretion, be one or more
"tail" policies for all or any portion of the full six-year period; and (
_ii_ ) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more
than an amount per year equal to 250% of the current premium (on an
annualized basis) paid prior to the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance as specified in Section 6.9(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage
pursuant hereto and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the amount of the
annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or
procure, for such six-year period, the most advantageous policy of directors
and officers insurance (including, in the reasonable judgment of the
Surviving Corporation, "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount. Section 6.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Companys last annual premium paid prior
to the date hereof and the current premium (on an annualized basis) paid
prior to the date hereof for its officers and directors liability

also being an effective termination and abandonment by Merger Sub) as
follows: 

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; 

   

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if: 

  

 (i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2008 (the " _Outside Date_ "); except that if the only reason for not consummating by July 31, 2008 is the non-expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act (or any extension thereof), then the Outside Date shall be extended to October 1, 2008; _provided,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose material breach of this Agreement primarily contributes to the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date;

 (iii) the Requisite Shareholder Vote shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting. 

   

(c) by Parent: 

  

 (i) provided Parent is not then in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform ( _A_ ) has not been cured or is incapable of being cured by the Company prior to the earlier of ( _x_ ) the Outside Date, and ( _y_ ) thirty (30) days following written notice to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub of such breach, and ( _B_ ) would result in a failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b); 

   

 (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have ( _A_ ) failed to recommend approval of this Agreement or the Merger to the shareholders of the 

    ##### 

  

  

Company or effected a Recommendation Withdrawal (or shall have disclosed its
intention to make a Recommendation Withdrawal), ( _B_ ) recommended to the
shareholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, ( _C_ ) determined that any
Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, or ( _D_ ) failed to have called,
given notice of, convened and held a Company Shareholders Meeting and to have
taken a vote of shareholders to approve this Agreement and the Merger in
breach in any material respect of its obligations under this Agreement to do
so; 

  

 (iii) if the Company shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3(a); or 

   

 (iv) if a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of the Company recommends that the shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Companys shareholders within ten (10) Business Days after such commencement (including by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Companys shareholders).

 (ii) only prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal if: ( _x_ ) in light of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have determined in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with outside counsel that the failure by the Company Board to effect a change of Board recommendation would violate their fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; ( _y_ ) taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent following receipt of the notice referred to in Section 6.3(b), such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and ( _z_ ) the Company has complied with its obligations under this Agreement.

respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, subject to Section 8.3(e). 

   ##### 

  

  

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by: ( _i_ ) Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(ii), Section 8.1(c)(iii) or Section 8.1(c)(iv); ( _ii_ )
the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii); or ( _iii_ ) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii), provided that

directed in writing by Parent promptly (but in any event within two (2)

(b) If any Shares held by either (I) the Chief Executive Officer of the

Financial Officer of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, or any
shares of Company Common Stock acquired by any such officer after the date
hereof (regardless of the manner in which they are acquired) and prior to the
time of the taking of a vote to adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger (a "Shareholder Vote"), are not voted in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger (whether such shares ( _i_ ) are
voted against such adoption and approval, ( _ii_ ) abstain from voting or (
_iii_ ) are not voted) at the Company Shareholders Meeting (or any
adjournment thereof) at which a Shareholder Vote is taken, and the Requisite
Shareholder Vote is not obtained, then the Company shall pay the Termination
Fee as directed in writing by Parent promptly (but in any event within two
(2) Business Days) following termination of this Agreement. 

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by ( _i_ ) Parent for any
reason permitted under this Agreement other than ( _x_ ) pursuant to Section
8.1(a), or ( _y_ ) pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) (unless the reason for such
termination is the failure to have occurred a vote of the shareholders of the
Company with respect to the approval of this Agreement at the
Company Shareholders Meeting) or ( _z_ ) the failure to obtain Transaction
Approvals; unless the reason for any such termination pursuant to clause (y)
or (z) is a breach of this Agreement by the Company, or ( _ii_ ) the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii); then, in addition to
any Termination Fee due, the Company shall pay promptly (but in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following receipt of an invoice therefor the
Termination Expenses as directed by Parent in writing. As used herein, "
_Termination Expenses_ " means Parents reasonable and properly documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and

(d) Any amount that becomes payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
or Section 8.3(a) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent. The parties hereto agree and
understand that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses on more than one occasion. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
in Section 8.3(a), Section 8.3(b) and/or Section 8.3(c), as the case may be,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results 

   ##### 

  

    

in a judgment against the Company for any of the amounts set forth in Section
8.3(a), Section 8.3(b) and/or Section 8.3(c), as the case may be, then: ( _i_
) the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, and ( _ii_ ) interest shall
accrue on any amounts due, from and after the date such amount is due until
paid in full at an annual rate equal to the prime rate prevailing during such
period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily
basis, but not in excess of the maximum rate permitted by Law. 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee or the Termination Expenses
if immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement Parent was in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement. In addition, the
parties hereby acknowledge that in the event the Termination Fee or the
Termination Expenses become payable and are paid by the Company pursuant to
this Section 8.3 (except in the case of any fraud or intentional breach or
breach of the representations set forth in Section 3.24, Section 4.8 or the
covenants set forth in Section 6.4), the receipt of such amount shall be
Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
under this Agreement. 

  

Section 8.4 _Procedure for Termination_. 

  

A termination of this Agreement and or abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective,
require in the case of each of Parent and Merger Sub, action by its Board of
Directors or, to the extent permitted by Law, the duly authorized designee of
its Board of Directors, and in the case of the Company, to the extent
permitted by Law, action by the Board of Directors of the Company.
