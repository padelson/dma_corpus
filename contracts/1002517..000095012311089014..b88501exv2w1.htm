respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both

Parent and the Company, (b)&nbsp;are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
hereunder, and (c)&nbsp;shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the consent of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.6 <B><I>Other Remedies; Specific Performance</I></B>. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

conflicts of laws thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of any court within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter
based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process
may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such
persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.8 <B><I>Rules of Construction</I></B>. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Nothing in the
Disclosure Letter hereto shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or
warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Letter identifies the exception with reasonable
particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item
shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein
(unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item
thereof). The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein
shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation,
warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
specificity) that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. In addition, each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that any purchase price adjustment as a result of the application
of any provision of this Agreement, the Articles of Merger or any of the other agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby does not prejudice or limit in any respect whatsoever any party&#146;s
