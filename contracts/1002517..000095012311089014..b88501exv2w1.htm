All such Lease Agreements are in full force and effect and are valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. There is not, under any Lease Agreements, any existing default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) of the Company, or to the Companys Knowledge, any other party thereto. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair the rights of the Company or alter the rights or obligations of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Lease Agreements, or otherwise adversely affect the continued use and possession of the Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted. The Company currently occupies all of the Leased Real Property for the operation of its business, and there are no other parties occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real Property.

   ##### 

  

    

such commission is owed with respect to any of the Leased Real Property. The

to any Leased Real Property and would not owe any such fees if any existing
Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in
such Lease Agreements.

   ##### 

  

    

amount of any Company Third Party Expenses reflected on the Statement of

The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Material Contract (including with respect to the Lease Agreements) as are required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any such Material Contracts to remain in full force and effect so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Surviving Corporation or a Company Subsidiary under such Contract from and after the Effective Time.

the extent any individual dollar amounts set forth in Schedule 4.9 require

withheld. 

  

 (a) The portion of the Retention Payment Amount to be allocated to each Continuing Employee (the " _Cash Retention Award_ ") shall provide that, contingent on the Continuing Employees continued employment with Parent, the percentages of such Continuing Employees Cash Retention Award shall vest and become payable according to the vesting schedule set forth in _Schedule 4.9_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that (1) such Continuing Employee dies or becomes permanently disabled, then any then unvested Cash Retention Award shall accelerate in full and be immediately payable or (2) such Continuing Employees employment is terminated without Cause (as such term is defined in Schedule 4.9 for purposes of this Section 4.9), then, upon receipt by Parent of a general release of claims in a form satisfactory to Parent, any then unvested Cash Retention Award shall accelerate in full and be payable as severance pursuant to Parents severance policy, as an accelerated retention bonus or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent on the sixtieth (60th ) day following such termination of employment; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that such payment of unvested Cash Retention Amount is subject to (and not exempt from) Section 409A of the Code, termination of your employment shall mean a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and Section 1.409A-1(h) of the regulations thereunder and permanent disability shall mean a "Disability" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and Section 1.409A-3(i)(4) of the regulations thereunder.

   #####

obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not

 6.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Survival Date"),  _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 hereof shall survive indefinitely, and _provided further, however_ , that if, at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Survival Date, an Officers Certificate is delivered alleging Losses and a claim for recovery meeting the requirements of and otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the Survival Date until such claim is fully and finally resolved. The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the Closing and shall continue to remain in full force and effect in perpetuity after the Closing Date, unless they terminate earlier in accordance with their express terms. 

  

 6.2 _Indemnification_. The Shareholders and Optionholders agree to indemnify and hold Parent and its employees, officers, directors, and affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation (the "Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, Taxes, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable accounting and auditors fees, reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable expenses of investigation and defense, interest, fines, penalties and diminution in value (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of, or with respect to or in connection with (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or, in the case of a Third Party Claim any allegation that, if true, would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy, (b) any failure by the Company to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant or obligation applicable to it contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) any Excess Third Party Expenses, (d) any Dissenting Share Payments, (e) any and all Company Debt, to the extent such Company Debt exceeds the amount of Company Debt deducted from the Upfront Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(cli) ("Excess Company Debt") and (f) any inaccuracies in the Payment Schedule without regard to supplemental information provided therein and not required by Section 1.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholders and Optionholders shall not be required to indemnify or hold the Indemnified Parties harmless against any Losses incurred by a settlement of any allegation in a Third Party Claim that, if true, would constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of (i) the Shareholder Representative prior to the Contingent Consideration Payment Date or (ii) a Majority In Interest after the Contingent Consideration Payment Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the 

   ##### 

  

    

foregoing limitation shall not apply to any actual breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement that gives rise to a Third Party Claim.
The Shareholders and Optionholders shall not have any right of contribution
from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by
an Indemnified Party. 

  

 6.3 _Contingent Consideration; Escrow; Setoff_. 

  

 (a) _Contingent Consideration_. Subject to the following requirements and limitations, on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, Parent shall release the Contingent Consideration (other than amounts that are reasonably necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied indemnification claims made pursuant to Section 6.2, which claims are specified in an Officers Certificate delivered to the Shareholder Representative meeting the requirements of and otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4(b) on or prior to the Survival Date in the case of representations or warranties that terminate on the Survival Date and the Contingent Consideration Payment Date in the case of all other claims) (i) to the Paying Agent for payment to each Shareholder based on their respective Pro Rata Portion of the Contingent Consideration and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation for payment to each Optionholder of the Contingent Option Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable following the settlement of any such unsatisfied claims and no later than five (5) Business Days after such settlement, in connection with which any portion of the Contingent Consideration was not released to the Paying Agent for payment to the Shareholders or to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the Optionholders on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, Parent shall release such portion of the Contingent Consideration to the Paying Agent for payment to the Shareholders based on their respective Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration and to the Surviving Corporation for payment to each Optionholder the Contingent Option Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Escrow_. At any time after the date hereof and prior to the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, Parent may deposit in an escrow account with the Paying Agent shares of Parent common stock with a fair market value, as of the date of deposit with the Paying Agent, equal to the amount of the Contingent Consideration as of the date of deposit, and, by instructing the Paying Agent to sell such shares of Parent common stock in a lawful manner and on Parents behalf, may thereby produce the cash necessary to pay the Contingent Consideration pursuant to this Section 6.3(a); _provided, however_ that (i) as of the Contingent Consideration Payment Date such escrow account shall contain an amount in cash equal to the Contingent Consideration, less any amounts forfeited pursuant to Section 6.3(d) or used to satisfy indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article VI (ii) Parent shall deposit on or before the Contingent Consideration Payment Date additional cash into the escrow account as may be necessary to ensure that the escrow account contains the amount of cash contemplated by subclause (i) above, (iii) all payments to the Shareholders of the Contingent Consideration shall be made in cash and not in shares of Parent common stock, (iv) the Shareholders shall not be deemed to be beneficial owners or selling shareholders of the shares of Parent common stock deposited into the escrow account as contemplated by this Section 6.3(b), and (v) any amount in the escrow account in excess of the Contingent Consideration payable to the Shareholders and Optionholders shall be released to Parent as provided in the Escrow Agreement. In the event that Parent uses an escrow account for the 

   ##### 

  

   

Contingent Consideration in accordance with the previous sentence, all
payments from such escrow account will be governed by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K; _provided,
however_ , that in the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, on the one hand, and the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement, on the other hand, with respect to the rights and duties of
Parent and the Company with respect to payments of the Contingent
Consideration and claims for indemnification, the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall govern. 

   

 (c) _Setoff Against Contingent Consideration_. If, at any time on or before the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, Parent delivers to the Shareholder Representative an Officers Certificate, meeting the requirements of and otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4(b), subject to the provisions of Section 6.4 and Section 6.6, the Contingent Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Losses, up to a maximum aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000. Where the basis for a claim upon the Contingent Consideration by an Indemnified Party is that such Indemnified Party reasonably anticipates that it will incur or pay a Loss (a "Contingent Loss"), no reduction will be made to the Contingent Consideration for such Contingent Loss unless and until such Contingent Loss is actually incurred or paid and a further Officers Certificate with respect thereto is delivered to the Shareholder Representative; _provided, however,_ that the amount of such Contingent Loss shall not be released from the Contingent Consideration for payment to the Shareholders and Optionholders unless and until such Contingent Loss is incurred or paid or it is conclusively determined that no actual Loss is reasonably anticipated to be incurred or paid with regard thereto. 

   

 (d) _Contingent Consideration Forfeiture_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary: 

   

 (i) In the event that any one Executives employment with either Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, is terminated, other than termination for a Permitted Exception, prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Contingent Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (A) $12,500,000 and (B) the remaining balance of the Contingent Consideration. 

  

 (ii) In the event that two or more Executives employment with either Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, is terminated, other than termination for a Permitted Exception, prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Contingent Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (A) $25,000,000 and (B) the remaining balance of the Contingent Consideration. 

  

 (iii) In the event that any one Executives employment with either Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, is terminated, other than termination for a Permitted Exception, after 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Contingent Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (A) $8,330,000 _multiplied by_  each Executive the employment of whom is so terminated and (B) the remaining balance of the Contingent Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Any amount of the Contingent Consideration that is reduced pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) shall be forfeited as if such payments were never owed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement and the Shareholders and Optionholders shall have no further rights in or claims to such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction of the Contingent Consideration pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) shall not be limited by any amounts by which the Contingent Consideration has been reduced to satisfy indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article VI. 

  

 6.4 _Indemnification Claims._  

   

 (a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 6.4(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 6.2(a) unless and until the aggregate Losses for which such Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to receive indemnification hereunder exceed 1% of the Upfront Consideration (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard to the Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 6.2 hereof, and (B) Losses resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 or Section 2.4 hereof. 

   

 (b) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 6.2(a), Parent shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Shareholder Representative at any time on or before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Survival Date; _provided, however_ , that Parent may seek indemnification (i) for a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 hereof or (ii) for or with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 6.2 at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date by delivering an Officers Certificate to the Shareholder Representative; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Parent may seek indemnification (i) for a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 hereof, or (ii) for or with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 6.2 at any time after the Contingent Consideration Payment Date by delivering notice of its claim for indemnification to each Shareholder and Optionholder. Unless the Shareholder Representative or a Majority In Interest, as applicable, shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 6.4(c) hereof, the Shareholders shall promptly, and in no event later than the first Business Day after the applicable deadline for submitting an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 6.4(c)(i) or (ii), as applicable, by the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders and Optionholders, as applicable, deliver to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate (or Parent shall set off such Loss in accordance with Section 6.3, if applicable). Any payment to Indemnified Parties with respect to a claim for indemnification made prior to the Contingent Consideration Payment Date shall be made by reducing the Contingent Consideration (to the extent available) in an amount equal to such Loss pursuant to Section 6.3(b). From and after the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, and with respect to any indemnification claim that exceeds the remaining Contingent Consideration, any claim for indemnification may only be made by Parent seeking recovery directly from the Shareholders and Optionholders based on each Shareholder and 

   ##### 

  

   

Optionholders Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration. For the purposes
hereof, "Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent: (1) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained,
incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to
pay, sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the
date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued,
or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. 

   

 (c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. 

   

 (i) No payment shall be made under Section 6.4(b) with respect to a claim for indemnification made prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date if the Shareholder Representative shall object to the claim made in the Officers Certificate in a written statement labeled "Objection Notice" (an "Objection Notice"), and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to Parent prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate. If the Shareholder Representative does not object in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Shareholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.4(b). 

  

 (ii) No payment shall be made under Section 6.4(b) with respect to a claim for indemnification made after 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date if a Majority In Interest shall object to the claim made in the Officers Certificate in an Objection Notice and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to Parent prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the sixtieth (60th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate. If a Majority In Interest does not object in writing within such 60-day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Shareholders and Optionholders that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.4(b). 

  

 (d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) In case the Shareholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 6.4(c), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. 

  

 (ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by the Shareholder Representative to Parent or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to Article VI hereof, either Parent, on the one hand, or the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, may pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for 

   ##### 

  

   

indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, Parent shall notify the
Shareholder Representative in writing of such claim. 

   

 (i) If the Third Party Claim is brought by a Shareholder, Optionholder or an employee of the Company and exclusively arises out of facts or circumstances occurring prior to the Effective Time (a " _Shareholder Controlled Claim_ ") and such claim may result in a claim against the Contingent Consideration or the Shareholders or Optionholders, the Shareholder Representative, shall be entitled to participate in, or at its election, to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the participation, determination or conduct of the defense of such claim by the Shareholder Representative shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Shareholders and Optionholders; (ii) the assumption of the defense of such claim shall conclusively establish that such claim is within the scope of and subject to indemnification by the Shareholders and Optionholders; and (iii) no compromise or settlement of such claim may be effected by the Shareholder Representative without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party and Parent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party or Parent, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Shareholders and Optionholders (or may be set off in full against the Contingent Consideration in accordance with Section 6.3), and (C) neither the Indemnified Party nor Parent will have any liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claim without its consent. 

  

 (ii) If the Third Party Claim is not a Shareholder Controlled Claim and may result in a claim against the Contingent Consideration or the Shareholders or Optionholders, the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Shareholders, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders and Optionholders agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of participation, that Parents legal counsel in the Third Party Claim shall not be precluded from representing Parent as against the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders and Optionholders in the event that the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders and Optionholders dispute the fact or amount of the Parents claim of a Loss related to such matter. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and, subject to the last sentence of Section 6.2, to settle, any such claim. In the event that the Shareholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Shareholders and Optionholders shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent. 

  

 (f) _Indemnity Payment Net of Insurance Proceeds_. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article VI shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Parties on account of such Losses. If the amount of any Losses, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by, from or against any other entity, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Parties to the Shareholders and Optionholders. Notwithstanding anything to the 

   ##### 

  

   

contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require Indemnified Parties to seek
full or partial recovery under any insurance policies. 

   

 6.5 _Shareholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) (x) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Shareholders, each of the Shareholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Adrian Smith as its agent and attorney-in-fact, and (y) by virtue of the return of the Option Waiver and receipt of consideration in connection with their Company In the Money Options, each Optionholder shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Adrian Smith as its agent and attorney-in-fact, in each case as the Shareholder Representative for and on behalf of the Shareholders and Optionholders to take all actions under this Agreement that are to be taken by the Shareholder Representative, including to amend this Agreement, to waive any provision of this Agreement, to negotiate payments due pursuant to this Article VI, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party, including reductions in the Contingent Consideration pursuant to Section 6.3, in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Shareholder or Optionholder or by any such Shareholder or Optionholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Shareholder or Optionholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Shareholders and Optionholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Representative may not be removed unless Shareholders and Optionholders holding an amount equal to at least two-thirds in interest of the Contingent Consideration agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Shareholder Representative may be filled by the Shareholders and Optionholders holding an amount equal to at least two-thirds in interest of the Contingent Consideration. In the event a vacancy in the position of Shareholder Representative exists for fifteen (15) or more days, Parent shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a replacement Shareholder Representative. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for his services; provided, however, that the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement of his expenses from the Shareholder Representative Fund. Notices or communications to or from the Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Shareholders and Optionholders. 

   

 (b) The Shareholder Representative represents and warrants to Parent, the Shareholders and the Optionholders that he has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform this Agreement and to bind each of the Shareholders and Optionholders to its terms, (ii) to give and receive directions and notices hereunder and (iii) to make all determinations that may be required or that he deems appropriate under this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Until notified in writing by the Shareholder Representative that he has resigned, or that he has been removed by Shareholders holding an amount equal to at least two-thirds in interest of the Contingent Consideration, Parent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the Shareholder Representative named above and, thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor named in a writing executed by Shareholders and Optionholders holding an amount equal to at least two-thirds in interest of the Contingent Consideration. If for any reason there is no Shareholder Representative at any time, all references herein to the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Shareholders and Optionholders until a Shareholder Representative is appointed pursuant to Section 6.5(a). 

   

 (d) The Company, the Shareholders and the Optionholders each hereby authorize the Shareholder Representative to: 

   

 (i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Shareholders and Optionholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to receive and accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Shareholder Representative may in his sole discretion deem appropriate; and 

  

 (iii) Take such action as the Shareholder Representative may in his sole discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by Parent or Sub pursuant hereto; (B) taking such other action as the Shareholder Representative is authorized to take under this Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making all determinations, in his capacity as Shareholder Representative, required under this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to carry out any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this Article VI and any waiver of any obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation _._  

  

 (iv) Administer the Shareholder Representative Fund and pay any and all third-party expenses of the Shareholder Representative incurred in furtherance of his duties hereunder _._  

  

 (e) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Shareholders and Optionholders shall indemnify the Shareholder Representative and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholder Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder 

   ##### 

  

   

Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver
of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Shareholders and
Optionholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Shareholders and Optionholders; and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders and
Optionholders. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any person for
any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative. 

   

 (f) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with a third party bank to be appointed by the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder Representative Fund, to provide for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in connection with the performance of his duties under this Agreement. The deposit of the Shareholder Representative Fund by Parent to such bank shall completely discharge Parents obligations with respect to such amount, and in no event shall Parent have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for the manner in which the Shareholder Representative administers the Shareholder Representative Fund, or for causing or ensuring that all or any portion of the Shareholder Representative Fund is ultimately paid or distributed to the Shareholders and Optionholders. 

   

 (g) Upon the later of the Contingent Consideration Payment Date or the final resolution of any Objection Notice submitted with respect to a claim made in an Officers Certificate prior to the Contingent Consideration Payment Date, the Shareholder Representative shall distribute any funds remaining in the Shareholder Representative Fund to the Shareholders and Optionholders on a pro rata basis (based on the amount the Merger Consideration to which each Shareholder and Optionholder is otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 1.6). Any amounts due to Optionholders who are employees of the Surviving Corporation on the Contingent Consideration Payment Date shall be paid by the Shareholder Representative to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the Optionholders. Upon completion of the distribution of the Shareholder Representative Fund, the Shareholder Representatives duties and authority hereunder shall cease. 

   

 6.6 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.6(c) and Section 6.6(d) hereof, the maximum amount the Indemnified Parties may recover from the Shareholders and Optionholders, whether via a set-off against and reduction of the Contingent Consideration or otherwise for Losses, shall be limited to $10,000,000 in the aggregate. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 6.6(c) hereof, the maximum amount the Indemnified Parties may recover from a Shareholder or Optionholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 6.2 hereof for Losses shall be limited to the each Shareholder or Optionholders Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any party in respect of Losses arising out of any fraud, breaches of covenants or obligations or any willful breaches of representations and warranties on the part of such party (it is agreed and understood that the Survival Date and the Threshold Amount shall not apply in respect of any such Losses). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement (other than Section 6.6(b)) shall limit the liability of the Shareholders or Optionholders in respect of Losses arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 or Section 2.4 hereof or Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 6.2 hereof. 

   

 (e) The maximum amount the Indemnified Parties may recover from the Shareholders and Optionholders for Losses incurred in connection with any allegation in a Third Party Claim that, if true, would constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to $4,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Loss incurred in a Third Party Claim that constitutes an actual breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 6.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments._ Amounts paid to or on behalf of any person as indemnification under this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration. 

  

 6.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VI. Nothing in this Section 6.4(g) shall limit Parents right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any party shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   #####

 8.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 8.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Articles of Merger, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Letter, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, including that certain Nonsolicitation and Break-up Fee Agreement, dated as of June 14, 2011, by and between Parent and the Company, (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the consent of the parties hereto, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder in connection with a Parent change of control, or to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder in connection with any assignment to its affiliates. 

  

 8.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the 

   ##### 

  

    

application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void
or unenforceable provision. 

  

 8.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.7 _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. 

  

 8.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Nothing in the Disclosure Letter hereto shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Letter identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item thereof). The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. In addition, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that any purchase price adjustment as a result of the application of any provision of this Agreement, the Articles of Merger or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby does not prejudice or limit in any respect whatsoever any partys rights to indemnification under any other provision of 

   ##### 

  

    

this Agreement, the Articles of Merger or any other agreements contemplated
hereby or thereby, except to the extent that such a recovery would result in
a duplication of damages. All references to dollars or "$" shall refer to
U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. 

  

 8.9 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 8.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of Article VI relating to the Indemnified Parties (for which the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly), the provisions of Section 4.9 relating to the Acquisition Bonus Program (for which the Executives shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly), and the provisions of Section 4.16 (for which the Covered Persons shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. 

  

 8.12 _Consent to Representation by Fenwick and West LLP_. In the event of any dispute following the Closing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, and the Shareholder Representative and/or any Shareholders, on the other hand, Parent and Sub hereby consent to the representation by Fenwick and West LLP of the Shareholder Representative and/or any Shareholders, notwithstanding the prior representation of the Company by Fenwick and West LLP, and Parent and Sub hereby waive any right to object thereto on the basis of any conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, or similar claim. The Shareholder Representative acknowledges that they have not been represented by Fenwick and West LLP in connection with this Agreement, and have been represented in that respect by other counsel.
