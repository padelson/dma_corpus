ARTICLE  2 
  THE MERGER

 

 Section  2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged  with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with  the CBCA, and upon the terms set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate  existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation  (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its existence  under the laws of the State of Connecticut. As a result of the Merger, the Company  shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

 

 (b)  As soon as practicable (and, in any event, within five Business Days) after  satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions  to the Merger set forth in Article 8, other than conditions that by their nature  are to be satisfied at the Effective Time and will in fact be satisfied at the  Effective Time, a certificate of merger shall be duly prepared, executed and  acknowledged by Merger Sub and the Company and thereafter delivered to and filed  with the Secretary of State of the State of Connecticut pursuant to the CBCA  (the "Merger Certificate") and all other filings or records  required under the CBCA shall be made. The Merger shall become effective at  the Effective Time. As used herein, the term "Effective Time"  means such time as is mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent on the date  of filing of the Articles of Merger, or on such other subsequent date or time  as may be agreed by the Company and Parent. 

 

 (c)  The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 33-820 of the CBCA.  

  Section  2.02 _. Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of incorporation  of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation  of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided  therein or by applicable law. 

 

 Section  2.03 _. Bylaws._ At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall  be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended  as provided therein or by applicable law. 

 

 Section  2.04 _. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ From and after  the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified  in accordance with applicable law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective  Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers  of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving  Corporation. 

 

 Section  2.05 _. Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth  herein, including the conditions set forth in Article 8 and the termination  rights set forth in Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")  will take place on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, unless this  Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another  time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall  be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington  Avenue, New York, New York, 10017, unless another place is agreed to in writing  by the parties hereto. 

 

ARTICLE  3 
  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

 

 Section  3.01 _. Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the  Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any holder  of any shares of Company Common Stock: 

 

 (a)  All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by the Company as treasury  stock or that are owned by Parent, the Company or Merger Sub immediately prior  to the Effective Time (and in each case that are not held on behalf of or as  fiduciary for third parties) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled  and retired and shall cease to exist. 

 

 (b)  Subject to Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.05, each outstanding share of Company  Common Stock (together with the Company Rights attached thereto) issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into  the right to receive 0.4334 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a fully  paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (together with any cash  in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.05,  the "Merger 

  Consideration"). All  of such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be duly
authorized and validly issued  and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership  thereof.

 

 (c)  Each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Class A common stock  of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

 Section  3.02 _. Certain Adjustments._ If, between the date of this Agreement and  the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,  split-up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to,  or rights issued in respect of, the capital stock of Parent or the Company,  the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of  Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement  prior to such event. 

 

 Section  3.03 _. Company Stock Options and Other Equity-based Awards._ (a)  Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock  Option") granted under an equity compensation plan of the Company (a  "Company Stock Plan"), whether vested or unvested, that is  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent  a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at  the Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock  (a "Parent Stock Option") on the same terms and conditions  (including any option reload features relating to any Company Stock Option outstanding  on the date hereof or granted after the date hereof; _provided_ that any  hereafter granted Company Stock Option is granted in accordance with Section  6.02(s)) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option (but taking into  account any changes thereto, including any acceleration thereof, provided for  in the relevant Company Stock Plan, or in the related award document by reason  of the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Parent Common  Stock subject to each such Parent Stock Option shall be equal to the number  of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option  multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest  whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Stock Option shall have  an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar)  equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company Stock Option  divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , however, that in the case of  any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the  Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting  thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of  the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject  to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option and any  related stock appreciation right shall be determined in a manner consistent  with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  (b)  At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive  shares of Company Common Stock and each award of any kind consisting of, based  on or relating to shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock  Plan (including restricted stock, deferred stock awards, stock units, phantom  awards and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options (each, a  "Company Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested, which  is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent  a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and shall be  converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to Parent  Common Stock (a "Parent Stock-Based Award"), on the same terms  and conditions as were applicable under Company Stock-Based Awards (but taking  into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration thereof, provided  for in the relevant Company Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason  of the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Parent Common  Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number  of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock-Based Award multiplied  by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down if necessary to the nearest whole share  of Parent Common Stock. Any dividend equivalents credited to the account of  each holder of a Company Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain  credited to such holders account immediately following the Effective Time,  subject to adjustment in accordance with the foregoing. 

 

 (c)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the  holders of Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards any required  notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the relevant Company  Stock Plans and award documents and stating that such Company Stock Options  and Company Stock-Based Awards have been assumed by Parent and shall continue  in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required  by this Section 3.03 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the  relevant Company Stock Plans). 

 

 (d)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action for  the adjustment of Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards under  this Section 3.03. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent  Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that  will be subject to Parent Stock Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards as a result  of the actions contemplated by this Section 3.03. As soon as practicable following  the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 or  S-3, as the case may be (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 or S-3 is not  available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common  Stock subject to such Parent Stock Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards and  shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration  statements (and maintain the current status of the 

  prospectus or prospectuses contained  therein) for so long as such Parent
Stock Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards  remain outstanding.

 

 Section  3.04 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent  shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose  of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares  of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated  shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"),  as applicable. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed,  the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated  Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause  the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Company Common Stock at  the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify  that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated  Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

 

 (b)  Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into  the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive,  upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly  completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message"  by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange  Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated  Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of Company Common Stock represented  by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Common Stock  constituting part of the Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall  be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested  by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under  applicable law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each  such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective  Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.  

 

 (c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than  the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated  Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either  such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper  form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred  and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent  any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person  other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share  or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have  been paid or are not payable. 

  (d)  All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares  of Company Common Stock (together with the Company Rights attached thereto)  in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 (including any cash paid pursuant  to Section 3.04(g) or Section 3.05) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid  in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common  Stock (and Company Rights). 

 

 (e)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers  of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall  be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in  accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Section 3.04. 

 

 (f)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent  pursuant to Section 3.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares  of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned  to Parent upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company  Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.04  prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger  Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in  respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for  any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares  of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier  date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat  to or become property of any governmental authority) shall become, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims  or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

 

 (g)  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock constituting  part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional  shares as provided in Section 3.05, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates  not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates  or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,  as provided in this Section. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall  be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent  have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount  of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled  pursuant to Section 3.05 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions  with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the  date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate  payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date  after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a  

  payment date subsequent to surrender  or transfer payable with respect to
such securities.

 

 Section  3.05 _. No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock._ No fractional shares  of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares  of Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of Company Common Stock would  otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated  and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be  entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined  by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the  NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective  Time occurs by the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such  holder would otherwise have been entitled. As soon as practicable after the  determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such former holders of Company  Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall notify  Parent, and Parent shall ensure that there is deposited with the Exchange Agent  and shall cause the Exchange Agent to make available in accordance with this  Agreement such amounts to such former holders of Company Common Stock.  

 

 Section  3.06 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen  or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming  such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,  the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may  direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect  to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the  shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and unpaid dividends  and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof  pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

 Section  3.07 _. Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold  from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts  as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such  payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with  the relevant Taxing Authority by or on behalf of Parent, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the  Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by or on  behalf of Parent. 

 

 Section  3.08 _. Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the officers  and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to  execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation,  Merger Sub or the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances  

  and to take and do, in the name  and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation,
Merger Sub or the Company, any other  actions and things necessary to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise  in Parent or the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest  in, to and under any of
the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired  by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as a result of, or in connection with,  the Merger.

 

ARTICLE  4 
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF PARENT

 

 Except  as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, regardless of whether the relevant  Section herein refers to the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent represents and  warrants to the Company that: 

 

 Section  4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub  is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under  the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and Parent and its Subsidiaries  have all corporate, partnership or other similar powers and all governmental  licenses, authorizations, permits, consents, franchises, variances, exemptions,  orders and approvals required to carry on their business as now conducted (the  "Parent Permits"), except for those licenses, authorizations,  permits, consents, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals the  absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries  are in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the failure  to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected  to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is duly qualified to do business  as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where  such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure  to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of its incorporation,  Merger Sub has not engaged in any activities other than in connection with or  as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has heretofore delivered or made available  to the Company true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and  bylaws of Parent, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger  Sub, as currently in effect. 

 

 (b)  As used in this Agreement, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect"  means (i) a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),  properties, business, results of the operations or prospects of Parent and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than effects caused by changes in general  economic or securities markets conditions, changes that affect the businesses  in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate in general and which do not have  a materially disproportionate effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, and  

  changes resulting from the announcement  or proposed consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby or (ii) a material
impairment of the ability of Parent or Merger Sub  to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 

 Section  4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and performance  by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and  Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the corporate  powers of Parent and Merger Sub and, except for the Parent Shareholder Approval  and the approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by Parent  as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate action on the part of Parent. This Agreement has been duly executed  and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding agreement  of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance  with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting  creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless of whether such  enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The only  votes of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent necessary  in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement are the affirmative votes (the "Parent  Shareholder Transaction Approval") of the holders of Parent Common  Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, (A) representing  a majority of the votes eligible to be cast by such holders approving the amendment  of Parents articles of incorporation in accordance with Section 7.02(a)(i)(B),  (B) representing a majority of the voting power of such shares present and entitled  to vote to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the  Merger and (C) representing a majority of the voting power of such shares present  and entitled to vote to approve the amendment of Parents bylaws in accordance  with Section 7.02(a)(ii). The affirmative vote (the "Parent Shareholder  Charter Approval" and, together with the Parent Shareholder Transaction  Approval, the "Parent Shareholder Approval") of the holders  of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, voting together as a single  class, representing two-thirds of the votes eligible to be cast by such holders,  shall be required to amend Parents articles of incorporation to eliminate  Article V of the articles of incorporation, such that Parents articles  of incorporation shall be in accordance with Section 7.02(a)(i)(A).  

 

 (b)  At a meeting duly called and held, Parents Board of Directors has (i)  unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders,  (ii) unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby  and (iii) unanimously resolved (subject to Section 7.05) to recommend that Parents  shareholders grant the Parent Shareholder Approval. 

  Section  4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and performance  by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and  Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in  respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency, official or authority,  domestic, foreign or supranational, or self-regulatory organization or other  similar non-governmental regulatory body (each, a "Governmental Authority"),  other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of  State of the State of Connecticut and appropriate documents with the relevant  authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to do business, (ii)  compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) compliance  with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other  applicable securities laws, whether state or foreign, (iv) compliance with any  applicable requirements of the NYSE, (v) approvals or filings under Insurance  Laws as set forth in Section 4.03 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (vi) consents,  approvals and notices to the extent required under the Investment Company Act  of 1940 (the "1940 Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of  1940 (the "Advisers Act") (such actions and filings listed  in clauses (i) through (vi) above, the "Parent Necessary Consents")  and (vii) any other actions or filings the absence of which would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect. 

 

 Section  4.04 _.

Litigation._ Except as set forth in Parent SEC Documents filed prior  to the date hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding (or  any basis therefor) pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened  against or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present or former  officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person  for whom Parent or any Subsidiary may be liable or any of their respective properties  before any court or arbitrator or before or by any governmental body, agency,  regulator or official, domestic, foreign or supranational (other than insurance  claims litigation arising in the ordinary course for which adequate claims reserves  have been established), that, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance  with the plaintiffs demands, would, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or that in any  manner 

  challenges or seeks to prevent,  enjoin, alter or materially delay the Merger
or any of the other transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 Section  4.17 _. Insurance Matters._ (a) Except as otherwise would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates, and other agreements of  insurance, in effect as of the date hereof (including all applications, supplements,  endorsements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) that  are issued by the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries and any and all marketing materials,  agents agreements, brokers agreements or managing general agents agreements  are, to the extent required under applicable law, on forms approved by applicable  insurance regulatory authorities or which have been filed and not objected to  by such authorities within the period provided for objection, and such forms  comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto and,  as to premium rates established by Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary  which are required to be filed with or approved by insurance regulatory authorities,  the rates have been so filed or approved, the premiums charged conform thereto  in all material respects, and such premiums comply in all material respects  with the insurance statutes, regulations and rules applicable thereto.  

 

 (b)  All reinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements,  to which Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under which  Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations  or liabilities are in full force and effect except for such treaties or agreements  the failure to be in full force and effect as would not, individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Neither Parent nor any Parent Insurance Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of  Parent, any other party to a reinsurance treaty, binder or other agreement to  which Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary is a party, is in default in  any material respect as to any provision thereof and, except as would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect, no such agreement contains any provision providing that the other party  thereto may terminate such agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. Parent has not received any notice to the effect that the  financial condition of any other party to any such agreement is impaired with  the result that a default thereunder may reasonably be anticipated, whether  or not such default may be cured by the operation of any offset clause in such  agreement. The Parent SAP Statements accurately reflect the extent to which,  pursuant to Insurance Laws, Parent and/or the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries  are entitled to take credit for reinsurance. 

 

 (c)  Prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered or made available to the Company  a true and complete copy of all actuarial reports prepared by actuaries, independent  or otherwise, with respect to Parent or any Parent Insurance Subsidiary since  December 31, 2000, and all attachments, addenda, 

  supplements and modifications thereto  (the "Parent Actuarial Analyses"). To
the knowledge of Parent,  the information and data furnished by Parent or any
Parent Insurance Subsidiary  to its independent actuaries in connection with
the preparation of the Parent  Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all
material respects. Furthermore, to the  knowledge of Parent, each Parent
Actuarial Analysis was based upon an accurate  inventory of policies in force
for Parent and the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries,  as the case may be, at the
relevant time of preparation, was prepared using  appropriate modeling
procedures accurately applied and in conformity with generally  accepted
actuarial principles consistently applied, and the projections contained 
therein were properly prepared in accordance with the assumptions stated
therein. 

 

 Section  4.18 _. Liabilities and Reserves._ (a) The reserves carried on the Parent  SAP Statements of each Parent Insurance Subsidiary were, as of the respective  dates of such Parent SAP Statements, in compliance in all material respects  with the requirements for reserves established by the insurance departments  of the state of domicile (or local equivalent) of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary,  were determined in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted  actuarial principles consistently applied, were computed on the basis of methodologies  consistent in all material respects with those used in prior periods, except  as otherwise noted in the Parent SAP Statements, were fairly stated in all material  respects in accordance with sound actuarial and statutory accounting principles  and were established in accordance, in all material respects, with prudent insurance  practices generally followed in the insurance industry. Such reserves make a  reasonable provision for loss and loss adjustment exposure liability in the  aggregate to cover the total amount of all reasonably anticipated liabilities  of Parent and the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries under all outstanding insurance,  reinsurance and other applicable agreements as of the respective dates of such  Parent SAP Statements. Parent has provided or made available to the Company  copies of substantially all work papers used as the basis for establishing the  reserves for Parent and the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31, 2001  and December 31, 2002, respectively. 

 

 (b)  Except for regular periodic assessments in the ordinary course of business or  assessments based on developments which are publicly known within the insurance  industry, to the knowledge of Parent, no claim or assessment is pending or threatened  against any Parent Insurance Subsidiary which is peculiar or unique to such  Parent Insurance Subsidiary by any state insurance guaranty association in connection  with such associations fund relating to insolvent insurers, which, if  determined adversely would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  ARTICLE  5 
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF THE COMPANY

 

 Except  as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, regardless of whether the relevant  Section herein refers to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents  and warrants to Parent that: 

 

 Section  5.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ (a) The Company is a corporation  duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut  and the Company and its Subsidiaries have all corporate, partnership or other  similar powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents,  franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals required to carry on  their business as now conducted (the "Company Permits"), except  for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents, franchises, variances,  exemptions, orders and approvals the absence of which would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of  the Company Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or  in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation  and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,  except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. The Company has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent true  and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company  as currently in effect. 

 

 (b)  As used in this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect"  means (i) a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),  properties, business, results of the operations or prospects of the Company  and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than effects caused by changes  in general economic or securities markets conditions, changes that affect the  businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate in general and  which do not have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its  Subsidiaries, and changes resulting from the announcement or proposed consummation  of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) a material  impairment of the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated  in this Agreement. 

 

 Section  5.02 _. Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and performance  by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the  transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys corporate powers  and, except for the Company Shareholder Approval, have been duly authorized  by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. This Agreement  has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and 

  constitutes a valid and binding  agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with  its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws relating to or affecting creditors  generally or by general equity
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The only votes of the holders  of any class
or series of capital stock of the Company necessary in connection  with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated  by this
Agreement are the affirmative vote of (A) the holders of the Company  Common
Stock representing a majority of the votes eligible to be cast by such 
holders, (B) the holders of the Company Class A Common Stock representing a 
majority of the votes eligible to be cast by such holders and (C) the
holders  of the Company Class B Common Stock representing a majority of the

The Company SAP Statements were and will be prepared in conformity with  SAP consistently applied for the periods covered thereby, were and will be prepared  in accordance with the books and records of the Company or the applicable Company  Insurance Subsidiary, as the case may be, and present the statutory financial  position of such 

  Company Insurance Subsidiaries  as at the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations of such Subsidiaries  for the respective periods then
ended. The Company SAP Statements complied,  and will comply, in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and  regulations when filed, and no
material deficiency has been asserted with respect  to any Company SAP
Statements by the applicable insurance regulatory body or  any other
governmental agency or body. Except as indicated therein, all assets  that
are reflected on the Company SAP Statements comply in all material respects 
with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local statutes and

applicable Insurance  Laws with respect to admitted assets and are in an
amount at least equal to  the minimum amounts required by Insurance Laws. The

Law, audited by an independent accounting  firm of recognized national or
international reputation where required under  applicable Insurance Laws, and
the Company has delivered or made available to  Parent true and complete

(a) The business and operations  of the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries have been conducted in  compliance with all applicable Insurance Laws, except where the failure to so  conduct such business and operations would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding  the generality of the foregoing, except where the failure to do so would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect, each Company Insurance Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the  Company, its agents, have marketed, sold and issued insurance products in compliance,  in all material respects, with Insurance Laws applicable to the business of  such Company Insurance Subsidiary and in the respective jurisdictions in which  such products have been sold. In addition, (x) there is no pending or, to the  knowledge of the Company, threatened charge by any Governmental Authorities  that any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has violated, nor any pending  or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened investigation by any Governmental  Authorities with respect to possible violations 

  of, any applicable Insurance Laws  where such violations would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and (y) the Company Insurance  Subsidiaries have filed all
reports required to be filed with any insurance  regulatory authority on or

applicability and the insurance licenses maintained by the Company  Insurance
Subsidiaries, or disclosed on Section 5.14(a) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule there are no written agreements, memoranda of understanding,
commitment  letters or similar undertakings binding on the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries  to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, on
one hand, and  any Governmental Authority is a party or addressee, on the
other hand, or orders  or directives by, or supervisory letters from, any
Governmental Authority specifically  with respect to the Company or any of

any of its Insurance  Subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise restrict the
conduct of business  of the Company or any of its Insurance Subsidiaries in
any material respect. 

 

 (b)  None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge, any  person "associated" (as defined under the Advisers Act) with the Company  or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, has during the five years prior to  the date hereof been convicted of any crime or been subject to any disqualification  that would be a basis for denial, suspension or revocation of registration of  an investment adviser under Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act or Rule 206(4)-4(b)  thereunder or of a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the 1934 Act, or for disqualification  as an investment adviser for any registered Investment Company pursuant to Section  9(a) of the 1940 Act. 

 

 (c)  In addition to Insurance Laws, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and  has been in compliance with, and to the knowledge of the Company is not under  investigation with respect to, and has not been threatened to be charged with  or given notice of any violation of, any applicable Laws, except for failures  to comply or violations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected  to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  

  Section  5.15 _. Litigation._ Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed  prior to the date hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding  (or any basis therefor) pending against, or, to the knowledge of the Company,  threatened against or affecting, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any present  or former officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or any Person for whom the Company or any Subsidiary may be liable or any of  their respective properties before any court or arbitrator or before or by any  governmental body, agency, regulator or official, domestic, foreign or supranational  (other than insurance claims litigation arising in the ordinary course for which  adequate claims reserves have been established), that, if determined or resolved  adversely in accordance with the plaintiffs demands, would, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect or that in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or  materially delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.  

 

 Section  5.16 _. Insurance Matters._ (a) Except as otherwise would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates, and other agreements of  insurance, in effect as of the date hereof (including all applications, supplements,  endorsements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) that  are issued by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries and any and all marketing materials,  agents agreements, brokers agreements or managing general agents agreements  are, to the extent required under applicable law, on forms approved by applicable  insurance regulatory authorities or which have been filed and not objected to  by such authorities within the period provided for objection, and such forms  comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto and,  as to premium rates established by the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary  which are required to be filed with or approved by insurance regulatory authorities,  the rates have been so filed or approved, the premiums charged conform thereto  in all material respects, and such premiums comply in all material respects  with the insurance statutes, regulations and rules applicable thereto.  

 

 (b)  All reinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements,  to which the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under  which the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights,  obligations or liabilities are in full force and effect except for such treaties  or agreements the failure to be in full force and effect as would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Insurance Subsidiary, nor, to the  knowledge of the Company, any other party to a reinsurance treaty, binder or  other agreement to which the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary is  a party, is in default in any material respect as to any provision thereof and,  except as would not, individually or in the 

  aggregate, reasonably be expected  to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
no such agreement contains any provision  providing that the other party
thereto may terminate such agreement by reason  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has not received  any notice to
the effect that the financial condition of any other party to  any such
agreement is impaired with the result that a default thereunder may 
reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be cured by the
operation  of any offset clause in such agreement. The Company SAP Statements
accurately  reflect the extent to which, pursuant to Insurance Laws, the
Company and/or  the Company Insurance Subsidiaries are entitled to take
credit for reinsurance. 

 

 (c)  Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent  a true and complete copy of all actuarial reports prepared by actuaries, independent  or otherwise, with respect to the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary  since December 31, 2000, and all attachments, addenda, supplements and modifications  thereto (the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). To the knowledge  of the Company, any information and data furnished by the Company or any Company  Insurance Subsidiary to independent actuaries in connection with the preparation  of the Company Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects. Furthermore,  to the knowledge of the Company, each Company Actuarial Analysis was based upon  an accurate inventory of policies in force for the Company and the Company Insurance  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant time of preparation, was prepared  using appropriate modeling procedures accurately applied and in conformity with  generally accepted actuarial principles consistently applied, and the projections  contained therein were properly prepared in accordance with the assumptions  stated therein. 

 

 Section  5.17 _. Liabilities and Reserves._ (a) The reserves carried on the Company  SAP Statements of each Company Insurance Subsidiary were, as of the respective  dates of such Company SAP Statements, in compliance in all material respects  with the requirements for reserves established by the insurance departments  of the state of domicile (or local equivalent) of such Company Insurance Subsidiary,  were determined in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted  actuarial principles consistently applied, were computed on the basis of methodologies  consistent in all material respects with those used in prior periods, except  as otherwise noted in the Company SAP Statements, were fairly stated in all  material respects in accordance with sound actuarial and statutory accounting  principles and were established in accordance, in all material respects, with  prudent insurance practices generally followed in the insurance industry. Such  reserves make a reasonable provision for loss and loss adjustment exposure liability  in the aggregate to cover the total amount of all reasonably anticipated liabilities  of the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries under all outstanding  insurance, reinsurance and other applicable agreements as of the respective  dates of such Company SAP Statements. The Company has provided

reference) shall be made without the approval of  both Parent and the
Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed;

Registration  Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such
documents would not  include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact  necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under  which they were made, not misleading, the party
hereto discovering such information  shall promptly notify the other parties

 (c)  The Board of Directors of an Applicable Party shall not take any of the actions  referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless the  Applicable Party shall have delivered to the other party a prior written notice  advising the other party that it intends to take such action, and the Applicable  Party shall continue to advise the other party after taking such action; _provided_   that, in the case of an action referred to in clause (iii) of the preceding  subsection, the Applicable Party shall have delivered written notice to the  other party at least ten Business Days in advance of taking such action (unless  at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are fewer than  ten Business Days prior to the Applicable Partys Shareholder Meeting or  the ten-Business-Day period would make impractical compliance with Rule 14e-2(a)  or Rule 14d-9, in which case the Applicable Party shall provide as much notice  in advance of the Applicable Partys shareholder meeting or the filing  of a Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, as is reasonably practicable) and during  such interim period it shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its financial  and legal advisors to negotiate, with the other party in good faith to make  such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the  Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. In addition,  the Applicable Party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event  later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Applicable Party (or any of its advisors)  of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is considering  making an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for non-public information  relating to the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to  the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Applicable Party or  any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or  has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Applicable Party shall provide such notice  orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms  and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The  Applicable Party shall promptly provide the other party with any non-public  information concerning the Applicable Partys business, present or future  performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to any Third  Party that was not previously provided to the other party. The Applicable Party  shall keep the other party fully informed, on a prompt basis (but in no event  later than 24 hours), of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,  indication or request. The Applicable Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  and the advisors, employees and other agents of the Applicable Party and any  of its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and  all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third  Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition  

  Proposal and shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause any such Third
Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession  of confidential information
about the Applicable Party that was furnished by  or on behalf of the
Applicable Party to return or destroy all such information. 

 

 "Superior  Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal  for shares of capital stock of the Applicable Party representing at least a  majority of the outstanding voting power of the Applicable Party on terms that  the Board of Directors of the Applicable Party determines in good faith by a  majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal  counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition  Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, Tax  treatment, regulatory aspects and conditions to consummation, are more favorable  to all the Applicable Partys shareholders, from a financial point of view,  than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the terms, if  any, proposed by the other party to amend or modify the terms of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement) and for which financing, to the extent required,  is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board  of Directors of the Applicable Party. 

 

 (d)  Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall (x) permit Parent or the Company to terminate  this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article 9) or (y) affect  or limit any other obligation of Parent or the Company under this Agreement  (including the provisions of Section 7.01). Except as required by law or its  certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, neither Parent nor the Company  shall submit any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger and the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to a vote of its shareholders prior to termination  of this Agreement. 

 

 Section  7.06 _. Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _(a)  Following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to  the extent permitted by law, (i) jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless,  and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers  and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities)  (A) to the same extent such individuals are indemnified or have the right to  advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant  to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and indemnification  agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with, or for the benefit  of, any directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  and (B) without limitation to subclause (A) above, to the fullest extent permitted  by law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval  of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),  (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the certificate of incorporation  and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (or any 

  successor to the Surviving Corporation)  for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination  of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees  and advancement of
expenses that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous  to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in  the current
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and (iii) cause to be maintained  for
a period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors  and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance with  one or more reputable unaffiliated third-party insurers
maintained by the Company  ( _provided_ that Parent (or any successor
thereto) may substitute therefor  one or more policies with one or more
reputable unaffiliated third-party insurers  of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that  are, in the aggregate, no
less advantageous to the insured) with respect to  claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective  Time; _provided, however_
, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation  be required to expend in
any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual  premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance if the Board of Directors  of Parent
as constituted after the Effective Time shall have so determined;  and,
_provided further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage 
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with at 
least the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 
Notwithstanding any foregoing provision to the contrary, the treatment of
past  and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  with respect to elimination of liability, indemnification,
advancement of expenses  and liability insurance under this Section 7.06
shall be, in the aggregate,  no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the corresponding  treatment of the past and
present directors, officers and employees of Parent  and its Subsidiaries
under Section 7.06(b).

 

 (b)  The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.06  shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect  any indemnitee to whom this Section 7.06 applies without the consent of such  affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom  this Section 7.06 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section  7.06). 

 

 Section  7.07 _. Employee Benefits._ (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company  Employee Plans and Company International Plans in effect as of the date of this  Agreement and at the Effective Time shall remain in effect with respect to the  current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company  Employees") covered by such plans at the Effective Time, until such  time as Parent and the Company shall otherwise determine, subject to applicable  laws and the terms of such plans. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in  reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the Parent Employee Plans, the Parent International  Plans, the Company Employee Plans and the Company International Plans (collectively,  the "Existing Plans") with a view towards 

  developing appropriate Employee  Plans for all employees of Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries;  _provided_ that the Employee
Plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall  be maintained substantially as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective  Time through the end of the 2004
plan year for such Employee Plan, or if such  Employee Plan has no plan year,
December 31, 2004. It is the intention of Parent  and the Company, to the
extent permitted by applicable laws, for Parent and  the Company to develop
Employee Plans, as soon as reasonably practicable after  the Effective Time,
which, among other things, (i) treat similarly situated  employees on a
substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant  factors,
including duties, geographic location, line of business, tenure,
qualifications  and abilities and (ii) do not discriminate between employees
who were covered  by Parent Employee Plans or Parent International Plans, on
the one hand, and  employees covered by Company Employee Plans or Company
International Plans on  the other, at the Effective Time. Nothing herein
shall prohibit any changes  to the Existing Plans that may be (x) required by
applicable laws (including  any applicable qualification requirements of
Section 401(a) of the Code), (y)  necessary as a technical matter to reflect
the transactions contemplated hereby  or (z) required for Parent to provide
for or permit investment in its securities.  Subject to the proviso contained
in the second sentence of this Section 7.07(a),  nothing in this Section 7.07
shall be interpreted as preventing Parent or the  Company from amending,
modifying or terminating any Existing Plan or other contract,  arrangement,
commitment or understanding, in accordance with its terms and applicable 
laws.

 

 (b)  With respect to any Employee Plan in which any Company Employee  first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in  which such Company Employee did not participate prior to the Effective Time  (a "New Plan"), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,  exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements  applicable to such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents under  such New Plan, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions  or waiting periods applied immediately prior thereto under the analogous Company  Employee Plan or Company International Plan; (ii) provide such Company Employee  and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles  paid prior to becoming eligible to participate in such New Plan under an analogous  Company Employee Plan or Company International Plan (to the same extent that  such credit was given under such Company Employee Plan) in satisfying any applicable  deductible or annual maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such New Plan;  and (iii) recognize all service of such Company Employee with the Company, and  its Subsidiaries and predecessors, for all purposes (except with respect to  any defined benefit pension plan, benefit accrual) in such New Plan, to the  extent that such service was recognized for such purpose under the analogous  Company Employee Plan or Company International Plan; _provided_ that the  foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication of  benefits. 

  (c)  The provisions in any Company Employee Plan or Company International Plan providing  for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company (including  any stock-based compensation awards) shall be amended, effective as of the Effective  Time, to provide for the issuance, transfer or grant of capital stock of Parent,  and each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that, following the Effective  Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award or any  participant in any Company Employee Plan or Company International Plan shall  have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any stock-based  compensation awards) of the Company. 

 

 (d)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take or cause to be  taken all actions necessary to amend any benefit equalization trust, rabbi trust,  voluntary employees benefits association or similar funding vehicle and  any related Parent Employee Plan or Parent International Plan or a Company Employee  Plan or Company International Plan, as the case may be, effective prior to or  as of the Effective Time, such that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (whether alone or in connection with other events) will not result in the acceleration,  increase or provision of any rights or benefits to any current or former director,  employee or independent contractor under such funding vehicle, including any  additional funding obligation thereunder. 

 

 Section  7.08 _. Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall use reasonable  best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use  reasonable best efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public  statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent  with such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable  Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any  securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release  or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect  to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the  foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy  Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.01, neither Parent  nor the Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement  or disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys business,  financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other  party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  

 

 Section  7.09 _. Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock._ Parent shall use its  best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the  Merger and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon  exercise of the Parent Stock Options (following the Merger) to be approved for  listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective  Time. 

  Section  7.10 _. Rights Agreements._ The Board of Directors of the Company has taken  all action to the extent necessary (including amending the Company Rights Agreement)  in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except in connection with the foregoing  sentence and to effect its obligations under this Agreement, the Board of Directors  of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) amend  the Company Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action with respect to, or make  any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, including a redemption  of the Company Rights, in each case in order to facilitate any Acquisition Proposal  with respect to the Company. 

 

 Section  7.11 _. Affiliates._ Promptly following the date of mailing of the Joint  Proxy Statement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all  Persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may be deemed at the time this  Agreement is submitted for the Company Shareholder Approval, "affiliates"  of Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933 Act and applicable SEC rules  and regulations, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes  from the date thereof. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause  each Person identified on such list to deliver to Parent not later than ten  days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially in the form  attached as Exhibit C hereto. 

 

 Section  7.12 _. Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the  Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions  of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company  Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities  with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated  by Article 2 or Article 3 by each individual who is subject to the reporting  requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company or  will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to  be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act. 

 

 Section  7.13 _. Dividends._ After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and  the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends  in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates  and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto  that holders of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall not receive  two dividend distributions, or fail to receive one full dividend distribution,  for any single calendar quarter, including the quarter in which the Effective  Time occurs, with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares  of Parent Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the  Merger; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the  contrary, it is the intention of the parties that Parent will declare to the  holders of Parent Common Stock as of a record date or dates prior to the Effective  Time 

  and pay one or more special dividends  of cash or obligations to pay cash in
an amount sufficient to result in such  holders receiving in respect of their
Parent Common Stock aggregate dividends  with record dates during 2004 of
$1.16 per share (appropriately adjusted to  reflect any stock dividends,
subdivisions, splits, combinations or other similar  events relating to the
Parent Common Stock), assuming that dividends declared  by Parent after the
Effective Time with record dates in 2004 will be paid at  the quarterly rate
of $0.22 (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, 
subdivisions, splits, combinations or other similar events relating to the
Parent  Common Stock) per share of Parent Common Stock.

 

 Section  7.14 _. Company Convertible Securities._ Parent and the Company shall use  all reasonable efforts to enter into a supplemental indenture prior to the Effective  Time with the trustee under the Company Indenture, to provide that from and  after the Effective Time (i) the Company Convertible Notes will be convertible  only into the Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common  Stock in the Merger and (ii) Parent will become a joint obligor, together with  the Company, with respect to the Company Convertible Notes. 

 

 Section  7.15 _. Limited Disclosure Authorization._ Notwithstanding any other provision  of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the parties (and  each employee, representative or other agent of each of the parties) may disclose  the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (including any materials, opinions or analyses relating to such tax  treatment or tax structure, but without disclosure of identifying information  or, except to the extent relating to such tax structure or tax treatment, any  nonpublic commercial or financial information); _provided_ that any such  information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure shall be kept confidential  to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities  laws. Moreover,  notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Confidentiality  Agreement, there shall be no limitation on each of the parties ability  to consult any tax advisor, whether or not independent from such party or its  Affiliates, regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

 Section  7.16 _. Tax Treatment._ Prior to and at the Effective Time, each party hereto  shall use its best efforts (including by delivering customary representations  required by each partys counsel to render its opinion described in Sections  8.02(c) and 8.03(c)) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take any action  reasonably likely to cause the Merger not so to qualify.

 Section  2. _Regular Annual Meeting_.

name and address, as they appear on the corporations  share register, of the
shareholder proposing such business; (iii)  the class and number of shares of

The St. Paul  Companies, Inc. 
  385 St. Paul Street 
  Saint Paul, MN 55101

 

 Re:  Rule 145 Restrictions 

 

 Ladies and Gentlemen:  

 

  The St. Paul Companies, Inc. a Minnesota corporation ("St. Paul"),
Adams Acquisition Corp., a Connecticut corporation and a wholly-owned first
tier subsidiary of St. Paul ("Merger Sub") and Travelers Property Casualty
Corp., a Connecticut corporation (the "Company"), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 16, 2003 (the "Merger

and into the Company, and each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company would be converted into the right to receive common stock,
without designated par value, of St. Paul ("Shares"). Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the
Merger Agreement.  

 

  The undersigned has been advised that as of the date the Merger is
submitted to stockholders of the Company for approval, the undersigned may be
an "affiliate" of the Company as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules
and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").  

 

  The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to St. Paul that in
the event the undersigned receives any Shares as a result of the Merger:  

 

 A.  At the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the stockholders  of the Company, (a) the undersigned may be deemed to have been an  affiliate of the Company and (b) since the distribution by the undersigned  of the Shares has not been registered under the Act, the undersigned  may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Shares issued to the  undersigned in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other  disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer  or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of  Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act (as such rule  may hereinafter from time to time be amended), or (iii) in the opinion  of   
  

 counsel reasonably acceptable to St. Paul, or in accordance with a "no
action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the Commission,
such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Act.  

 

  B. The undersigned understands that St. Paul is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares by the
undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act.  

 

  C. The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions
will be given to St. Pauls transfer agents with respect to the Shares issued
to the undersigned and that there will be placed on the certificates for the
Shares issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:  

 

>  
>
> "The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction 
> to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933  applies.
> The shares represented by this certificate may only be  transferred in
> accordance with the terms of an agreement dated  , 20 between the
> registered holder hereof and The St. Paul Companies,  Inc., a copy of which
> agreement is on file at the principal offices  of The St. Paul Companies,
> Inc."
>
>  

 

  D. The undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds Shares has been registered under the Act or
is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act,
St. Paul reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates
issued to any transferee of such Shares from the undersigned:  

 

>  
>
> "The  shares represented by this certificate have not been registered 
> under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person  who
> received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated  under
> the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been  acquired by the
> holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection  with, any
> distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities  Act of 1933 and
> may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise  transferred except in
> accordance with an exemption from the registration  requirements of the
> Securities Act of 1933."
>
>  

 

  E. St. Paul agrees that the stop transfer instructions and legends
referred to above shall be terminated or removed if (A) one year shall have
elapsed from the date of the effective time of the Merger and the provisions
of Rule 145(d)(2) under the Act are then available to the undersigned, (B) two
years shall have elapsed from the date of the effective time of the Merger and
the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act are then available to the
undersigned or (C) the undersigned shall have delivered to St. Paul a copy of
a letter from the  

 

 2     
 

staff  of the SEC or an opinion of counsel with recognized expertise in 
securities law matters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory  to St.
Paul, to the effect that such instructions and legends are  not required for
the purposes of the Act.

 

 F.  The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Agreement  and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon  the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose  of Shares, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary, with counsel  of the undersigned or counsel for the Company. 

 

 By  its acceptance hereof, St. Paul agrees, for a period of two years  after the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), that it,  as the surviving corporation, will file on a timely basis all reports  required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information  provisions of Rule 144(c) under the Act are satisfied and the resale  provisions of Rules 145(d)(1) and (2) under the Act are therefore  available to the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires  to transfer any Shares issued to the undersigned in the Merger.  

 

      Very  truly yours,
