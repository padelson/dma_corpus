pursuant to the Mergers and the terms of this Agreement and subject to

Parent\'s fiscal month in which the Closing Date occurs (the "CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET DATE"), a copy of which shall be delivered to Parent and Arthur
Andersen ("ARTHUR ANDERSEN"). For all purposes relating to the calculation of
the Working Capital Adjustment, from the Closing Date to the Closing Balance
Sheet Date, the business of the Beverage Companies shall be operated and the
treatment of Working Capital components shall each be in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice prior to the Closing Date or, if
not, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the actual results for the
purpose of the calculation.   (ii) Within 45 days after receipt
thereof, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be audited by Arthur Andersen (the
"AUDITED CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") and such firm shall deliver an audit opinion
stating that the Audited Closing Balance Sheet presents fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Beverage Companies on a
consolidated basis as of the Closing Balance Sheet Date in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied with the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet
of the Beverage Companies as of January 2, 2000. The Audited Closing Balance
Sheet shall be provided to Parent promptly upon the availability thereof. In

Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Adjustment Certificate. Arthur Andersen
shall provide access to the work papers used to prepare, audit and review the
Audited Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Adjustment Certificate to Parent
and its professional advisors. If Parent objects to all or any part of the
Audited Closing Balance Sheet or the Final Adjustment Certificate, Parent
shall so notify CS in writing (each such notice, a "DISAGREEMENT NOTICE") on
or before the last day of the Review Period, setting forth a description of
such party\'s objection and the amount of the adjustment which such party
believes should be made to each item of its objection. If no Disagreement
Notices are delivered within the Review Period, the Audited Closing Balance
Sheet and the Final Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Parent and CS.   (iv) DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   (A) In the event
that any Disagreement Notice is delivered in accordance with Section
2.2(d)(ii), CS and Parent shall attempt to resolve the objections set forth
therein within 30 days of receipt of such Disagreement Notice. The objections
set forth in the Disagreement Notice that are resolved by CS and Parent in
accordance with this Section 2.2(c)(iv) shall collectively be referred to
herein as the "RESOLVED OBJECTIONS." The Final Adjustment Certificate shall
be adjusted to reflect any Resolved Objections.   (B) If CS and Parent are
unable to resolve all the objections set forth in any Disagreement Notice
within such thirty (30) day period, the following procedure for dispute
resolution shall apply:   (i) Within 15 days of the end of such thirty
(30) day period, the parties shall jointly appoint the Independent Accounting
Firm to assist in the resolution of the outstanding objections;   (ii) Upon

Independent Accounting Firm shall review the objections set forth in the
Disagreement Notice or Notices that are not Resolved Objections
(collectively, the "DIFFERENCES") and the written submissions, if any, and
shall determine, based on the requirements set forth in this Section 2.2, and
only with respect to Differences submitted, whether and to what extent the
Audited Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Final Adjustment Certificate require
adjustment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall any determination by
the Independent Accounting Firm of any Difference result in an adjustment
greater than the amount of the adjustment requested with respect to such
Difference in the Disagreement Notice or Notices;   (v) The
Independent Accounting Firm shall have the discretion to determine whether to
convene a meeting or meetings of the parties to assist in the resolution of
the Differences;   (vi) CS and Parent shall each pay 50% of the fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm. CS and Parent shall, and CS
shall cause the Beverage Companies to, provide to the Independent Accounting

resolution of the Differences shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties. The Differences as resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, in
accordance with this Section 2.2(c)(iv) shall be referred to
herein collectively as the "DETERMINED DIFFERENCES". The Final Adjustment
Certificate shall be adjusted to reflect any Determined Differences.   (v)
CALCULATION OF FINAL MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENTS.   (A) If the amount
of Working Capital set forth in the Final Adjustment Certificate is greater
by more than 5% than the amount of the Minimum Required Working Capital, then
Parent shall be entitled to receive from CS the amount of the excess (above
5%) of the Working Capital set forth in the Final Adjustment Certificate OVER
the Minimum Required Working Capital (the "FINAL MERGING COMPANIES\' WORKING
CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT").   (B) If the amount of Working Capital set forth in
the Final Adjustment Certificate is less by more than 5% than the amount of
the Minimum Required Working Capital, then CS shall be entitled to receive
from Parent the amount of the difference between (i) the Minimum Required
Working Capital minus 5% of the Minimum Required Working Capital and (ii) the

WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT").   (vi) PAYMENT OF MERGER

of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to own and operate its assets
and properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Parent
and each Beverage Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets

consists of 2,000,000 shares of SBG Common Stock and 400,000 shares of

be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for equity interests of
any Beverage Company). The Beverage Companies contain all of the material
beverage business and operations of Merging Companies and Parent. There are

all other information concerning the Beverage Companies that is available to
Parent as CS may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall cause the Beverage Companies to permit CS and its representatives
access to the real properties owned or leased by any Beverage Company for the
purpose of conducting phase I environmental reviews of such properties, as
reasonably acceptable to Parent. In connection with such access, CS\'s
representatives shall cooperate with Parent\'s representatives and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption of the Beverage
Companies. CS agrees to abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to such access and any information furnished to it or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.2.   5.3 COOPERATION. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, CS and
Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from

any Governmental Authority, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or
reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, CS
shall not be required to consent to the divestiture or other disposition of
any of its or its Affiliates\' assets (including the Shares or any of the
assets of any Beverage Company but excluding the shares or assets of any of
the Beverage Companies international businesses), PROVIDED, FURTHER, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions of Merging Companies and CS with
respect to filings, approvals and other matters pursuant to the HSR Act and
Other Antitrust Regulations shall be governed by Section 5.4.   5.4
ANTITRUST NOTIFICATION. (a) Parent and CS shall, as promptly as practicable
and before the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, file with (i) the FTC and the DOJ, the notification and
report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the

furnish to each other\'s counsel such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and Other Antitrust
Regulations.   (b) Parent and CS shall use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to promptly obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act and
Other Antitrust Regulations for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and other
Governmental Authorities and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that CS shall not be required to consent to the
divestiture or other disposition of any of its or its Affiliates\' assets
(including the Shares or any of the assets of any Beverage Company, but
excluding the shares or assets of any of the Beverage Companies\'
international businesses).   (c) The parties hereto commit to instruct
their respective counsel to cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any
such issues and, consequently, expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting

regular and frequent basis with CS, report on operational matters and
promptly notify CS of, and furnish CS with, any information it may reasonably
request with respect to any event or condition or the existence of any fact
that would cause any of the conditions to CS\'s obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be completed, and CS shall
promptly notify Parent of, and furnish Parent with, any information it may
reasonably request with respect to any event or condition or the existence of
any fact that would cause any of the conditions to Parent\'s obligation to

Date, Parent, on the one hand, and CS, on the other hand, shall promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents reasonably
requested by CS or Parent, as the case may be, and necessary for it to
satisfy its respective obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits
contemplated hereby.   5.7 ANNOUNCEMENTS. Prior to the Closing, neither
Parent nor CS will issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and any of the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) after having had
a reasonable time to review such press release or statement, except as
expressly permitted by and in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The parties agree that the initial press releases
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.   5.8 PRESERVATION
OF RECORDS. Subject to Section 8.5, CS agrees that it shall, at its own
expense, preserve and keep the records held by it relating to the businesses
of the Beverage Companies that could reasonably be required after the Closing
by Parent for the longer of six (6) years after the Closing Date or the
applicable statute of limitations. In addition, CS shall make such records
available to Parent as may be reasonably required by Parent for legitimate
business reasons, such as, but not limited to, the preparation of Tax Returns
or the defense of litigation or other proceedings. Except as may be required
in connection with such legitimate business purpose, Parent will hold in
confidence all confidential information identified as such by, and
obtained from, CS pursuant to this Section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
information which (i) was in the public domain, (ii) was in fact known to
Parent prior to disclosure by CS, or (iii) becomes known to Parent from or
through a third party not under an obligation of non- disclosure to CS shall
not be deemed to be confidential information; and PROVIDED FURTHER that
Parent may disclose any such confidential information to any legal or
financial advisor provided such advisor is advised of the terms of this
Section 5.8.   5.9 RELATED PARTY PAYMENTS. Except as set forth in Section
5.9 of the Disclosure Schedule and except as required under supply
agreements requiring reimbursement of Parent for raw material purchases
identified in Section 5.9 of the Disclosure Schedule and, except as set forth
in Section 5.10, all liabilities and obligations of the Beverage Companies to
Parent and its Affiliates shall be paid or otherwise settled prior to the
Closing. Parent shall, at the Closing, assign to the Beverage Companies raw
material Contracts relating to the business of the Beverage Companies, and CS
shall cause the Beverage Companies to assume all of the obligations of Parent
thereunder.   5.10 INSURANCE/EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) EMPLOYEES. (i) For
the one-year period commencing on the Closing Date, except as otherwise
provided by any collective bargaining agreement, CS agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporations and the Subsidiaries thereof to provide those persons
employed by the Beverage Companies immediately prior to the Closing,
including those employees on vacation, leave of absence, disability (work-
related or otherwise) or sick leave or layoff (whether or not such employees
return to active employment with the Beverage Companies) (the "EMPLOYEES"),
with employee benefits (other than equity benefits and incentive-based
benefits) that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to those
provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to impose on CS or any of its Subsidiaries
any obligation to continue to employ any Employee or to provide the benefits
referred to herein to an Employee after such person ceases to be employed by
CS or any of its Subsidiaries.   (ii) To the extent that service
is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by CS or any of
its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Employees pursuant to the obligations
of clause (i) above, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit such
Employees for service on or prior to the Closing with the Beverage Companies
in the same manner and to the same extent that prior service is credited for
service rendered by employees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries.   (b)
SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS. The parties agree that any and all costs of severance
relating to any Employees either under any of the Contracts listed in Section
3.13 of the Disclosure Schedule (including, without limitation, any related
litigation costs), or arising by operation of law shall be for CS\'s
account.   (c) 401(K) PLAN. If elected by CS by written notice to Parent
prior to the Closing Date, then as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause assets representing the account balances of all
Employees under the Triarc Companies, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan
(the "TRIARC PLAN"), whether or not vested, to be transferred to a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan established as designated by CS. Such
transfer shall be made in cash or in kind, as determined by CS. If CS fails
to make such election, Parent shall cause all such account balances to be
fully vested as of the Closing Date. CS shall promptly reimburse Parent or
pay to third parties any costs or expenses properly allocable to the Beverage
Companies or overpaid by Parent, with respect to Employees under the Triarc
Plan and whether or not such amounts relate to the period before or after the
Closing.   (d) INDEMNIFICATION AND DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' LIABILITY
INSURANCE. (i) The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporations and each of the Beverage Companies shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of SBG and RC, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were covered by such
provisions unless such modification shall be required by law.   (ii) After
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporations shall indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and
agent of the Beverage Companies (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS")
against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, claims,
actions, judgments, causes of action, assessments, out of pocket costs or
expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable
attorney\'s fees and disbursements) (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any
action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent, whether occurring before or after the Effective Time, for
a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the extent that such
person was entitled to such protection as of the date hereof.   (iii) The
Surviving Corporations shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect for six years from the Effective Time (without any gaps or lapses in
coverage), if available, directors\' and officers\' liability and fiduciary
and employment practice insurance policies with at least the same coverage
and containing terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable)
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, PROVIDED, THAT
the Surviving Corporations shall not be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 5.10(d) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by or on behalf of the Beverage Companies in order to
maintain such policies (which premiums Parent represents and warrants to be
approximately $650,000 in the aggregate) or comparable policies and in the
event that the cost of such coverage shall exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporations shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.  
(iv) In the event that either Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (2) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.10(d).   (v) Payments by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Section 5.10(d) shall be limited to the amount of any losses that remain
after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment reasonably recoverable by
the Indemnified Person or any Affiliate thereof from any third party with
respect thereto.   (vi) Any party that proposes to assert the right to be
indemnified under this Section 5.10(d) will, promptly after receipt of notice
of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim
is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this
Section 5.10(d), notify the indemnifying party of the commencement of such
action, enclosing a copy of all the papers served, but the omission so to
notify promptly the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party under the provisions of this
Section 5.10(d) unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in
the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party or
otherwise materially adversely affects the ability of the indemnifying party
to defend against or diminish the losses arising out of such claim, action or
proceeding. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and
it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying
party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by
delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving
notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party to assume
the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other
expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of
investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own
counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such
counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing
by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has
reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party who
is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party) that there may be legal
defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from
or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) a conflict
or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified
party, who is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party) between
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party who has assumed the defense of any claim or action
pursuant to this Section 5.10(d) will not have the right to direct the
defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iv) the
indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the
indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party
or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable
fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted
to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified
party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be
reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred. Any
indemnifying party who has assumed the defense of any claim or action
pursuant to this Section 5.10(d) will not be liable for any settlement of any
action or claim effected without its prior written consent. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of any claim or action pursuant to
this Section 5.10(d), the indemnified party shall make available to the
indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control
that are reasonably necessary for such defense.   (vii) The obligations of
the Surviving Corporations under this Section 5.10(d) shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 5.10(d) applies without the consent of each affected
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to
whom this Section 5.10(d) applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.10(d)).   (viii) In the event that the Surviving Corporations
should fail, at any time from and after the Closing Date, to comply with any
of the foregoing obligations set forth in this Section 5.10(d), for
any reason, CS shall be responsible therefor and hereby agrees to perform
such obligations unconditionally without regard to any defense or other basis
for nonperformance which the Surviving Corporations may have or claim (except
as would be prohibited by applicable law), it being the intention of
this subsection (viii) that the Indemnified Persons shall be fully
indemnified to the extent provided in this Section 5.10(d) and that the
provisions of this subsection (viii) be a primary obligation of CS and not
merely a guarantee by CS of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporations.   (e) INSURANCE. (i) Parent, Merging Companies and CS agree
that Casualty Insurance Claims relating to the Beverage Companies (including
reported claims and including incurred but not reported claims) will remain
with the Beverage Companies immediately following the Closing. For purposes
hereof, "CASUALTY INSURANCE CLAIMS" shall mean workers\' compensation, auto
liability, general liability and products liability claims,
fiduciary coverage and employment practices coverage and all related expenses
to the extent not covered by insurance, including, but not limited to,
claims, retentions, loss sensitive adjustments, audits and third party
administrative adjustments. The Casualty Insurance Claims are subject to the
provisions of policies of insurance with insurance carriers and contractual
arrangements with insurance adjusters maintained by Parent or Merging
Companies prior to the Closing (collectively, the "INSURANCE POLICIES"). With
respect to the Casualty Insurance Claims, the following procedures shall
apply: (i) Parent shall continue to administer, adjust, settle and pay, on
behalf of the Beverage Companies, all Casualty Insurance Claims with dates of
occurrence prior to the date of closing; PROVIDED, that Parent will obtain
the consent of CS prior to adjusting, settling or paying any Casualty
Insurance Claim of an amount greater than $30,000; and (ii) Parent shall
invoice the Beverage Companies at the end of each month for Casualty
Insurance Claims paid on behalf of the Beverage Companies by Parent or
Parent\'s insurance company or insurance adjuster during the previous month.
CS shall cause the Beverage Companies to pay Parent within 15 days of the
date of each monthly invoice. In the event that the Beverage Companies do not
pay Parent within 15 days of such invoice, interest at the rate of 10% per
annum shall accrue on the amount of such invoice. Casualty Insurance Claims
to be paid by the Beverage Companies hereunder shall include all costs
necessary to settle claims including, but not limited to, compensatory,
medical, legal, adjusting fees and other allocated expenses. In the event
that any Casualty Insurance Claim exceeds a deductible or self-insured
retention under the Insurance Policies, and provided that the Beverage
Companies shall have promptly paid any costs related to such Casualty
Insurance Claim, the Beverage Companies shall be entitled to the benefit of
any insurance proceeds that may be available to discharge any portion of such
Casualty Insurance Claim.   (ii) Parent shall not be responsible to CS or
any of its Affiliates for the failure of any insurer to pay under any
such Insurance Policy.   (iii) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
provide or shall be construed as providing a benefit or release to
any insurer or claims service organization of any obligation under any
Insurance Policy. Parent, Merging Companies and CS confirm that the sole
intention of this Section 5.10(f) is to divide and allocate between them the
benefits and obligations under the Insurance Policies as of the Closing Date
and not to affect, enhance or diminish the rights and obligations of any
insurer or claims service organization thereunder. Nothing herein shall be
construed as creating or permitting any insurer or claims service
organization the right of subrogation against Parent, Merging Companies or CS
or any of their Affiliates in respect of payments made by one to the other
under any Insurance Policy.   5.11 ASSUMPTION OF 2018 DEBENTURES.   5.11.1
DELIVERY OF CLASS A SHARES; CHARACTER OF CLASS A SHARES. On the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver to the Custodian under the Custody Agreement, dated as
of the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
(the "CUSTODY AGREEMENT") stock certificates duly executed and in proper form
and registered in blank representing 3,407,400 treasury shares of Class A
Common Stock of Parent, par value $0.10 per share (the "CLASS A SHARES"). The
parties hereto agree that such Class A Shares shall continue to be treasury
shares of Parent until delivered in accordance with the terms of the Custody
Agreement. Until so delivered, no party hereto (other than Parent to the
extent permitted by law) shall have any rights with respect to such shares
including, without limitation, the right to vote such shares or the right to
receive dividends or distributions upon the dissolution, winding-up
or liquidation of Parent.   5.11.2 CONVERSION RATE. (a) The Class A
Shares delivered to the Custodian shall represent the maximum number of
shares of Class A Common Stock into which the 2018 Debentures are convertible
based on a conversion rate of 9.465 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000
aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Debentures at maturity (the
"CONVERSION RATE"). The Conversion Rate is the rate that is currently in
effect with respect to the conversion of 2018 Debentures into shares of Class
A Common Stock.   (b) In the event that Parent shall, directly
or indirectly, take any action (an "ADJUSTMENT EVENT") which results in
or necessitates an adjustment to the Conversion Rate and/or the required
issuance, upon conversion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018
Debentures at maturity or otherwise, of shares of Class A Common Stock
exceeding the number of shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the
Class A Shares including, without limitation, any of the actions described in
Sections 11.06, 11.07, 11.08 and 11.12 of the Parent Indenture, then, no
later than five (5) Business Days after the Adjustment Event, Parent shall
deliver to the Custodian such number of additional shares of Class A Common
Stock, determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture,
including without limitation, Sections 11.06, 11.07, 11.08 or 11.12 of the
Indenture, as is necessary to reflect the Adjustment Event and ensure that
the Custodian has a sufficient number of shares of Class A Common Stock to
deliver to each 2018 Debenture holder the maximum number of shares of Class A
Common Stock into which its 2018 Debentures are convertible.   5.11.3
PRESERVATION OF CONVERSION RIGHTS. To the extent that such actions do not
otherwise conflict with Parent\'s covenants and agreements herein, in the
event that prior to February 9, 2003, Parent (i) effects any reclassification
of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (other than a change in par
value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value),
(ii) enters into any consolidation, merger, business combination with another
corporation or entity or similar transaction as a result of which holders of
Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other
property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for their
Class A Common Stock ("SUBSTITUTE SECURITIES") or (iii) effects any sale or
conveyance of any properties or assets to any other corporation or entity as
a result of which holders of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive Substitute Securities with respect to or in exchange for their Class
A Common Stock, then Parent shall (x) with respect to an event described in
clause (i), ensure that, and with respect to an event described in clause
(ii) or (iii) above, ensure that the agreement relating to such transaction
includes a covenant in favor of both Parent and CS providing that, in each
case to the extent required under the Parent Indenture, assuming for this
purpose that Parent remained subject thereto, each 2018 Debenture
holder shall be entitled to receive, upon any future conversion of the 2018
Debentures held by such holder, the kind and amount of Substitute Securities
that a holder of the number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of
each holder\'s 2018 Debentures immediately prior to such reclassification or
transaction would have received had each holder converted its 2018 Debentures
immediately prior to the reclassification or transaction, and (y) with
respect to any of the events described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above,
execute with the Trustee an amendment to the Supplemental Parent Indenture
providing for the conversion of the 2018 Debentures into the Substitute
Securities.   5.11.4 CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Prior to February 9, 2003, Parent
shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in
full force and effect its corporate existence where the failure to do so
would constitute an Event of Default under the Parent Indenture, assuming for
this purpose that Parent remained subject thereto.   5.11.5 DEFAULTS UNDER
PARENT INDENTURE. (a) Parent represents and warrants that to the Knowledge of
Parent there are no existing defaults or events that, with the passing of
time or notice or both, would become Events of Default (as defined in the
Parent Indenture). Parent shall not take any action prior to the Closing Date
which would result, with the passing of time or notice or both, in an Event
of Default under the Parent Indenture.   (b) No registration statement is
currently in effect with respect to the 2018 Debentures.   5.11.6 EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY OF SUPPLEMENTAL PARENT INDENTURE. Parent agrees to execute and
deliver on the Closing Date a supplemental Parent Indenture by and among CS,
Parent and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Parent Indenture"), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to CS and the Trustee, in order to provide
for the assumption by CS of the obligations of Parent under the Parent
Indenture and the release of Parent from its obligations under the Parent
Indenture and the 2018 Debentures.   5.11.7 TRUSTEE CERTIFICATE. Parent
shall request the Trustee to deliver to CS on the Closing Date a certificate,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to CS and its counsel,
certifying that as of the Closing Date the Trustee has not received notice
that a default has occurred under the Parent Indenture.   5.11.8 OFFICERS\'
CERTIFICATES; OPINION OF COUNSEL TO PARENT. (a) Each of Parent and CS shall
deliver to the Trustee such Officers\' Certificates (as defined in the Parent
Indenture) as the Trustee may reasonably request in connection with the
execution and delivery of the Supplemental Parent Indenture and the
effectuation of the matters contemplated by this Section 5.11.   (b) Each of
Parent and CS shall cause its counsel to deliver to the Trustee on the
Closing Date its opinion addressed to the Trustee, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Trustee, that all conditions precedent to the
execution and delivery of the Supplemental Parent Indenture have been
complied with by their respective clients and that the Supplemental Parent
Indenture complies with Article 5 of the Parent Indenture and, in respect of
the opinion delivered by Parent\'s counsel, that the related consolidation,
merger, conveyance, transfer or lease complies with Article 5 of the Parent
Indenture.   5.11.9 REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Parent and CS shall execute and
deliver prior to the Closing Date a registration rights
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D providing for the
registration of the delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock upon
conversion of the 2018 Debentures (the "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT").  
5.11.10 SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS. It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties
that the covenants of Parent set forth in this Section 5.11 shall survive the
Closing Date until the earlier of (a) such time as there are no 2018

Parent agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of CS, its
directors and officers and any person who controls CS within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, its Affiliates and the successors and assigns of all of
the foregoing persons from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability
or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation but excluding the
repayment of the accreted value of the 2018 Debentures) which any such person
may incur, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises
out of or is based upon (x) the failure of the representations and warranties
of Parent set forth in Section 5.11.2 and 5.11.5 to be true and correct as of
the date hereof and on the Closing Date, (y) any failure to perform or breach
by Parent in any material respect of the covenants described in this Section
5.11 and any failure to perform its obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement or the Custody Agreement, and (z) any impairment of the rights of
any holder of a 2018 Debenture to convert, upon delivery of notice thereof,
its 2018 Debentures, in whole or in part, solely as a result of a blackout
period being in effect under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement
or the failure of the Registration Statement for the Initial Shelf
Registration (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) to be declared
effective on or prior to the Closing Date.   5.11.12 ACTIONS BY CS. (a) CS
agrees to execute and deliver on the Closing Date the Supplemental Parent
Indenture, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Trustee, in order to provide for the assumption by CS of the obligations of
Parent under the Parent Indenture (including those obligations relating to
the delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the 2018
Debentures). CS agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take all such
additional actions as may be necessary and appropriate to (x) assume the
obligations of Parent with respect to the 2018 Debentures (including those
obligations relating to the delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock upon
conversion of the 2018 Debentures) and (y) to obtain the release of Parent in
full from all obligations under, or responsibilities relating to, resulting
from or arising out of the Parent Indenture with respect to the 2018
Debentures; provided that it is understood that the foregoing shall not
relieve Parent from its obligations to CS and its Affiliates hereunder
and under the Custody Agreement relating to the issuance of shares of Class A
Common Stock upon conversions of the 2018 Debentures and Parent\'s
obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement relating to registration
rights with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon 2018
Debenture conversions.   (b) CS agrees to take all actions
reasonably necessary to call for redemption on February 9, 2003 all
outstanding 2018 Debentures and pay the redemption price therefor so that all
of the 2018 Debentures cease to be outstanding from and after such date.  
5.12 ASSUMPTION OF 10-1/4% NOTES.   5.12.1 DEFAULTS UNDER INDENTURE. (a)
Parent represents and warrants that, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
existing defaults or events that, with the passing of time or notice or both,

not take any action prior to Closing which would, with the passing of time or
notice or both, result in an Event of Default under the Indenture.   (b)
Neither Nelson Peltz nor Peter May is a holder of any 10-1/4% Notes and the

Messrs. Peltz and May is no longer in force or effect.   5.12.2 AMENDMENT OF
INDENTURE AND RELATED MATTERS. Parent agrees to cause TCPG to expeditiously

Supplemental Indenture which will provide for, among other things, the (a)

Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Indenture) and the termination of
their respective obligations, including Subsidiary Guarantees (as defined in
the Indenture) (the "Obligor Release") and (b) addition of a parent company

parties that the covenants of Parent set forth in this Section 5.12 shall
survive the Closing Date.   5.12.4 TRUSTEE CERTIFICATE. Parent shall
request the Trustee to deliver to CS on the Closing Date a certificate, in

CERTIFICATE; OPINION OF COUNSEL TO PARENT AND CS. (a) Each of Parent and CS
shall deliver to the Trustee such Officers\' Certificates (as defined in the
10-1/4% Indenture) as the Trustee may reasonably request in connection with

of the matters contemplated by this Section 5.12.   (b) Each of Parent and
CS shall cause its counsel to deliver to the Trustee on the Closing Date its
opinion addressed to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, that all conditions precedent to the execution
and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture have been complied with by their
respective clients and that the Supplemental Indenture complies with the
10-1/4% Indenture and, in respect of the opinion delivered by Parent\'s
counsel, that the related consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the
10-1/4% Indenture.   5.12.6 ACTIONS BY CS. CS agrees to execute and deliver
on or before the Closing Date the Supplemental Indenture, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Trustee, in order to
provide for the assumption by CS of the obligations of TCPG under the 10-1/4%
Indenture and to cause the Supplemental Indenture to be qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, if required. CS agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take all such additional actions as may be necessary and
appropriate to (x) assume the obligations of Merging Companies under the
10-1/4% Indenture and the 10-1/4% Notes and (y) to obtain the release of
TCPG, AI and all of the Subsidiaries of AI that are Subsidiary Guarantors in

harmless each of CS, its directors and officers and any person who controls
CS within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, its Affiliates, and the
successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons from and against any
loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost
of investigation but excluding the repayment of the principal amount of,
accrued interest on or any applicable premium on the 10-1/4% Notes) which any
such person may incur, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or
claim arises out of or is based upon (x) the failure of the representations
and warranties of Parent set forth in Section 5.12.1 to be true and correct
as of the date hereof and on the Closing Date, and (y) any failure to perform
or breach by Parent in any material respect of the covenants described in
this Section 5.12.   5.13 NO SOLICITATION. (a) Parent will not, nor will
Parent permit any of its Affiliates or their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives and agents (each a "REPRESENTATIVE"), directly or
indirectly, to (i) solicit, seek, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or take any other action to facilitate the
submission of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would be reasonably likely to constitute or lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations (including by way of
furnishing information), or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any Person
to submit or otherwise act in furtherance of, an Acquisition Proposal;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit
Parent or any Representative from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited
written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal on or after the date hereof that the
board of directors of Parent concludes in good faith (after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel)
(1) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal, and (2) would, if consummated, result
in a transaction more favorable to Parent and its stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to herein as a
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") if, prior to taking such action, Parent (x) provides
reasonable notice to CS to the effect that they are taking such action, and
(y) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in
reasonably customary form.   (b) At any time after 48 hours
following notification to CS of Parent\'s intent to do so (which notification
shall include the identity of the bidder and the material terms and
conditions of the proposal) and if Parent has otherwise complied with the
terms of this Section, the board of directors of Parent may cause Merging
Companies to terminate this Agreement and cause Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to enter into any agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, provided Merging Companies shall pay or cause to be paid
to CS the Termination Fee. If Merging Companies shall have notified CS of the
intent to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
compliance with the preceding sentence and have otherwise complied with such
sentence, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may enter into an agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (with the bidder and on terms no less
favorable than those specified in such notification to CS) after the
expiration of such 48- hour period.   (c) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means any
written proposal or offer from any Person relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of (i) 95% or more of the assets, net income or net
revenues of the Beverage Companies, taken as a whole, or (ii) 100% of the
equity securities of SBG or 100% of the equity securities of Parent
(including by way of a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of equity
securities of Parent), or any merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving Parent or SBG (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).   5.14 PAYMENTS FOR OPTIONS. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall take such actions as may be necessary so that (i) each
stock option outstanding under the Option Plan immediately prior to the
Closing (the "OPTIONS") is fully vested simultaneously with the Closing, (ii)
unless exercised by midnight of the second Business Day following the
Closing, shall terminate and (iii) a person exercising any Option after the
Closing shall receive a cash payment from SBG in respect thereof, payable
immediately following such exercise, equal to the amount set forth in respect
of such Option on Section 5.14 of the Disclosure Schedule (as to each Option,
the "OPTION PAYMENT"), less applicable tax withholdings. Payment shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank accounts or
bank account specified by each holder of Options in their notice of exercise
of Options. The amount of any Option Payment listed in Section 5.14 of the
Disclosure Schedule may be changed and the number of Options outstanding may
be increased by up to 2,717 Options (subject to the 150,000 share limitation
contained in the Option Plan) at the sole discretion of Parent at any time
prior to the Closing upon written notice to CS provided at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, provided that any increase in the
amount of any Option Payment will reduce the number set forth in clause (i)
of the first sentence of Section 2.2(a) and the first number set forth in the
second sentence of Section 2.2(a) by the amount of such increase, and
any reduction in the Option Payment will increase the number set forth in
clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 2.2(a) and the first number set
forth in the second sentence of Section 2.2(a) by the amount of such
reduction. In the event that a holder of an Option which is vested and
exercisable prior to the Closing exercises such Option prior to Closing, then
the number set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 2.2(a)
and the first number set forth in the second sentence of Section 2.2(a) shall
each be increased by the sum of the Option Payment attributable to such
Option plus the exercise price (net of any cash payment due to the holder of
Options in connection with such exercise) for such Option, and the Option
Payment attributable to such Option shall not be payable. Any termination of
an Option holder\'s employment by, or service as an officer of, SBG or any
affiliate thereof on or within two (2) Business Days following the Closing
shall be treated as a termination without "Cause," as defined in the Option
Plan, for purposes of determining such person\'s rights under his or her
Options, after taking into account this Section 5.14.   5.15 DEBT
AGREEMENTS. During the period from the date hereof until the Closing, Parent
and Merging Companies shall comply in all material respects with, and cause
each Beverage Company to comply in all material respects with, all of the
covenants and obligations of such Merging Company or Beverage Company under
each of the 10-1/4% Indenture, the 10-1/4% Notes, the 2018 Debentures, the
Parent Indenture and the Credit Agreement (collectively, the "DEBT
AGREEMENTS"). Without the prior written consent of CS, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, Parent and Merging Companies shall not,
and shall cause the other Beverage Companies not to, amend, modify, waive,
terminate or supplement any Debt Agreement in a manner which would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   5.16 CONFIDENTIALITY. From and after the
date hereof, each party hereto will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and
their respective agents and representatives to hold, in strict confidence

administrative process (including, without limitation, in connection with
obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby of any Governmental Authority) or by other requirements
of law or (ii) disclosed in any action or proceeding brought by a party
hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies hereunder,

Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or such other party\'s
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as provided in Section 5.8 hereof or
to the extent that such documents or information can be shown to have been
(a) previously known by the party receiving such documents or information,
(b) in the public domain (either prior to or after the furnishing of such
documents or information hereunder) through no fault of such receiving party
or (c) becomes known to the receiving party from or through another source if
the receiving party is not aware that such source is under an obligation to
another party hereto or to any Beverage Company to keep such documents and
information confidential PROVIDED that after the Closing, the foregoing
restrictions will not apply to CS\'s use or disclosure of documents and
information concerning the Beverage Companies and their respective businesses
furnished by Parent and Merging Companies hereunder, and PROVIDED FURTHER
that from and after the Closing, the foregoing restrictions shall apply to
Parent with respect to all confidential and proprietary information regarding
any Beverage Company and their respective businesses without reference to (1)
any qualification as to having obtained such information from CS, or (2)
clause (a) above. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy at
law for breach of this Section 5.16 would be inadequate, and Parent and
Merging Companies hereby consent to the granting by any court of competent
jurisdiction of an injunction or other equitable relief, without the
necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order that the breach or
threatened breach of such provisions may be effectively restrained.   5.17
SECURITIES LAW FILINGS. Each of Parent and CS shall furnish, or cause to be
furnished, to the other party all information relating to the Beverage
Companies that is available to it and that the other party is required to
include in, or requires for the preparation of or verification of information

Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
the securities laws of any State, or comparable laws or regulations of any
other jurisdiction, including, in the case of CS, any filing required to be
made by CS or any Subsidiary of CS in connection with or as a result of the
actions contemplated by Sections 5.11 or 5.12. Without limiting the
foregoing, within ten (10) days following the date on which CS receives
written notice from Parent that Parent is required to include in a specific
filing financial information of the Beverage Companies for any period prior
to the Closing Date, CS shall permit, and cause its Affiliates to permit,
Parent and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books, records,
accountants (subject to their availability) and personnel of CS and its
Affiliates relating to the Beverage Companies solely for the purpose of
obtaining the required information and, if necessary, conducting an audit of

for the relevant period or periods.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO

and 7.5 and except as otherwise provided in Article VIII and Sections

indemnify, defend and hold harmless CS and Merger Subs and, if applicable,
their directors, officers, employees, representatives, advisors, agents and
Affiliates (other than employees of the Beverage Companies) (the "CS
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from, against and in respect of any Losses arising out

of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merging Companies
contained in this Agreement; or   (b) the breach in any material respect of

7.1, all claims for indemnification under this Article VII or under Section
5.11 or 5.12 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:   (a) In the event
that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state of facts which could
give rise to any claim or demand, for which an Indemnifying Party may be
liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be
collected by a third party (an "ASSERTED LIABILITY"), the Indemnified Party
shall as soon as reasonably possible notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of such Asserted Liability, specifying the nature of such Asserted Liability
(the "CLAIM NOTICE"); PROVIDED, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days (or less if the nature of the Asserted
Liability requires) from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the "NOTICE
PERIOD") to notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party
desires, at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense and by counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend against such
Asserted Liability; PROVIDED, that (i) if, under applicable standards
of professional conduct a conflict on any significant issue between
the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party exists in respect of such
Asserted Liability, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees and expenses of one additional
counsel (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party). The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent
to any settlement unless such settlement (i) includes a complete release of
the Indemnified Party and (ii) does not require the Indemnified Party to make
any payment or forego or take any action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control, pay or settle any Asserted
Liability which the Indemnifying Party shall have undertaken to defend so
long as the Indemnified Party shall also waive any right to indemnification
therefor by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to
defend against such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall control the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof. If the Indemnified Party is
controlling the defense of any Asserted Liability in accordance with this
Section 7.4 (i) at the request of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party will at its own cost and expense provide reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in defending the Asserted Liability and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in any such
defense at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnified Party shall control
the investigation, defense and settlement thereof at the reasonable cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any settlement of any Asserted Liability effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).   (b)
In the event that an Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being
asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from
the date such Claim Notice is delivered during which to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of any good faith objections it has to the
Indemnified Party\'s Claim Notice or claims for indemnification,
setting forth in reasonable detail each of the Indemnifying Party\'s
objections thereto.  If the Indemnifying Party does deliver such written
notice of objection within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute
within thirty (30) days of the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such
written notice of objection.   (c) With respect to the liabilities for
which Parent shall be required to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.3(a)(i) resulting from a breach of Section 3.16, CS Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate with Parent, provide Parent as promptly as possible
with all relevant materials, information and data requested by Parent and
shall grant Parent, without charge, reasonable access to employees and
premises of the Beverage Companies, including the right to conduct
environmental tests thereon and to take samples therefrom.   (d) CS and
Merger Subs acknowledge that except for rights of specific performance
expressly described herein, the indemnification provisions contained in this
Article VII and in Article VIII and in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 constitute
CS\'s and Merger Subs\' sole remedy with respect to any of the matters
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule
or any Exhibit hereto. Each of CS and Merger Subs acknowledges and agrees
that: (i) CS and its representatives have the experience and knowledge to
evaluate the business, financial condition, assets and liabilities of the
Beverage Companies; and (ii) in determining to effect the Mergers and acquire
Merging Companies as Subsidiaries, CS has made its own investigation into,
and based thereon CS has formed an independent judgment concerning, Merging
Companies and the underlying assets and liabilities of the Beverage Companies
(including the real property, fixtures and the tangible personal property).
CS and Merger Subs hereby waive, release and agree not to make any claim or
bring any contribution, cost recovery or other action against Merging
Companies, its Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, attorneys, accountants, agents and
employees and their heirs, successors and assigns, under the Environmental
Laws, common law, or any similar federal, state or local environmental law or
regulation now existing or hereafter enacted other than for Losses which
Parent is expressly required to indemnify CS under this Article VII. CS and
Merger Subs agree that they will not bring any such claim or action under any
Environmental Laws or any other environmental law or regulation which seeks
to allocate liabilities between CS and Merger Subs, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, in a different manner than as expressly set
forth in this Agreement   7.5 LIMITS ON INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the right to indemnification
under this Article VII (but not Sections 5.11 and 5.12) shall from and after
the Closing be subject to the following terms:   (a)(i) except as provided
in clause (ii) below, Parent shall not be liable to CS Indemnified Parties
for any Losses with respect to the matters enumerated in Section 7.3(a)
unless the Losses therefrom exceed an aggregate amount equal to $10 million
(the "THRESHOLD"), and then only for such Losses in excess of $10 million and
only up to an aggregate amount equal to $200 million (the "PARENT CAP");  
(ii) any Losses relating to breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.9 (but only with respect to federal or
state Income Taxes) and 3.14 shall not be subject to the Threshold or the
Parent Cap, and claims for indemnification as a result of breaches of such
sections may be made without regard to the Threshold or the Parent Cap but
shall not in the aggregate exceed the Merger Consideration; and   (iii) no
individual Loss will count towards the Threshold unless such Loss equals or
exceeds $200,000.   (b)(i) except as provided in clause (ii) below, CS
shall be liable to Parent Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect
to the matters enumerated in Section 7.2(a) only up to an aggregate amount
equal to $200 million (the "CS CAP").   (ii) claims for indemnification as
a result of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.2, and claims for indemnification that involve the recission,
cancellation or other unwinding of the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of the representation and warranty asserted to have been breached,
shall not be subject to the CS Cap, and may be made without regard thereto,
but shall not in the aggregate exceed the Merger Consideration.   7.6
CHARACTERIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. All amounts paid by CS, Merger
Subs, Parent or Merging Companies, as the case may be, under this Article VII
or Article VIII shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration
and to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.   7.7 COMPUTATION OF LOSSES;
DISPUTES. The amount of any Losses or Taxes for which indemnification is
provided under this Article VII or Article VIII shall be reduced by (x) any
related Tax benefits if and when actually realized or received (but only
after taking into account any Tax benefits (including, without limitation,
any net operating losses or other deductions and any carryovers or
carrybacks) to which the Indemnified Party would be entitled without regard
to such item), except to the extent such recovery has already been taken into
account in determining the amount of any such Losses or Taxes, and (y) any
insurance recovery if and when actually realized or received, in each case in
respect of such Losses or Taxes, and any recovery or indemnification present
under any agreement with respect to the sale of stock or assets to a Beverage
Company if and when actually realized or received. Any such recovery shall be
promptly repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party following
the time at which such recovery is realized or received pursuant to the
previous sentence, minus all reasonably allocable costs, charges and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if (x) the amount of Indemnifiable Losses or Taxes for which
the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party is
reduced by any Tax benefit or insurance recovery in accordance with
the provisions of the previous sentence, and (y) the Indemnified Party
subsequently is required to repay the amount of any such Tax benefit or
insurance recovery or such Tax benefit or insurance recovery is disallowed,
then the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify with respect to
such amounts shall be reinstated immediately and such amounts shall be paid
promptly to the Indemnified Party in accor dance with the provisions of this
Agreement. In determining the amount of Losses or Taxes for purposes of
Section 7.5(i), the reductions set forth in this Section 7.7 shall be taken
into account, and if such reductions reduce the aggregate Losses or Taxes to
an amount less than $10 million, all amounts previously paid to the
Indemnified Party shall be repaid to such Indemnifying Party.    ARTICLE
VIII   TAX MATTERS; TAX INDEMNIFICATION   8.1 TAX INDEMNITIES. (a) From
and after the Closing Date, Parent shall be responsible for, shall pay or
cause to be paid, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CS and the
Beverage Companies against and reimburse CS and the Beverage Companies for:
(i) any Tax with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof that ends on or
before the Closing Date for which any Beverage Company may be liable under
Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law); (ii) all income Taxes (or Taxes based on net
income) ("INCOME TAXES") of the Beverage Companies with respect to any Tax
period or portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date in excess
of $3,468,000 (after federal tax benefits computed at 35% with respect to
$2,815,000 of such amount);1/(iii) all Taxes of the Beverage Companies other
than Income Taxes with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof that ends
on or before the Closing Date and other than Conveyance Taxes (as defined in
Section 8.6) in excess of the sum of (x) the aggregate accruals for current
Taxes (other than Income Taxes) not yet due and payable on the 3.7 Balance
Sheets hereof, (y) accruals in the ordinary course of business after July 2,
2000 and (z) $831,000 (after federal tax benefits computed at 35% with
respect to $650,000 of such amount)2/; (iv) any Income Tax of the Beverage
Companies with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof that ends on or
before the Closing Date, arising out of, resulting from or related to, the
elections under Sections 338 and 338(h)(10) of the Code provided for in the
Tax Agreement and; (v) any Tax of the Beverage Companies with respect to
any Tax period or portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date
arising out of, resulting from or related to the Restructuring; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no indemnity shall be provided under this Agreement by Parent
for any Tax resulting from any transaction of the Beverage Companies
occurring on the Closing Date but after the Closing that is not in the
ordinary course of business or is not provided for in the Tax Agreement. At
the election of Parent, made at any time, 50% of any number set forth in this
Section 8.1(a)(ii) may be reduced (or increased) and a corresponding increase
(or reduction) made to the corresponding number set forth in Clause (z) of
Section 8.1(a)(iii). Any obligation for indemnity provided for in Section
8.1(a)(iii) shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of Section 7.5
and shall be included as a Loss under those provisions.   (b) From and
after the Closing Date, CS and the Beverage   -------- [FN] 1/ $2,815,000
of reserves for income taxes and $653,000 of interest thereon. 2/ $650,000 of
reserves for other taxes plus $181,000 of interest thereon.    Companies
shall, jointly and severally, be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be
paid, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Merging Companies
and their Affiliates against and reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for all
Taxes Parent and its Affiliates may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of or in connection with the Beverage Companies that
are not subject to indemnification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
8.1 (other than Conveyance Taxes), including, but not limited to, Taxes
resulting from any transaction of the Beverage Companies occurring on the
Closing Date but after the Closing that is not in the ordinary course of
business or is not provided for in the Tax Agreement. CS agrees to comply
with all provisions of Article VIII of the Stock Purchase Agreement ("QUAKER
AGREEMENT") between the Quaker Oats Company ("QUAKER") and Parent, dated as
of March 27, 1997 required for Parent to obtain indemnification for Taxes
from Quaker pursuant to Article VIII of the Quaker Agreement and promptly to
pay over to Parent all taxes received by or credited to a Beverage Company
which Parent is obligated to pay to Quaker pursuant to the Quaker Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such payment shall reduce Parent\'s indemnification
obligation to CS hereunder.   (c) Payment by an indemnitor of any amount
due to an indemnitee under this Section 8.1 shall be made within 10 days
following written notice by the indemnitee that payment of such amounts to
the appropriate Tax authority is due by the indemnitee, provided that the
indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than five days
before it is due to the appropriate Tax authority. In the case of a tax that
is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3, payment of the
Tax to the appropriate Tax authority will not be considered to be due earlier
than the date a final determination to such effect is made by such Tax
authority or a court.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement
(including without limitation determining Parent\'s indemnification
obligations under Section 8.1(a)), in the case of any Tax that is imposed on
a periodic basis and is payable for a period that begins before the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes payable for
the period ending on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of any Tax
other than a Tax based upon or measured by income, the amount of such Tax for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
(x) if any property, asset or other right of a Beverage Company is sold or
otherwise transferred prior to the Closing Date, then ad valorem Taxes
pertaining to such property, asset or other right shall be attributed
entirely to the pre-Closing period, and (y) if any property, asset or other
right of a Beverage Company is purchased or otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date, then ad valorem Taxes pertaining to such property, asset or
other right shall be attributed entirely to the post-Closing period, and (ii)
in the case of any Tax based upon or measured by income, the amount which
would be payable if the taxable year ended as of the close of the Closing
Date, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Tax resulting from the departure of a
Beverage Company from an affiliated, combined or consolidated group in which
it was a member in a pre-Closing period (resulting from the triggering into
income of deferred intercompany transactions under Section 1.1502-13 of the
Treasury regulations or excess loss accounts under Section 1.1502-19 of the
Treasury regulations or otherwise) shall be allocated to a pre-Closing
period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to
be allocated under this Section 8.1(d) shall be computed by reference to the
level of such items on the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) if any
property, asset or other right of a Beverage Company is sold or otherwise
transferred prior to the Closing Date, then any such Tax computed
by reference to such property, asset or other right shall be attributed
entirely to the pre-Closing period, and (y) if any property, asset or other
right of a Beverage Company is purchased or otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date, then any such Tax computed by reference to such property, asset
or other right shall be attributed entirely to the post-Closing period.  
8.2 REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. Parent shall be entitled to any refund or
credit of Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto), and CS shall promptly pay to Parent any such refund or
credit of Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) received by or credited to CS or the Beverage Companies relating to
Taxes for which Parent is responsible under Section 8.1(a) hereof, net of any
costs or expenses incurred by CS or the Beverage Companies with respect to
such refund or credit. In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for
which a payment has been made to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.2 is
subsequently redeemed or disallowed, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Beverage Companies against and reimburse the Beverage Companies
for any Tax liability, including interest and penalties, assessed against
such Beverage Company by reason of the reduction or disallowance; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any repayment of any refund or credit of Taxes shall be limited
to the net amount of such refund received by the Parent pursuant to the
preceding sentence. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, any such refund or other benefit realized by any Beverage Company
in a post-Closing period that results from the carryforward of any net
operating loss or capital loss or other Tax attributes (but not including
overpayments or prepayments of Tax attributable to a period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing) of a Beverage Company in any
Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be
the property of such Beverage Company and shall be retained by such Beverage
Company.   8.3 CONTESTS. (a) After the Closing, the party first
receiving notice shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any
demand or claim on the first party from any Tax authority or other party with
respect to Taxes for which the other party is liable pursuant to Section 8.1.
Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If such notifying party fails to
give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required
by this Section 8.3, then (a) if the other party is precluded by the failure
to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted Tax liability in both the
administrative and judicial forums, then such notifying party shall have sole
responsibility for such Tax liability or (b) if the other party is not
precluded from contesting but such failure to give prompt notice results in
detriment to the other party, then any amount that the other party is
otherwise required to pay to such notifying party pursuant to Section 8.1
with respect to such liability shall be reduced by the amount of such
detriment.   (b) Parent, at its own expense, shall control the conduct to a
final determination, through counsel of its own choosing at its own expense,
of any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may be
sought by CS under Section 8.1(a) (any such audit, claim for refund
or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as
a "CONTEST"). Parent shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or
concede such asserted liability and CS shall cooperate, and shall cause a
Beverage Company or any of its successors to cooperate, in each phase of such
Contest PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not settle, compromise or
concede any such liability that is reasonably likely to result in a cost to
CS or its Affiliates in excess of $100,000.00 without CS\'s consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld.  Parent shall inform CS of all material
developments and events relating to such Contest (including, without
limitation, providing to CS copies of all written materials relating to such
Contest reasonably requested by CS), and CS and its authorized
representatives shall be entitled, at the expense of CS, to attend, but not
participate in or control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating
to such Contest.   8.4 PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS. Except as provided in the
Tax Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file all Tax Returns with respect to
Taxes for which Parent has agreed to indemnify CS in Section 8.1(a) (other
than Taxes described in Section 8.1(a)(iii)) for any Tax period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and which are required to be filed after the
Closing Date on a basis consistent with prior tax years unless different
treatment is required by applicable law. Without limitation to the
obligations of Parent under Section 8.1(a), Parent shall pay any Taxes shown
to be due on such Tax Returns subject to the obligations of CS under Section
8.1(b). CS shall prepare and file all Tax Returns with respect to the
Beverage Companies other than those which Parent is to prepare pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 8.4. Without limitation to the obligations
of CS under Section 8.1(b), CS shall pay any Taxes shown to be due on such
Tax Returns subject to the obligations of Parent under Section 8.1(a). The
parties agree that if a Beverage Company is permitted, but not required,
under applicable state, local or foreign income or franchise tax laws to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Tax period, they will treat the
Tax period as ending on the Closing Date. CS will deliver to Parent for its
review and approval a complete copy of each Tax Return required to be filed
by CS or a Beverage Company under this Section 8.4 for Tax periods that end
on or prior to the Closing Date or that include the Closing Date redacted as
appropriate to remove information about non-Beverage Companies, and any
amendments to such Tax Return, accompanied by an allocation between the pre-
Closing period and the post-Closing period of any Taxes shown to be due on
such Tax Return at least 45 days prior to the date such Tax Return is to be
filed with the appropriate Tax authority. Within 20 days after the date of
receipt by Parent of such Tax Return and allocation Parent may deliver to CS
a written request for changes to such Tax Return or allocation. If CS and
Parent have been unable to resolve their differences within 10 days after CS
has received Parent\'s written request for changes to such Return and
allocation, then any disputed issues shall be immediately submitted to an
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve (within 10 days after receipt of such
disputed issues) in a final binding manner after hearing the views of both
parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
shared equally between Parent and CS. In the case of a Tax Return
that includes a period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, not later than (i) five Business Days before the due
date (including any extension thereof) for Taxes with respect to such Tax
Return or (ii) in the event of a dispute, five Business Days after the
resolution thereof either by mutual agreement of the parties or by a
determination of an Independent Accounting Firm, without prejudice to the
obligations of the parties under Section 8.1, each party shall pay the
portion of the Taxes set forth on such Tax Return that are allocable to the
portion of the period for which such party bears responsibility, after giving
effect to any agreement of the parties or any determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm, net of any payments made prior to the Closing
Date in respect of such Taxes, whether as estimated Taxes or otherwise.  
8.5 COOPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. Parent, CS and the Beverage
Companies will provide each other with such cooperation and information as
any of them reasonably may request of another in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or
a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or
other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall
include the preparation of tax packages for Parent in substantially the same
form and at the same time in which such information customarily was provided
to Parent in previous Tax periods and providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related
work papers and comments relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
authorities. Each such party shall make its employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, each party required to
file Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement shall bear all costs of filing
such Tax Returns. Each such party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers and all material records or other documents relating to Tax
matters of the Beverage Companies for their Tax period first ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later of (a) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax periods to which such Tax
Returns and other documents relate, or (b) eight years following the due date
for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this Section 8.5 shall
be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding. CS further agrees to comply, and to cause the Beverage
Companies to comply, with the terms of IRS record retention requirements,
including any record retention agreement entered into between the IRS and

parties hereto recognize that the laws and public policies of the various
States of the United States may differ as to the validity and enforceability
of covenants similar to those set forth in this Article X. It is the
intention of the parties that the provisions of this Article X be enforced to
the fullest extent permissible under the laws and policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such laws or policies) of
any provisions of this Article X shall not render unenforceable, or impair,
the remainder of the provisions of this Article X. Accordingly, if at the
time of enforcement of any provision of this Article X, a court of competent
jurisdiction holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum
period, scope, or geographic area reasonable under such circumstances will be
substituted for the stated period, scope or geographical area and that such
court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover
the maximum period, scope and geographical area permitted by law.   10.3
EQUITABLE REMEDY. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy at
law for any breach of the provisions of this Article X would be inadequate,
and Parent and Merging Companies hereby consent to the granting by any court
of competent jurisdiction of an injunction or other equitable relief, without
the necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order that the breach
or threatened breach of such provisions may be effectively restrained.  
ARTICLE XI   GENERAL PROVISIONS   11.1 EXTENSION; WAIVER. The parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.  No waiver of any
term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or
condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.   11.2 AMENDMENT. This

of CS, Merger Subs, Parent and Merging Companies at any time prior to the

("CS_Parent"), CSN Acquisition Inc., CRC Acquisition Inc., Snapple Beverage
Group, Inc. And Royal Crown Company, Inc., have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of September 15, 2000 (such agreement as it may be

AGREEMENT")   WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CS Parent
has agreed to take all actions as shall be necessary to assume all of
the obligations of Parent under the Indenture, dated as of February 9, 1998,
among Parent and the Bank of New York, as trustee (such agreement as it may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"PARENT INDENTURE"), and under the Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2018 that were issued pursuant to the Parent Indenture (the
"2018 DEBENTURES")   WHEREAS, in accordance with the ISuiwlemental
IndentureJ, CS has agreed to assume all of the Parent\'s obligations under
the Parent Indenture and the 2018 Debentures;   WHEREAS, the Parent
Indenture and the 2018 Debentures provide that the 2018 Debentures are
convertible into shares of the Parent\'s Common Stock, all as provided in the
Parent Indenture and the 2018 Debentures;   WHEREAS, as an inducement for CS
to undertake the obligations contemplated by Section 5.11 of the Merger
Agreement and to enter into the Supplemental Indenture and to enable CS to
comply with the conversion provisions of the Parent Indenture and the 2018
Debentures, Parent has agreed to enter into this Agreement and to deposit the
Convertible Shares (as defined below) with the Custodian;   WHEREAS, the
parties hereto desire the Custodian to receive, hold and transfer the
Convertible Shares in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of
this Agreement, and the Custodian is willing to do so;   WHEREAS, it is the

Debentures and the parent Indenture.     WHEREAS, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement is a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:   1. DELIVERY OF CONVERTIBLE SHARES. Concurrent with the execution
of this Agreement, the Custodian will segregate and hold for the benefit of
the holders of the 2018 Debentures a certificate (the "ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE")
representing 3,407,400 treasury shares (the "CONVERTIBLE SHARES") of the
Parent\'s Class A Common Stock, par value $.l0 per share ("COMMON
STOCK").  Parent represents and warrants to CS and the Custodian that the
Convertible Shares are duly authorized and that, upon delivery by the
Converting Holder of the related 2018 Debentures being converted and payment
with respect thereto in accordance with this Agreement, the Convertible
Shares delivered to such Converting Holder will be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from all pre-
emptive rights and free of all liens or other adverse rights other than those
created by the Purchaser or a Converting Holder.   2. DUTIES OF THE
CUSTODIAN. The Custodian is hereby authorized and directed (a) to hold in
custody the Original Certificate and the Replacement Certificate (as defined
below), (b) from time to time in accordance with Section 3 of this agreement
and provided CS has complied with Section 4 hereof, in its capacity as the
Parent\'s transfer agent to issue (i) a stock certificate or certificates to
a Converting Holder representing the Convertible Shares being acquired by
such Converting Holder upon conversion of those of its 2018 Debentures
properly surrendered for conversion and (ii) a new certificate
(the "REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATE") representing the aggregate remaining
Convertible Shares not then being converted by Converting Holders and (c) in
accordance with Section 7 of this Agreement, on the next business day after
the Termination Date (as defined below), to return to the Parent the Original
Certificate or Replacement Certificate then held by the Custodian
representing the Convertible Shares that have not been issued to holders of
the 2018 Debentures on or prior to the Termination Date.   3. CONVERSION.
(a) If, in accordance with the terms of the Parent Indenture and the 2018
Debentures, any holder of the 2018 Debentures (a "CONVERTING HOLDER")
exercises its right to convert one or more of such Converting Holder\'s 2018
Debentures for Common Stock, CS shall deliver to Custodian and Parent a copy
of the conversion notice (in the form attached to the Supplemental Indenture)
executed by the Converting Holder, a copy of the 2018 Debenture (marked
"Copy") tendered for conversion and, if applicable, evidence that the
Converting Holder has complied with clauses (3) and (4) of the third
paragraph of Section 9 of the 2018 Debenture. Unless a Blackout (as defined
below) is then in effect, within two business days after receipt of
such notice, Custodian, in its capacity as Parent\'s transfer agent, shall,
subject to compliance by CS with the terms of Section 4 hereof: (a) issue and
deliver to the Converting Holder a certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Common Stock into which the Converting Holder has requested
the surrendered 2018 Debentures be converted under the terms of the Parent
Indenture and the 2018 Debentures and a check in the amount required to pay
for any fractional shares; and (b) cancel the Original Certificate or the
then-current Replacement Certificate and prepare and hold a Replacement
Certificate for the number of Convertible Shares remaining after giving
effect to such conversion. Upon the issuance of the Common Stock to the
Converting Holder, CS, the Parent and the Custodian shall take all action
necessary to cause the 2018 Debentures or portion thereof that were
surrendered by such Converting Holder to be cancelled.   4. DELIVERY OF
FUNDS BY CS. As a condition to the release to a Converting Holder of any
certificate representing Convertible Shares, CS shall concurrently therewith
deliver to Custodian immediately available funds equal to the accreted value,
through the date of conversion, of all 2018 Debentures being then converted
(the "ACCRETED VALUE"). Upon receipt of such funds and such other documents
as are required pursuant to Section 3 above, Custodian is authorized to
deliver the Convertible Shares to the Converting Holder (plus such funds
as may be necessary to pay for any fractional shares), and shall
immediately deliver the Accreted Value (less any funds necessary to pay the
Converting Holders for any fractional shares) to Parent.   5. SHELF
REGISTRATION; BLACKOUTS.   (a) Pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement, dated _____, 2000, between Parent and CS (the "Registration Rights
Agreement"), Parent agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement for an offering to
be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
thereunder, registering the delivery from time to time on behalf of CS Entity
of Convertible Shares to Converting Holders upon conversion of 2018
Debentures.   (b) If Parent shall deliver to CS and the Custodian
a certificate in writing executed by an officer thereof that the use of
the Prospectus included in the Registration Statement (each such term as
defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) covering the delivery of
Convertible Shares to Converting Holders upon conversion of 2018 Debentures
has been suspended, upon receipt of such certificate, the Custodian may not
deliver any Convertible Shares to Converting Holders pursuant to this
Agreement until the Custodian is advised in writing by Parent that use of the
Prospectus may be resumed (a "Blackout"). Parent has agreed with CS Entity
that it will not be entitled to exercise its right to effect a Blackout
except as follows: Parent may effect a Blackout for a period not to exceed 30
days in any three-month period, or not to exceed an aggregate of 90 days in
any 12-month period. Parent is not permitted to extend a Blackout beyond such
30-day period.   6. CONVERSION RATE.   (a) At the Closing Date (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), the Convertible Shares do and shall represent the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which the 2018 Debentures are
convertible based on a conversion rate of 9.465 shares of Common Stock per
$1,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Debentures at maturity (the
"CONVERSION RATE"). The Conversion Rate is the rate that is currently in
effect and shall be in effect on the Closing Date with respect to the
conversion of the 2018 Debentures into shares of Class A Common Stock.  
(b) In the event that Parent shall, directly or indirectly, take any action
(an "Adjustment Event") which results in or necessitates an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate and/or the required issuance, upon conversion of the
aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Debentures at maturity or otherwise,
of shares of Common Stock exceeding the number of shares of Common Stock
represented by the Convertible Shares including, without limitation, any of
the actions described in Sections 11.06, 11.07, 11.08 and 11.12 of the Parent
Indenture, then, no later than five (5) business days after the Adjustment
Event, Parent shall deliver to the Custodian such number of additional shares
of Common Stock, determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
Parent Indenture, as is necessary to reflect the Adjustment Event. If as a
result of an Adjustment Event or otherwise the Custodian has deposited with
it more Convertible Shares than are necessary to allow for the full
conversion of the then outstanding 2018 Debentures ("EXCESS SHARES"), Parent
may deliver a certificate executed by an officer thereof to CS and the
Custodian and upon receipt the Custodian shall promptly surrender to Parent a
certificate representing the number of Excess Shares.   (c) In the event
that Parent (i) effects any reclassification of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value or
from no par value to par value), (ii) enters into any consolidation, merger
or business combination with another corporation or entity or similar
transaction as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with
respect to or in exchange for their Common Stock ("SUBSTITUTE SECURITIES") or
(iii) effects any sale or conveyance of any properties or assets to any other
corporation or entity as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive Substitute Securities with respect to or in exchange for
their Common Stock, then Parent shall deliver to Custodian and CS a notice of
such event, a certificate setting forth the Substitute Securities into which
2018 Debentures may be converted and such number of Substitute Securities as
are necessary so that each 2018 Debenture holder shall be entitled
to receive, upon any future conversion of the 2018 Debentures held by such
holder, the kind and amount of Substitute Securities that a holder of the
number of Convertible Shares issuable upon conversion of each holder\'s 2018
Debentures immediately prior to such transaction would have received had each
holder converted its 2018 Debentures immediately prior to the transaction.
Upon delivery to the Custodian of such Substitute Securities, Custodian shall
return to Parent all Convertible Shares no longer required for delivery to
Converting Holders.   7. TERMINATION DATE. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the "TERMINATION DATE" shall mean the earlier of (i) the first
date upon which no 2018 Debentures remain outstanding and (ii) February 9,
2003. On the next business day after the Termination Date, the Custodian
shall surrender to Parent the Original Certificate or the Replacement
Certificate, as applicable, representing all of the shares of Common Stock
held by the Custodian pursuant to this Agreement that were not transferred to
or on behalf of the holders of 2018 Debentures in connection with the
conversion of such Debentures.   8. TREASURY SHARES. The Convertible Shares
and the Substitute Securities, if any, until delivered to Converting Holders
pursuant to the terms of the Parent Indenture and this Agreement, shall
continue to be treasury shares of the Parent and shall not be or deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose including, without limitation, with respect to
any vote to be taken by the holders of the Common Stock, the payment of
dividends, if any, by Parent or any rights upon dissolution, winding up or
liquidation of Parent. Neither the Custodian nor CS shall have any rights
with respect to Convertible Shares or Substitute Securities including the
right to vote such shares, the right to receive dividends with respect to
such shares or the right to receive any distributions upon dissolution,
winding up or liquidation.   9. THE CUSTODIAN.   (a) The Custodian shall
have no duties or obligations hereunder except those specifically set forth
herein and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Agreement. In connection with its duties
hereunder, the Custodian shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting upon any written notice, request, consent, certificate, order,
affidavit, letter, telegram or other document furnished to it hereunder and
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
party or parties; and the Custodian shall not be liable for anything it may
do or refrain from doing in connection with its duties hereunder, except for
such liabilities as may result from its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Custodian shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
by it in good faith unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Custodian\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause
of loss to another party hereto. In the administration of its duties under
this Agreement, the Custodian may execute any of its powers and perform its
duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys and may consult with
counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by
it. The Custodian shall not be liable for the performance of agents selected
by it with reasonable care or for anything done, suffered or omitted in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel,
accountants or other skilled persons.   (b) In the event the Custodian shall
be uncertain as to its duties or rights under this Agreement or shall receive
any instruction, claim or demand which, in the opinion of the Custodian, is
in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement (any of the foregoing, a
"CUSTODIAN DISPUTE"), the Custodian shall be entitled to refrain from taking
any action with respect to such Custodian Dispute until it shall be directed
otherwise by a final and nonappealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or by an instrument signed by Parent and CS. In the event of any
Custodian Dispute, the Custodian Agent shall be entitled to petition a court
of competent jurisdiction in Delaware or New York to resolve such Custodian
Dispute, and Parent and CS hereby consent to the jurisdiction of any such
court with respect to any such Custodian Dispute.   (c) Parent and CS,
jointly and severally, agree to pay to the Custodian the fees set forth in
the letter agreement dated September ___ 2000 and to reimburse the Custodian
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable counsel fees and disbursements, incurred by the Custodian in
connection with the performance of its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. The parties cannot request or require that the Custodian perform
any duties outside the scope of this Agreement. As between themselves, Parent
and CS shall each be liable for 50% of all fees and expenses to be paid or
reimbursed to Custodian hereunder. In the event that either party fails to
pay any amount due to Custodian hereunder, the other party shall be entitled
to pay such amount on behalf of the defaulting party and the defaulting party
shall be obligated promptly to reimburse the other party for any amounts so
paid.   (d) The Custodian may resign at any time by giving at least
30 days\' prior written notice to Parent and CS, which resignation shall
become effective only upon the acceptance of appointment by a successor
Custodian as hereinafter provided. The resigning Custodian may appoint a
successor Custodian, reasonably acceptable to Parent and CS, or Parent may
appoint a successor Custodian reasonably acceptable to CS (it being agreed
that any independent third party transfer agent for the Common Stock shall be
acceptable to CS). If a successor Custodian shall not have been appointed
within 20 days after such notice of resignation, Parent or CS may apply to
any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Custodian. Any
successor Custodian, however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor Custodian an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon
such successor Custodian shall, without further act, become fully vested with
all the rights, powers, obligations and duties of the predecessor Custodian
hereunder with the same effect as if originally named the Custodian
herein.   10. FURTHER ACTIONS. From and after the date hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall execute and deliver such documents and shall take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the transaction contemplated
hereby.   11. NOTICES. All notices, requests and other communications

(including the reasonable fees and expenses of in-house or outside counsel)
arising out of or in connection with (a) its execution and performance of
this Agreement, except to the extent that such loss, liability or expense is
due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Custodian, or (b)
its following any instructions or other directions from the Parent. Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the
Custodian be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage
of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if

and regardless of the form of action. The parties hereto acknowledge that

AGREEMENT, dated as of ________, 2000 (this "AGREEMENT"), by and between
CADBURY SCHWEPPES PLC, an English public limited company ("CS"), and TRIARC
COMPANIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "PARENT"),   Pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 15, 2000, among CS, CSN
Acquisition Inc., CRC Acquisition Inc., Snapple Beverage Group, Inc., Royal
Crown Company, Inc. and Parent (including any amendments thereto, the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"), CS has agreed to assume all of the Merging Companies\' and
TCPG\'s obligations under the 10-1/4% Indenture, including, without
limitation, all obligations with respect to the 10-1/4% Notes and to assume
all of the Parent\'s obligations under the Parent Indenture, including,
without limitation, all obligations with respect to the 2018 Debentures
(collectively, the "ASSUMED DEBT");   Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Merger
Agreement;   It is a condition to the obligations of Parent and the
Merging Companies to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement that CS execute and deliver this Agreement.   Accordingly, the
parties agree as follows:   1. INDEMNIFICATION BY CS.   1.1. CS\'S
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. CS shall be liable to and indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Parent and its directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, New LLC), affiliates, successors and assigns
(each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages, losses,
claims, charges, actions, suits, proceeding, deficiencies, taxes, interest,
penalties, liabilities, payments of any nature and costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
(each a "LOSS" and collectively the "LOSSES") based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of the Assumed Debt, except to the extent CS or
its affiliates are entitled to indemnification under Section 5.11.11, 5.12.7
or 7.3 of the Merger Agreement.   2. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.   2.1. NOTICE OF
ASSERTED LIABILITY. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice
of any demand, claim or circumstances by a third party which, with the lapse
of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or
threatened commencement) of any action, audit, proceeding or investigation
(an "ASSERTED LIABILITY") that may result in a Loss in respect of which
indemnification may be sought from CS under this Agreement such Indemnified
Party shall give written notice thereof (the "INDEMNIFICATION NOTICE") to CS.
The Indemnification Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary
and to the extent it is feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be
suffered by such Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification
Notice promptly shall not bar indemnification hereunder except and only to
the extent such failure materially prejudiced the party against whom
indemnification is sought.   2.2. OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND. CS shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any Asserted Liability for which it has an
obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 1.1 hereof
at its own expense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Indemnified Party may, at its own expense,
retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any action, claim or proceeding in which the defendants include
both an Indemnified Party and CS, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
such Indemnified Party, (i) there are or may be legal defenses available to
such Indemnified Party or to other Indemnified Persons that are different
from or additional to those available to CS or (ii) a conflict or potential
conflict exists between CS, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, that would make separate representation advisable, such
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably
satisfactory to CS at the expense of CS and to control its own defense of
such action, claim or proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that CS shall not be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel to all Indemnified
Parties in any one legal action or group of related legal actions. If CS does
not assume the defense of any Asserted Liability within thirty (30) days (or
less if the nature of the Asserted Liability requires its receipt of the
Indemnification Notice), the Indemnified Party shall control
the investigation, defense and settlement thereof at the reasonable cost of
CS, and CS shall make or cause to be made available to the Indemnified Party
any books, records or other documents within its control that are reasonably
requested by the Indemnified Party for such defense. CS shall not be liable
for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected against an
Indemnified Party without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   2.3. AUTHORITY OF CS. In the event an
Indemnification Notice is delivered to CS in respect of an Asserted Claim,
and CS assumes the defense thereof, CS shall have the discretion to make all
decisions and determinations permitted or required to be made by CS under
Section 2.2 above with respect to such Asserted Claim, and Parent shall make
or cause to be made available to CS any books, records or other documents
within its control that are reasonably requested by CS for such defense. CS
agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which shall not be unreasonable withheld or delayed, settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or
threatened claim, action or proceeding unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes a full and unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties
from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or
proceeding.   3. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS. Any legal
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement shall
be instituted in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, and each party agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that
it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of any such Court, that the
action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this
Indemnification Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in
or by any such Court. Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
any such Court in any such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of
process and any other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be
effective against any party if given personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, or by any other means of mail that requires a
signed receipt, postage prepaid, mailed to such party as herein provided.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the rights of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by law.   4. MISCELLANEOUS.   4.1.
NOTICES. Any notice or other communication required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been delivered when delivered
by hand or sent by telecopier (with receipt confirmed), or if delivered by
courier shall be deemed given on the close of business on the second Business

delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.   4.4.

Effectiveness Period.   (c) The Company shall supplement and amend
the Shelf Registration if required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act.   (d) The Purchaser
agrees that Registrable Securities may be delivered by the Company (or by the
Purchaser, if it is deemed a selling stockholder) pursuant to a Shelf
Registration and related Prospectus only as necessary to satisfy its
obligation under the Indenture to deliver Common Stock to Holders who have
requested conversion of Debentures, and may do so only in accordance with
this Section 2(d) and the terms of the Custody Agreement. In the event (A) of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(c)(ii),
3(c)(iii), 3(c)(iv), 3(c)(v) or 3(c)(vi) hereof or (B) that, in the judgment
of the Company, it is advisable to suspend use of the Prospectus for a
discrete period of time due to pending material corporate developments or
similar material events that have not yet been publicly disclosed and as to
which the Company believes that public disclosure would not be in the best
interests of the Company, the Company shall deliver a certificate in writing,
signed by an authorized executive officer of the Company, to the Purchaser
and the Custodian that the use of the Prospectus has been suspended and, upon
receipt of such certificate, the Purchaser will not deliver any Registrable
Securities upon conversion of Debentures until the Purchaser\'s
and Custodian\'s receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
provided for in Section 2(c) hereof, or until it (and the Custodian) is
advised in writing by the Company that the Prospectus may be used and the
Purchaser has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that
are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such Prospectus (a
"Blackout"). The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as soon as practicable and, in the
case of a pending development or event referred to in Section 2(d)(B) hereof,
as soon as the earlier of (x) public disclosure of such pending material
corporate development or similar material event, (y) in the judgment of the
Company, public disclosure of such material corporate development or similar
material event would be in the best interests of the Company or (z) the
original circumstances creating such pending material corporate development
or similar material event cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not under any circumstances be entitled to exercise its right
under this Section 2(d) to effect a Blackout except as follows: the Company
may effect a Blackout in accordance with this Section 2(d) for a period not
to exceed 30 days in any three-month period, or not to exceed an aggregate of
90 days in any 12-month period. In no event shall the Company be permitted to
extend a Blackout beyond such 30-day or 90- day period.   3. REGISTRATION
PROCEDURES. In connection with the Company\'s registration obligations under
Section 2 hereof, the Company shall effect such registrations to permit the
sale of the Registrable Securities solely as necessary to enable the
Purchaser to satisfy its obligation under the Indenture to deliver Common
Stock to Holders in connection with the conversion of Debentures, and
pursuant thereto the Company shall as expeditiously as possible (and with
respect to clause (a), no later than the Closing Date):   (a) Prepare and
file with the SEC a Registration Statement or Registration Statements on any
appropriate form under the Securities Act available for the sale and delivery
of the Registrable Securities upon conversion of the Debentures solely as
necessary to enable the Purchaser to satisfy its obligation under the
Indenture to deliver Common Stock to Holders in connection with the
conversion of Debentures, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as
provided herein; PROVIDED that before filing any such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (other than documents
that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference
and that the Company is required by applicable securities laws or stock
exchange requirements to file) the Company shall furnish to the
Purchaser copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents
will be subject to the review of the Purchaser and its counsel, and the
Company shall not file any such Registration Statement or amendment thereto
or any Prospectus or any supplement thereto (other than such documents which,
upon filing, would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference
therein and that the Company is required by applicable securities laws or
stock exchange requirements to file) to which the Purchaser shall reasonably
object in writing within two full Business Days.   (b) Prepare and file
with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each
Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement continuously effective for the applicable period specified in
Section 2; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required
Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement and
Prospectus upon conversion of the Debentures.   (c) Notify the Purchaser and
the Custodian, promptly, and (if required by the Purchaser) confirm such
notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus, any Prospectus supplement, a
Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment to a Registration
Statement has been filed with the SEC, and, with respect to a Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state
governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration
Statement or related Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the
suspension of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation
or threatening of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by
the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the existence of any
fact or happening of any event which makes any statement of a material fact
in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or
which would require the making of any changes in the Registration Statement
or prospectus in order that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Company\'s determination that a post-
effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.   (d)
Use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the lifting of
any suspension of the qualification (or exemption for qualification) of any
of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest
possible moment.   (e) If reasonably requested by the Purchaser
(i) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment to a Registration Statement such information as the Purchaser
reasonably considers should be included therein as required by applicable
law, and (ii) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such
post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has
received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment; PROVIDED, that the Company shall not
be required to take any actions under this Section (3)(e) that are not, in
the opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable
law.   (f) Furnish to the Purchaser, without charge, at least one conformed
copy of the Registration Statement or Statements and any amendment thereto,
including financial statements but excluding schedules, all documents
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all
exhibits.   (g) Deliver to the Purchaser without charge, as many copies of
the Prospectus or Prospectuses relating to such Registrable Securities
(including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement
thereto as the Purchaser may reasonably request; and the Company hereby
consents to the use of such Prospectus or each amendment or
supplement thereto by the Purchaser in connection with the delivery of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto to Holders as contemplated by this Agreement.   (h)
Cause the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities within the United States, except as may be required
solely as a consequence of the nature of the Purchaser, in which case the
Company will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such
Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals, as may be
necessary to enable the Purchaser to consummate the delivery of Registrable
Securities as contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) During any period other
than during a Blackout, immediately upon the existence of any fact or the
occurrence of any event as a result of which a Registration Statement
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or a Prospectus contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, promptly
prepare and file (subject to the proviso in Section 3(a)) a post-effective
amendment to each Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any
other required document (such as a Current Report on Form 8-K) that would be
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement so that the
Registration Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and so that
the Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of
the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, and, in the case of
a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement, use its reasonable
efforts to cause it to become effective as soon as practicable.   (j) Cause
the Common Stock covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each
securities exchange or quoted on each automated quotation system on which any
of the Company\'s "Common Stock," as that term is defined in the Indenture,
is then listed or quoted no later than the date the Registration is declared
effective and, in connection therewith, to the extent applicable, to make
such filings under the Exchange Act (e.g., the filing of a Registration
Statement on Form 8-A) and to have such filings declared effective
thereunder.   (k) Cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made
with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE").   (l) To register or
qualify or cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the registration
or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of
such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue
Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Purchaser
reasonably requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification
(or exemption therefrom) effective during the period such Registration
Statement is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or
things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions
of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement; provided, that the Company will not be required to (i) qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
qualified or (ii) take any action that would subject it to general service of
process in suits or to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject.   (m) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC and make generally available to its security holders earning statements
(which need not be audited) satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under
the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 52- or 53-week
period (or 90 days after the end of any 52- or 53-week period if such period
is a fiscal year) commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of
the Company commencing after the effective date of a Registration Statement,
which statements shall cover said 52- or 53-week periods.   (n) Cooperate
with the Purchaser to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing
any restrictive legends; and enable such Registrable Securities to be in such
denominations and registered in such names as the Purchaser may request.  
4. PURCHASER\'S OBLIGATIONS. In the event Purchaser is deemed to be a selling
stockholder under the Registration Statement, the Purchaser agrees that it
shall not be entitled to deliver any of such Registrable Securities pursuant
to a Registration Statement or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto,
unless the Purchaser has furnished the Company with such information
regarding the Purchaser and the distribution of such Registrable Securities
as the Company may from time to time reasonably request. The Purchaser agrees
promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed
in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by the
Purchaser not misleading. Any delivery of any Registrable Securities by the
Purchaser shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Purchaser
that the information relating to the Purchaser and the distribution of
Registrable Securities is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by the
Purchaser in connection with such disposition, that such Prospectus does not
as of the time of such delivery contain any untrue statement of a material
fact relating to the Purchaser or the distribution and that such Prospectus
does not as of the time of such delivery omit to state any material fact
relating to the Purchaser or the distribution necessary to make the
statements in such Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.   5. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. All fees and expenses
incident to the Company\'s performance of or compliance with this Agreement
shall be borne by the Company whether or not any of the Registration
Statements become effective. Such fees and expenses shall include, without
limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses (x) with respect to filings or listing, as
applicable, required to be made with the SEC or the NYSE and (y) relating to
compliance with Federal securities or Blue Sky laws), (ii) printing expenses
(including, without limitation, expenses of printing certificates for
Registrable Securities), (iii) the reasonable fees and disbursements of the
Trustee and its counsel and of the registrar and transfer agent for the
Common Stock, (iv) messenger, telephone and delivery expense relating to the
performance of the Company\'s obligations hereunder, (v) reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company in connection with the Shelf
Registration, (vi) fees and disbursements of the Company\'s
independent accountants and (vii) Securities Act liability insurance, to the
extent obtained by the Company in its sole discretion. In addition, each of
the Purchaser and the Company shall pay its internal expenses (including,
without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees
performing legal or accounting duties.   6. INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls the Purchaser (within the
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act) from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses
(including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or
claim) (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except as to the Purchaser insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based
upon the information relating to the Purchaser or the intended distribution
by the Purchaser furnished to the Company in writing by the Purchaser
expressly for use therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
liable to the Purchaser (or any person controlling the Purchaser) to
the extent that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
any preliminary Prospectus if either (A)(i) the Purchaser, if required,
failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus with or prior to
delivery of written confirmation of the sale by the Purchaser to the person
asserting the claims from which such Losses arise and (ii) the Prospectus
would have corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
such omission or alleged omission, or (B)(x) such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission is corrected in an
amendment or supplement to the Prospectus and (y) having previously been
furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so
amended or supplemented, the Purchaser, being required to deliver such
Prospectus, thereafter fails to deliver such Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented, with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the
sale of a Registrable Security to the person asserting the claim from which
such Losses arise.   (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. The Purchaser
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its
officers who sign a Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company, (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against all
losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus
or arising out of or based upon any omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
to the extent, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information relating to the Purchaser so furnished in
writing by the Purchaser (or its representative) to the Company expressly for
use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus.   (c) CONDUCT OF
INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS. In case any proceeding (including any
governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two
preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly
notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought
(the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon
request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and
any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall
pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the
right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention
of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of
the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding
or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
counsel) for the Purchaser and all persons, if any, who control the Purchaser
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act, and (b) the fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its
officers who sign a Registration Statement and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case
of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and
control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by
the Company. In such case involving the Purchaser, and persons who control
the Purchaser, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchaser. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of
any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified
party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes
an unconditional release of such indemnified party and its Affiliates from
all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.  
(d) CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is
unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof in
respect of any Losses or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party
harmless, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying
such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such Losses, (i) in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying
party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the
other hand or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the
relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and
of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with
the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Purchaser
on the one hand and the Company on the other hand shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Purchaser or by the
Company and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.   The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by PRO RATA allocation or by
any other method or allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to
in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to
the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent
  misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution form any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentations.   The indemnity, contribution and
expense reimbursement obligations of the Company hereunder shall be in
addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have hereunder, under the
Merger Agreement or otherwise.   The indemnity and contribution provisions
contained in this Section 6 shall remain operative and in full force and
effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or the Company, its
officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) the
sale of any Registrable Securities by the Purchaser.   7.
MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach by the Company of
its obligations under this Agreement, the Purchaser, in addition to being
entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery
of damages, and all rights under the Merger Agreement and the Indemnity
Agreement, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of
any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.   (b) NO CONFLICTING
AGREEMENTS. The Company has not, as of the date hereof, and shall not, on or
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to
its securities which conflicts with the rights granted to the Purchaser in
this Agreement. The Company represents and warrants that the rights granted
to the Purchaser hereunder do not in any way conflict with the rights granted
to the holders of the Company\'s securities under any other agreements.  
(c) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement, including the
provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the
Purchaser.   (d) NOTICES. All notices and other communications provided for
or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be deemed given (i)
