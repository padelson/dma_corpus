the manufacture, sale or distribution of Product; and (iv) any activity of
SELLER unrelated to the Business. The retained rights set forth in
the foregoing sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above shall be subject

conducting any of SELLERs business activities unrelated to the Business.

Business.

  



  

2.6 _Non Product-Specific Manufacturing Information_.  Upon Closing, SELLER
shall grant, or shall cause to be granted to BUYER, a perpetual, paid up,

rights to use Non-Product Specific Manufacturing Information outside the
Business, SELLER shall retain a non-exclusive license to use Non-Product-
Specific Manufacturing Information in the Business, solely for purposes of
fulfilling its obligations hereunder or carrying out activities related to

labeling and packaging which properly identifies BUYER as the marketer of the
Product and does not contain any references to SELLER or its Affiliates.

communications in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.
 After transfer of responsibility to BUYER pursuant to this Article
3, SELLER shall, except in the case of medical emergency, refer all
questions relating to the Product raised by health care professionals and
customers to BUYER for its response. Should any medical inquires received by
BUYER concern an adverse experience with the Product, BUYER shall notify
SELLER of such adverse experience in accordance with Section 7.5, including

charge backs, rebates and Medicare reimbursements for Product sold by BUYER
after the closing.

5.4 _No Obligation of SELLER to Manufacture Product_. Other than SELLERs
transfer of the Product Inventory to BUYER hereunder, and SELLERs supply
hereunder of ETI Columns and Reagents during the Transition Period (or any
applicable Shortened Transition Period), SELLER shall not be obligated to
manufacture for BUYER, or have made for or supplied to BUYER, any Product,
any bulk Active Ingredient or any other ingredient(s) of Product.

  



  

5.5 _Shipment; Transfer of Title._ ETI Columns and Reagents ordered by BUYER

21   

     
   

  



  

5.8 _Quality Disputes_. Any claim by BUYER that any ETI Column or Reagent(s)
supplied to BUYER does not satisfy SELLERs warranties under Section 5.7 must
be made in writing within thirty (30) days after discovery by BUYER of the
problem, and in no event later than ninety (90) days following BUYERs
receipt of the ETI Column or Reagents in question; provided however that in
the case of a latent defect in the column that cannot be reasonably
discovered through testing or other reasonable means of inspection or
evaluation prior to use thereof, the period of time for submitting a claim
pursuant to this section 5.8 shall be thirty (30) days from the date BUYER
learns of such latent defect. ETI Columns and Reagent(s) rejected by
BUYER shall be returned by BUYER to SELLER at SELLERs expense, and, at

Column(s) and Reagent(s) meeting the ETI Column Specifications (or the
Reagent Specifications or, at BUYERs option, issue a credit for the returned
ETI Columns and Reagents. In the event that BUYER claims that any ETI Column
or Reagent(s) fail to meet their respective specifications as set forth
herein, and SELLER disagrees with BUYERs findings, unless such failure is
apparent on the face of written documentation provided by SELLER with the
shipment of such Product, at SELLERs written request, BUYER shall submit a
sample of the contested ETI Column or Reagent to an unrelated independent
laboratory, reasonably acceptable to SELLER and BUYER, and the check assays
of such laboratory shall be accepted by the two parties as final and binding.
The cost of such analysis made by the laboratory, and the cost of disposal of
disputed ETI Column or Reagent shall promptly be borne by the party whose
position is not substantiated by the independent laboratory.

6.3 _Technology Transfer Work Plans_. SELLER and/or its Affiliates shall
provide technology transfer services to effect transfer from SELLER and/or
its Affiliates of the SELLER Manufacturing Activities to a third party
approved by BUYER under an initial work plan for transfer of each of such
activities, each such work plan being set forth in Exhibit 6.3 (A) through
(F) (the "Technology Transfer Work Plans") corresponding to each of
the SELLER Manufacturing Activities listed in the table of Section 6.2. The
technology transfer services provided by SELLER and/or its Affiliates under
each of the Technology Transfer Work Plans shall be at [****] sole expense
(excluding capital costs which shall be borne by [****]). BUYER and SELLER
agree that the Technology Transfer Work Plans are based upon a good faith
estimate, as of the Closing Date, of the expected Transfer Completion Dates
for the SELLER Manufacturing Activities. The Technology Transfer Work Plans
will be diligently reviewed by both parties on a quarterly basis and, as
necessary, revised from time to time in order that they remain a good faith
assessment of the activities and work required by both parties
to successfully transfer the SELLER Manufacturing Activities to BUYER or a
third party reasonably approved by BUYER.

  



  

6.4 _Limit on SELLER s Technology Transfer Obligations_. Provided SELLER has
not materially breached its obligations hereunder with respect to carrying
out its responsibilities under the mutually agreed Technology Transfer Work
Plans required under Section 6.3, SELLER shall not be obligated to provide,
or cause to be provided, additional technology transfer services beyond the
expiration of the Full Transition Period (or, if applicable any Shortened
Transition Period) absent SELLERs written consent to be given or withheld in
SELLERs sole and absolute discretion; provided however, that should BUYER
fail to cooperate with SELLER in the manner provided in Section 6.9, and such
failure of cooperation prevents the parties from achieving a Transfer
Completion Date for a given SELLER Manufacturing Activity, SELLER shall not
be in breach for failing to meet SELLERs obligations to perform the work set
forth

  

   

*Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

  



  

24   

     
   

  



  

in the applicable Technology Transfer Work Plan and shall not be obligated to
continue to provide Technology Transfer Services with respect to the activity
in question, or to perform the activity in question, beyond the date of the
expected Transfer Completion Date established in writing between the parties
in the then currently applicable Technology Transfer Work Plan, regardless of
whether transfer of the activity in question to a third party has been
completed in the manner described in Section 1.61.  In no event shall SELLER
have any obligation to BUYER hereunder with respect to any of the SELLER
Manufacturing Activities after expiration of the Full Transition Period.

  



  

6.5 _Continuation of SELLER Manufacturing Activities after Closing_. Prior to
the Transfer Completion Date for a given SELLER Manufacturing Activity A
through F (but in no event after the earlier of the expiration of the Full
Transition Period, or any applicable Shortened Transition Period for such
activity) SELLER shall continue to carry out, or cause to be carried out, in
the same manner as carried out as of the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) subject to the terms and conditions of Article 5, the SELLER
Manufacturing Activities C, D and E listed in Section 6.1; and

  



  

(b) at no charge to BUYER, the SELLER Manufacturing Activities A, B and F
listed in Section 6.1.

  



  

6.6 _Clot Lysis Testing_. SELLERs performance of Clot Lysis Testing of Bulk
Active Ingredient and Clot Lysis Testing of Fill and Finished Product
hereunder shall be in accordance with the test procedures set forth in

appropriate documentation reasonably satisfactory to BUYER and acceptable to
the FDA documenting the performance and results of such testing on all bulk
Active Ingredient and Fill and Finished Product (other than the Product
Inventory) performed by SELLER prior to the transfer of such testing
responsibility to BUYER or its designee hereunder.

  



  

6.7 _Limitation on SELLER Technology Transfer Obligations_.  In no event
shall SELLER have any obligation to BUYER hereunder with respect to any of
the SELLER Manufacturing Activities after expiration of the Full Transition
Period (or any applicable Shortened Transition Period).

  



  

25   

     
   

  



  

6.8 _Cooperation; Contracting with Third Parties_.

  



  

(a) _Cooperation on Technology Transfer Work Plans_.  The parties understand
BUYER does not (with the exception of SELLER Manufacturing Activity F) have
the capabilities to assume the SELLER Manufacturing Activities, nor the
expertise to jointly manage, or jointly carry out with SELLER, the effective
transfer of such activities to a third party. Accordingly, BUYERs obligation
to cooperate with respect to establishing and carrying out the Technology
Transfer Work Plans shall be limited to activities reasonably required by
SELLER that do not require or involve manufacturing know-how or expertise on
the part of BUYER with respect to the SELLER Manufacturing Activities,
including without limitation (i) as owner of the Registrations, undertaking
primary responsibility for, and reasonably cooperating with SELLER with
respect to, securing FDA approval of the SELLER Manufacturing Activities
transferred to a third party; (ii) reasonably cooperating with SELLER in
identifying, and assuming primary responsibility for approving, third parties
to carry out the SELLER Manufacturing Activities; and (iii) assuming primary
responsibility for, and reasonably cooperating with SELLER with respect to
negotiating and entering into contractual arrangements with such third
parties (including binding or non-binding terms or letters of intent with
such third parties).

  



  

(b) _Limitation on SELLER s Contracting Obligations_.  SELLER shall not be
required to contract with any third party to perform the SELLER Manufacturing
Activities, except with respect to any transitional contracting with such
third party which may be reasonably required prior to the Transfer Completion
Date of such third partys performance of a given SELLER Manufacturing
Activity; provided however that, with respect to such transitional
contracting, including any binding or non-binding letters of intent, BUYER
and SELLER shall jointly contract with such third party under terms and
conditions that will specify that SELLER shall no longer be a party to such
contract after the Transfer Completion Date. The identification and evaluation
and selection of any party or entity to whom the SELLERs Manufacturing
Activities will be transferred pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sole
responsibility of, and shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of, the
BUYER; provided however (i) SELLER shall afford reasonable consultation to
BUYER with respect to selecting and qualifying potential vendors; (ii) such
consultation shall not result in SELLERs assumption of any responsibility,
risk or Liability with respect to BUYERs identification, evaluation,

  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

selection, and contracting of suitable vendors, except those obligations
specifically undertaken by SELLER hereunder, and (iii) BUYER hereby
indemnifies SELLER for any Liability with respect to BUYERs identification,
evaluation, selection and contracting of potential vendors, in accordance
with the indemnification provisions of Article 13.

  



  

6.9 _Extension/Assignment of Roche Supply Agreement_. In the event SELLER
and/or BUYER enter into an agreement with Roche Diagnostics, GmbH (or an
affiliate thereof) providing: [****].

SELLER will forward to BUYER a complete copy of the Registrations
for Product, as well as copies of all correspondence with, and periodic and
other reports (including adverse event reports and the underlying data)
to, regulatory authorities in the Territory.  SELLER will cooperate with
BUYER, at no charge, to ensure a smooth transition of the activities
contemplated hereby, and in obtaining the cooperation of SELLERs Affiliates
and its distributors and licensees of the Product with the transfer of
adverse experience reporting obligations from SELLER to BUYER.

Product and/or the manufacture thereof. After such transfer has been
completed, BUYER shall have responsibility for all such communication and
each party shall promptly provide the other with copies of any communications
or contacts it sends to or receives from any other governmental agency in the
Territory concerning the Product, other than communications by BUYER
concerning promotional materials, with respect to which BUYER shall not be
required to provide copies to SELLER.

  



  

7.4 _Governmental Inspections_. Each party shall advise the other party of

manufacture, storage or handling of Product, or the marketing,
selling, promotion or distribution of any Product, promptly after any such
visit or inquiry (or in advance, for any scheduled visits). Each party shall
promptly furnish to the other party any report or correspondence issued by or
provided to the governmental authority in connection with such visit or
inquiry, purged only of Confidential Information of such party wholly
unrelated to the other partys activities under this Agreement and any
information that is unrelated to the Product. Each party shall permit
the relevant governmental authorities to inspect its facilities in connection
with the activities contemplated by this Agreement.

continue the FINESSE Clinical Trial; shall retain all responsibility with
respect thereto; shall keep BUYER informed with respect to all matters
related thereto; and shall afford BUYER a meaningful opportunity to consult

after Closing, BUYER shall be responsible for supplying Product for the
FINESSE trial to the FINESSE clinical study sites at the same cost currently
charged by SELLER with respect to SELLERs supply of Product to such clinical
study sites. BUYER understands and acknowledges that SELLER is presently
conducting an interim analysis on the FINESSE trial data and BUYER agrees

 _CONFIDENTIALITY_

  



  

8.1 _Confidentiality_. Each party has disclosed, and may hereafter from time
to time in the course of the performance of this Agreement
disclose, Confidential Information to the other party.  Each party shall
hold in confidence all Confidential Information of the other party and shall
take all reasonable steps to prevent disclosure to, or use of the
Confidential Information of the other party by, any third party, except as
permitted under this Agreement or as necessary to carry out the activities
contemplated hereby. Further, neither party shall, without the prior written

confidentiality at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement,
who have a need to know such information in connection with such party
performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement.
 Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the disclosure of
Confidential Information to any lender, potential lender or agent under the

foregoing who have a need to know such information in the representation of
the foregoing, provided that such lender, potential lender or agent, rating
agency or advisor shall have agreed to keep such Confidential Information
confidential on terms substantially equivalent to this Section 8.1. No
provision of this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude such
disclosure of Confidential Information as may be inherent in or reasonably
necessary to the securing from any governmental agency of any necessary
approval or license related to the Product, or to the obtaining of patents.
Upon the termination of this Agreement, and upon the written request of the
other party, each party shall promptly return to the other party all copies

filing, shall provide SELLER and its counsel with a redacted version of this
Agreement (or any other related documents) which it intends to file, and will
give due consideration to any comments provided by SELLER or its counsel and
use reasonable efforts to ensure the confidential treatment by the SEC of
those sections specified by SELLER or its counsel.

thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect thereof. After notice to the
Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Partys election to assume the defense
of such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for such legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof at the request of the Indemnifying Party. As to
those actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of
the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying Party an
opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost and expense, and will
consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise disposing
of any of the same. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with
respect to any Claim asserted by a governmental entity relating to Taxes, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense, but the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Indemnified Party will not
settle any such Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

13.8 _Limitation; Exclusivity_. No Claim shall be made or have any validity
unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such Claim to
the Indemnifying Party, subject to the time limits of Section 13.10. If full
recovery under any such Claim is not had within three months of such written
notice, arbitration must be commenced within 30 days following the end of
such three-month period or such Claim shall be invalidated. This Article
13 provides the exclusive means by which a Party may assert Claims against
the other party and Article 14 provides the exclusive means by which a
Party may bring actions against the other Party with respect to any breach by
the other party of its indemnification obligations under this Article 13.

13.9 _Scope of SELLER s Liability_.  Indemnification shall be available to
the BUYER Indemnitees under Section 13.5 only to the extent the aggregate
amount of Liabilities otherwise due to the BUYER Indemnitees for all claims
for such indemnification exceeds [****] of the Purchase Price and then
indemnification shall be available to the BUYER Indemnitees for the amount of
all payments due to the BUYER Indemnitees in excess of such amount, but in no
event greater than [****]. SELLER shall have no liability or obligation to
indemnify BUYER with respect to the misrepresentation of any
representation or breach of any warranty based on any facts or circumstances
known to the BUYER from the information provided in any disclosure memoranda,
management presentations, data rooms, or given in writing to BUYER prior to
the Closing.

  



  

13.10 All representations and warranties herein shall survive the Closing
until the date [****] from the Closing Date, and shall then expire and be of
no force or effect.

  



  

### _ARTICLE 14_

  

### _DISPUTE RESOLUTION_

  



  

14.1 _Mediation_

  



  

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or related to this
agreement, or the interpretation, application, breach, termination or
validity thereof, including any claim of inducement by fraud or otherwise,
which claim would, but for this provision, be submitted to arbitration shall,
before submission to arbitration under section 14.1 hereof first be mediated
through non-binding mediation in accordance with The CPR Mediation Procedure
then in effect of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (CPR) available
at www.cpradr.org/m_proced.htm, except where that procedure conflicts with
these provisions, in which case these provisions control. The mediation shall
be conducted in New York City and shall be attended by a senior executive
with authority to resolve the dispute from each of the operating companies
that are parties.

  

   

*Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

(b) The mediator shall be neutral, independent, disinterested and shall be
selected from a professional mediation firm such as ADR Associates or
JAMS/ENDISPUTE or CPR.

  



  

(c) The parties shall promptly confer in an effort to select a mediator
by agreement. In the absence of such an agreement within 10 days of
initiation of the mediation, the mediator shall be selected by CPR as
follows: CPR shall provide the parties with a list of at least 15 names from
the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals. Each party shall exercise
challenges for cause, two peremptory challenges, and rank the remaining
candidates within 5 working days of receiving the CPR list. The parties may
together interview the three top-ranked candidates for no more than one hour
each and, after the interviews, may each exercise one peremptory challenge.
 The mediator shall be the remaining candidate with the highest
aggregate ranking.

  



  

(d) The mediator shall confer with the parties to design procedures to
conclude the mediation within no more than 45 days after initiation. Under no
circumstances may the commencement of arbitration under this Article 14 be
delayed more than 45 days by the mediation process specified herein absent
contrary agreement of the parties.

  



  

(e) Each party agrees not to use the period or pendency of the mediation to
disadvantage the other party procedurally or otherwise.  No statements made
by either side during the mediation may be used by the other or referred to
during any subsequent proceedings.

  



  

(f) Each party has the right to pursue provisional relief from any court,
such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid
irreparable harm, maintain the _status_ _quo_ , or preserve the subject
matter of the arbitration, even though mediation has not been commenced or
completed.

  



  

14.2 _Arbitration_

  



  

(a) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising from or related in any way to
this Agreement or the interpretation, application, breach, termination or
validity thereof, including any claim of inducement of this Agreement by
fraud or otherwise, will be submitted for resolution to arbitration pursuant
to the rules then pertaining of the CPR

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

Institute for Dispute Resolution for Non-Administered Arbitration (available
at www.cpradr.org/arb-rules.htm), or successor ("CPR"), except where those
rules conflict with these provisions, in which case these provisions control.
The arbitration will be held in New York City.

  



  

(b) The panel shall consist of three arbitrators chosen from the CPR Panels
of Distinguished Neutrals (or, by agreement, from another provider of
arbitrators) each of whom is a lawyer with at least 15 years experience with
a law firm or corporate law department of over 25 lawyers or who was a judge
of a court of general jurisdiction. In the event the aggregate damages sought
by the claimant are stated to be less than $5 million, and the aggregate
damages sought by the counterclaimant are stated to be less than $5 million,
and neither side seeks equitable relief, then a single arbitrator shall be
chosen, having the same qualifications and experience specified above. Each
arbitrator shall be neutral, independent, disinterested, impartial and shall
abide by The CPR-Georgetown Commission Proposed Model Rule for the Lawyer as
Neutral available at www.cpradr.org/cpr-george.html.

  



  

(c) The parties agree to cooperate (1) to attempt to select the arbitrator(s)
by agreement within 45 days of initiation of the arbitration, including
jointly interviewing the final candidates, (2) to meet with the arbitrator(s)
within 45 days of selection and (3) to agree at that meeting or before upon
procedures for discovery and as to the conduct of the hearing which will
result in the hearing being concluded within no more than nine (9) months
after selection of the arbitrator(s) and in the award being rendered within
60 days of the conclusion of the hearings, or of any post-hearing briefing,
which briefing will be completed by both sides within 45 days after the
conclusion of the hearings.

  



  

(d) In the event the parties cannot agree upon selection of the
arbitrator(s), the CPR will select arbitrator(s) as follows: CPR shall
provide the parties with a list of no less than 25 proposed arbitrators (15
if a single arbitrator is to be selected) having the credentials referenced
above. Within 25 days of receiving such list, the parties shall rank at least
65% of the proposed arbitrators on the initial CPR list, after exercising
cause challenges. The parties may then interview the five candidates (three
if a single arbitrator is to be selected) with the highest combined rankings
for no more than one hour each and, following the interviews, may exercise
one peremptory challenge each.

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

The panel will consist of the remaining three candidates (or one, if one
arbitrator is to be selected) with the highest combined rankings. In the
event these procedures fail to result in selection of the required number of
arbitrators, CPR shall select the appropriate number of arbitrators
from among the members of the various CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals,
allowing each side challenges for cause and three peremptory challenges each.

  



  

(e) In the event the parties cannot agree upon procedures for discovery and
conduct of the hearing meeting the schedule set forth in paragraph c above,
then the arbitrator(s) shall set dates for the hearing, any post-hearing
briefing, and the issuance of the award in accord with the paragraph c
schedule. The arbitrator(s) shall provide for discovery according to those
time limits, giving recognition to the understanding of the parties that they
contemplate reasonable discovery, including document demands and depositions,
but that such discovery be limited so that the paragraph c schedule may be
met without difficulty. In no event will the arbitrator(s), absent agreement
of the parties, allow more than a total of ten days for the hearing or permit
either side to obtain more than a total of 40 hours of deposition testimony
from all witnesses, including both fact and expert witnesses, or serve more
than 20 individual requests for documents, including subparts, or 20
individual requests for admission or interrogatories, including subparts.
Multiple hearing days will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent
possible.

  



  

(f) The arbitrator(s) must render their award by application of the
substantive law of New York and are not free to apply "amiable compositeur"
or "natural justice and equity." The arbitrator(s) shall render a
written opinion setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law with
the reasons therefor stated. A transcript of the evidence adduced at the
hearing shall be made and shall, upon request, be made available to either
party. The arbitrator(s) shall have power to exclude evidence on grounds of
hearsay, prejudice beyond its probative value, redundancy, or irrelevance and
no award shall be overturned by reason of such ruling on evidence. To the
extent possible, the arbitration hearings and award will be maintained in
confidence.

  



  

(g) In the event the panels award exceeds $5 million in monetary damages or
includes or consists of equitable relief, or rejects a claim in excess of
that amount or for

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

that relief, then the losing party may obtain review of the arbitrators
award or decision by a single appellate arbitrator (the "Appeal Arbitrator")
selected from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals by agreement or,
failing agreement within seven working days, pursuant to the selection
procedures specified in paragraph d above. If CPR cannot provide such
services, the parties will together select another provider of arbitration
services that can. No Appeal Arbitrator shall be selected unless he or she
can commit to rendering a decision within forty-five days following oral
argument as provided in paragraph h.  Any such review must be initiated
within thirty (30) days following the rendering of the award referenced in f
above.

  



  

(h) The Appeal Arbitrator will make the same review of the arbitration
panels ruling and its bases that the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Circuit
where the arbitration hearings are held would make of findings of fact and
conclusions of law rendered by a district court after a bench trial and then
modify, vacate or affirm the arbitration panels award or decision
accordingly, or remand to the panel for further proceedings. The Appeal
Arbitrator will consider only the arbitration panels findings of fact and
conclusions of law, pertinent portions of the hearing transcript and
evidentiary record as submitted by the parties, opening and reply briefs of
the party pursuing the review, and the answering brief of the opposing party,
plus a total of no more than four (4) hours of oral argument evenly divided
between the parties. The party seeking review must submit its opening brief
and any reply brief within seventy-five (75) and one hundred thirty (130)
days, respectively, following the date of the award under review, whereas the
opposing party must submit its responsive brief within one hundred ten (110)
days of that date. Oral argument shall take place within five (5) months
after the date of the award under review, and the Appeal Arbitrator shall
render a decision within forty-five (45) days following oral argument.
That decision will be final and not subject to further review, except
pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.

  



  

(i) The parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for
the district in which the arbitration is held for the enforcement of these
provisions and the entry of judgment on any award rendered hereunder
(including after review by the Appeal Arbitrator where such an appeal is
pursued). Should such court for any reason lack jurisdiction, any court with
jurisdiction shall act in the same fashion.

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

(j) Each party has the right before or, if the arbitrator(s) cannot hear the
matter within an acceptable period, during the arbitration to seek and obtain
from the appropriate court provisional remedies such as attachment,
preliminary injunction, replevin, etc. to avoid irreparable harm, maintain
the _status_ _quo_ , or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration.

  



  

(k) **EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY.**

  



  

(l) **EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM TO PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
MULTIPLIED DAMAGES FROM THE OTHER.**

  



  

(m) **EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FROM
THE OTHER.**

  



  

(n) **EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEYS  FEES AND COSTS
AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST FROM THE OTHER.**

  



  

### _ARTICLE 15_

  

### _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

15.1 _Force Majeure_. If the performance by either party of any obligation
under this Agreement is prevented, restricted, interfered with or delayed by
reason of any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party liable to
perform, unless conclusive evidence to the contrary is provided, the party so
affected shall, upon giving written notice to the other party, be excused
from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction,
interference or delay, provided that the affected party shall use its
reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance
and shall continue performance with the utmost dispatch whenever such causes
are removed. When such circumstances arise, the parties shall discuss what,
if any, modification of the terms of this Agreement may be required in order
to arrive at an equitable solution.

  



  

15.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in
the State of New York and its form, execution, validity, construction and
effect shall be

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

determined in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  



  

15.3 _Headings_. All section headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

15.4 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be modified,
if possible, to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable
or, if such modification is not possible, such provision shall be stricken
and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that if a provision is stricken so as to significantly alter the
economic arrangements of this Agreement, the party adversely affected
may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days prior written notice to the
other party. If any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement is in
conflict with any applicable statute or rule of law in any jurisdiction, then
such term or provision shall be deemed inoperative in such jurisdiction to
the extent of such conflict and the parties will renegotiate the affected
terms and conditions of this Agreement to resolve any inequities.

  



  

15.5 _Entire Agreement_. Other than the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties, this Agreement is intended to define the full
extent of the legally enforceable undertakings and representations of the
parties hereto, and no promise or representation, written or oral, which is
not set forth explicitly in such Agreements is intended by either party to be
legally binding.  Each of the parties acknowledge that in deciding to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby
none of them has relied upon any statements or representations, written or
oral, other than those explicitly set forth herein.

  



  

15.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed by both parties
that specifically refers to this Agreement.

  



  

15.7 _Notices_. Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement shall
