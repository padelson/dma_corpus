Section 2.1 _Effect on Battery Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Battery Merger Sub,
Battery or the holders of any shares of Battery Common Stock: 

(a) _Conversion of Battery Common Stock_. Each share of Battery Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
any shares of Battery Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b),
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to terms
and conditions hereof, one fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent
Common Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.1(e) (as
adjusted, the " _Battery Exchange Ratio_ ", such Parent Common Stock, the "
_Battery Merger Consideration_ "), upon (A) surrender of a Battery
Certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
share of Battery Common Stock, in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b) (or,
in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Battery Certificate, Section
2.2(i)) or (B) transfer of an Uncertificated Share, in the manner provided in
Section 2.2(b). As a result of the Battery Merger, at the Effective Time, each
holder of a Battery Certificate or an Uncertificated Share shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Battery
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Battery Common Stock
represented by such Battery Certificate or Uncertificated Share immediately
prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or paid, without interest,
in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Battery Certificate or
transfer of such Uncertificated Share in accordance with Section 2.2(b).

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Battery Common Stock_. Each share of
Battery Common Stock held by Battery as treasury stock, each share of Battery
Common Stock held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Battery, and each
share of Battery Common Stock owned by Parent, RH, either Merger Subsidiary or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof, in each case as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, automatically shall be cancelled and cease to
exist without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be paid with
respect thereto.

(c) _Restricted Stock Awards_. All outstanding restricted stock awards (the "
_Battery Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to Batterys 2009 Incentive
Plan, effective August 28, 2009 (the " _Battery Incentive Plan_ "),
that remain unvested shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section
2.3.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Battery Merger, but in lieu thereof Parent shall
pay to each holder of shares of Battery Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Common 



 

6  Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder), upon surrender of
such holders Battery Certificate(s) or transfer of such holders
Uncertificated Share(s), as applicable, an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) $31.50.

(e) _Adjustments to Battery Exchange Ratio_. The Battery Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Battery Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar change
with respect to Parent Common Stock or Battery Common Stock having a record
date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Battery Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, RH shall cause Parent
to engage a nationally-recognized institution, reasonably acceptable to
Battery, to act as exchange agent in connection with the Battery Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, RH shall cause Parent to deposit
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Battery Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1(a). In addition, at the Effective Time, RH shall cause Parent to deposit
with the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Battery Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash and Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Battery Common Stock (the " _Battery
Certificates_ ") or (ii) an uncertificated share or shares of Battery Common
Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), which at the Effective Time were
converted into the right to receive the Battery Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (including a substitute Form
W-9) and (ii) instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Battery Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Battery Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and as are
reasonably acceptable to Battery) for use in effecting the surrender of
Battery Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in exchange for
the Battery Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon (i) surrender of Battery Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Battery or (ii) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), accompanied by a properly
completed Form of Election, together with such letter of transmittal (or
affidavit of loss in accordance with Section 2.2(i)), 



 

7  duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, a Certification on Form W-9 or W-8 and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Battery
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Battery
Certificates surrendered and Uncertificated Shares transferred by such holder)
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
and (B) payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and Battery Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
so surrendered or transferred, as applicable, shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Battery Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Battery, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person
other than the Person in whose name Battery Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares so surrendered or transferred, as applicable is registered, if such
Battery Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or the Uncertificated Share shall be transferred and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Battery Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as contemplated by
this Section 2.2(b), each Battery Certificate and Uncertificated Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Battery Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender or transfer, as
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c).

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Battery
Certificate or Uncertificated Share which is not transferred, with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.1(d), until such Battery Certificate or Uncertificated Share has
been surrendered or transferred in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Battery Certificate or
transfer of any Uncertificated Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder
thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender or transfer, as
applicable, the Battery Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a),
together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding Taxes that
may be required thereon.



 

8 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Battery Merger Consideration issued
upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of Battery Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any
cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Battery Common Stock previously represented by such Battery
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Battery shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Battery Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Battery Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Battery Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Battery
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Battery Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, and any holders of Battery Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
who theretofore have not complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Battery Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c).

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Battery Merger Sub, Battery, RH, RH Merger
Sub or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Battery
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have been surrendered or
transferred prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Battery Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such
Battery Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Battery Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to former stockholders of Battery after the
Effective Time pursuant to this Article II and (ii) promptly following any
losses which cause the Exchange Fund to then hold less than the aggregate
amount of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) payable in
respect of shares of Battery Common Stock for which payment shall not
theretofore have been made, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Battery Surviving Corporation to, promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former stockholders of Battery to the
extent that such losses have so caused the Exchange Fund to hold less than the
amounts payable in 



 

9  respect of such shares of Battery Common Stock for which payment has not
theretofore been made. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II promptly shall be
paid to Parent.

(h)  _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Battery Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld (and paid to the applicable
Governmental Authority) by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Battery
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Battery
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Battery Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), cash for fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Battery Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or, if reasonably required by Parent, a
bond in such reasonable sum as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of
Battery Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.3 _Battery Equity Awards_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Battery Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Battery Incentive Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

(i) provide that each equity award entitling the holder thereof to acquire
Battery Common Stock pursuant to the Battery Incentive Plan (a " _Battery
Equity Award_ ") shall be converted into an equity award entitling the holder
thereof to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Battery Adjusted
Equity Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Battery Equity Award, including vesting (taking into account any acceleration
of vesting that may occur as a result of the Transaction) except that each
Battery Adjusted Equity Award shall represent the right to acquire that whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the next whole share)
equal to the number of shares of Battery Common Stock subject to a Battery
Equity Award multiplied by the Battery Exchange Ratio; and



 

10 (ii) make such other changes to the Battery Incentive Plan as are appropriate
to give effect to the Transaction.

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 2.3 and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of the Battery Equity Awards, all
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to the
Battery Equity Awards awarded under the Battery Incentive Plan, to the extent
that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall
remain in full force and effect with respect to such Battery Equity Awards
after giving effect to the Transaction and the assumption by Parent as set
forth above.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Battery Merger, the Battery
Incentive Plan shall be assumed by Parent, with the result that
all obligations of Battery under the Battery Incentive Plan, including with
respect to awards outstanding at the Effective Time thereunder, shall be
obligations of Parent following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all necessary actions for the assumption of the
Battery Incentive Plan, including the reservation, issuance and listing of
Parent Common Stock in a number at least equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Battery Adjusted Equity Awards.
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall, in
accordance with applicable federal securities Laws, prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate
form selected by Parent) registering a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. Such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as
Battery Adjusted Equity Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.4  _Battery Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, (i)
each share of capital stock of Battery Merger Sub held by Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished and converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Battery Surviving Corporation and (ii) each share of capital stock of
Battery Merger Sub held by Battery immediately prior to the Effective Time
automatically shall be cancelled and cease to exist without any conversion
thereof, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.

Section 2.5  _Effect on RH Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the RH
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, RH Merger Sub, RH or the
holders of any shares of RH Stock:

(a) _Conversion of RH Stock_.

(i) Each share of RH Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any shares of RH Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.5(b), shall be automatically converted into the right to

of Parent Common Stock (the " _RH Common Merger Consideration_ "), upon
surrender of an RH Certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such share of RH Common Stock, in the manner provided in Section
2.6(a) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, 
Section 2.6(f)).



 

11 (ii) Each share of RH Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of RH
Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.5(b), shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the applicable Preferred
Exchange Ratio of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _RH Preferred Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of an RH
Certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
share of RH Preferred Stock, in the manner provided in Section 2.6(a) (or, in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, Section 2.6(f)).

(iii) Each share of Special RH Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, other than shares of Special
RH Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.5(b), shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the RH Special Preferred
Ratio of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_RH Special Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of an RH Certificate,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such share of
Special RH Preferred Stock, in the manner provided in Section 2.6(a) (or, in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, Section 2.6(f)).

(iv) As a result of the RH Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of an RH
Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the applicable RH Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of RH Stock represented by such RH Certificate immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.5(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.6(b), all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such RH Certificate in accordance with Section
2.6(a).

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of RH Stock_. Each share of RH Stock held
by RH as treasury stock, each share of RH Stock held by any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of RH, and each share of RH Stock owned by Parent,
Battery, RH Merger Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, Battery
or RH Merger Sub, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
automatically shall be cancelled and cease to exist without any conversion
thereof, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.

(c) _RH Options_. All options to purchase RH Stock (the " _RH Options_ ")
issued and outstanding under any equity or equity-based compensation plan or
arrangement of RH, including RHs 2007 Omnibus Equity Award Plan (as amended
on June 24, 2008) (each, an " _RH Incentive Plan_ ") shall be assumed by
Parent in accordance with Section 2.7.

(d) _Restricted Stock Awards_. All outstanding restricted stock unit awards
(the " _RH Restricted Stock Units_ ") granted pursuant to an RH Incentive
Plan that remain unvested shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 2.7.



 

12 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the RH Merger, but in lieu thereof Parent shall pay to
each holder of shares of RH Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such
holder), upon surrender of such holders RH Certificate(s), an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of
(x) such fraction, multiplied by (y) $31.50.

(f) _Adjustments to RH Exchange Ratio_. The RH Common Exchange Ratio, the
Preferred Exchange Ratio and/or the RH Special Merger Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock, Battery Common Stock or any RH Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar change
with respect to Parent Common Stock, Battery Common Stock or any RH Stock
having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt it is
understood and agreed that the transactions contemplated by Section 6.16 shall
not result in any such adjustment.

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of any
RH Stock (the " _RH Certificates_ "), which at the Effective Time were
converted into the right to receive the applicable RH Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.5(a), (A) a letter of transmittal (including a
substitute Form W-9) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of RH Certificates in exchange for the applicable RH Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b). Upon
surrender of RH Certificates for cancellation to Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal (or affidavit of loss in accordance with Section
2.6(f)), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, a Certification on Form W-9 or W-8, the holder of such
RH Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a
certificate or certificates representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all RH Certificates surrendered
by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(a)
(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) and (B) payment in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b), and RH
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of any RH Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of RH, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name RH Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such RH Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a
Person other than the registered holder of such RH Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this 



 

13  Section 2.6(a), each RH Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable RH Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(e) or
Section 2.6(b)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a), Section 2.5(e) or Section
2.6(b).

(b) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered RH
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.5(e), until such RH Certificate has been
surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such RH Certificate, there shall be paid to the
recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender the
applicable RH Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(a), together with
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock less the amount of any withholding Taxes
that may be required thereon.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The applicable RH Merger Consideration
issued upon the surrender for exchange of RH Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5(e) or
Section 2.6(b) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of applicable RH Stock
previously represented by such RH Certificates. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of RH shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the RH Surviving
Corporation of any shares of RH Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, RH Certificates are
presented to the RH Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, RH Merger Sub or RH or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
RH Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
applicable RH Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
issuable in respect of such RH Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such RH Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.



 

14 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a
holder of any RH Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as
Parent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld (and paid to
the applicable Governmental Authority) by Parent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any RH
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed RH Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such RH Merger
Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 2.5(a), cash for
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed RH
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or, if reasonably required by Parent, a bond in such
reasonable sum as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent in respect of RH Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. 

Section 2.7 _RH Equity Awards_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the RH Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering RH Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) adjust the terms of all RH Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time granted under the RH Incentive Plans, whether vested or
unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each RH Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such RH Option, including vesting (taking
into account any acceleration of vesting that may occur as a result of the
Transaction) (each, as so adjusted, an " _RH Adjusted Option_ "), except that
(A) each such RH Adjusted Option shall represent the right to acquire that
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the next whole
share) equal to the number of shares of RH Voting Common Stock subject to the
related RH Option multiplied by the RH Common Exchange Ratio and (B) the
option price per share of Parent Common Stock under each RH Adjusted Option
shall be an amount equal to the option price per share of RH Voting
Common Stock subject to the related RH Option in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the RH Common Exchange Ratio (the option price
per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the next full cent);



 

15 (ii) provide that each other equity award entitling the holder thereof
to acquire RH Voting Common Stock, including RH Restricted Stock Units, other
than RH Options pursuant to an RH Incentive Plan (an " _RH Equity Award_ ")
shall be converted into an equity award entitling the holder thereof to
acquire shares of Parent Common Stock (an " _RH Adjusted Equity Award_ "), on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such RH Equity Award,
including vesting (taking into account any acceleration of vesting that may
occur as a result of the Transaction) except that each RH Adjusted Equity
Award shall represent the right to acquire that whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the next whole share) equal to the number
of shares of RH Common Stock subject to an RH Equity Award multiplied by the
RH Common Exchange Ratio; and

(iii) make such other changes to the RH Incentive Plans as are appropriate to
give effect to the Transaction.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of RH Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the RH Incentive Plans and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such RH Options, and that such RH Options and agreements shall be
assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.7 after
giving effect to the Transaction).

(c) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 2.7 and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of RH Options and RH Equity
Awards, as applicable, all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting
with respect to RH Options and RH Equity Awards awarded under an RH Incentive
Plan, or any other plan, program or arrangement of RH or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not
have already lapsed, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to
such RH Options and RH Equity Awards after giving effect to the Transaction
and the assumption by Parent as set forth above.

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the RH Merger, the RH Incentive Plans
shall be assumed by Parent, with the result that all obligations of RH under
the RH Incentive Plans, including with respect to awards outstanding
thereunder at the Effective Time, shall be obligations of Parent following the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
actions for the assumption of the RH Incentive Plans, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock in a number at least
equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to
RH Adjusted Options and RH Adjusted Equity Awards. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, in accordance with applicable
federal securities Laws, prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form selected by Parent)
registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined in accordance
with the preceding sentence. Such registration statement shall be kept
effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required
thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as RH Adjusted Options and
RH Adjusted Equity Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.8 _RH Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of capital stock of RH
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished and converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the RH Surviving Corporation.

more than five (5) days, and at least three (3) days prior to the Closing

Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than any Indebtedness in respect of the
Harbinger Term Loan Facility) of RH and its Subsidiaries (determined after
giving effect to the transactions described in Section 6.16) outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Assumed Indebtedness Amount_ ");
(ii) the Series D Preference Amount; (iii) the Series E Preference Amount;
(iv) consolidated cash and cash equivalents of RH and its Subsidiaries as of

the knowledge of Battery, any other party to such Battery Real Property Lease

modification or acceleration of rent thereunder, and (iii) neither Battery nor
any of its Subsidiaries is currently subleasing, licensing or otherwise
granting any Person the right to use or occupy such Battery Leased Property
or any portion thereof, except in each case of clauses (i) through (iii) as

"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover

the ability of Battery to perform its obligations under this Agreement or its
ability to consummate the Transaction, including the Battery Merger.

Section 3.13 _Labor Matters_.

(a) Neither Battery nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or any other agreement with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is any such agreement presently being negotiated.

and (ii) does not require any notification to or consent by any labor union,
labor organization or works council.

outside the U.S., such strike or walk-out, has not had or would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Battery
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) To the knowledge of Battery, no employee of Battery or any of its
Subsidiaries who is a "named executive officer" (within the meaning of Item

year is in any material respect in violation of any term of any employment
agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure obligation,
fiduciary duty, non-competition agreement, restrictive covenant or other
obligation to a former employer of any such employee relating (i) to the

Section 3.14 _Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA_.

(a) Section 3.14(a) of the Battery Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each Battery Benefit Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to Battery Benefit Plans that are employment,
severance, change-in-control or other individual agreements with respect to
individuals providing services primarily outside the United States, only
those individual agreements relating to an officer, executive or director
with compensation and/or benefits in excess of $100,000 per year have been
listed. With respect to each Battery Benefit Plan that primarily covers
individuals providing services in the U.S., Battery has provided or made
available to RH a current, accurate and complete copy thereof, and, to the
extent applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument; (ii) the most recent determination letter, if applicable; (iii)
any summary plan description and summaries of material modifications; and (iv)
the most recent years Form 5500 and attached schedules and audited financial
statements, if any.

(b) Each Battery Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualification and, to the knowledge of Battery, no event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
qualification. Each of the Battery Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except as, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a
Battery Material Adverse Effect. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by Battery, any 



 

30  Battery Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of Battery that has not been
satisfied in full (other than with respect to amounts not yet due), except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
likely to have a Battery Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) subject to Title
IV of ERISA and to which Battery, any Battery Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate of Battery contributes or sponsors (each, a " _Title IV Plan_ "),
the present value of projected benefit obligations under such Title IV Plan
did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of
the assets of such Title IV Plan allocable to such projected benefit
obligations by an amount in excess of $10,000,000. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of Battery, threatened, material claims by or on behalf of any
of the Battery Benefit Plans, by any employee or beneficiary covered under
any Battery Benefit Plan or otherwise involving any Battery Benefit Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits), except as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Battery
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Neither Battery nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has been
obligated to contribute during the preceding six years to any "multiemployer
pension plan," as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA.

(d) Section 3.14(d) of the Battery Disclosure Schedule sets forth any medical
or death benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former
employees or directors of Battery or any Battery Subsidiary beyond their
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
solely by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) deferred
compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of Battery or a
Battery Subsidiary or (iv) benefits the full costs of which are borne by the
current or former employee or director or his or her beneficiary.

(e) Neither the negotiation or the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction by Battery (alone or in conjunction with any
other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of Battery or any Battery Subsidiary to
any compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits or trigger
any other material obligation under any Battery Benefit Plan or (iii) result
in any breach or violation of, default under or limit Batterys right to
amend, modify or terminate any Battery Benefit Plan.

(f) Except with respect to individuals identified in Section 3.14(f) of the
Battery Disclosure Schedule, no amount or other entitlement that could be
received as a result of the Transaction (alone or in conjunction with any
other event) by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Code) with respect to Battery will constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of Battery or any Battery
Subsidiary is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason
of the Tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed on such
Person.



 

31 (g) With respect to each Battery Benefit Plan established or maintained
outside of the U.S. primarily for the benefit of employees of Battery or any
Battery Subsidiary residing outside of the U.S. (a " _Foreign Battery Benefit
Plan_ "), except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had or would
not be reasonably likely to have a Battery Material Adverse Effect: (i) all
employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Battery Benefit Plan
required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Battery Benefit Plan have been
made, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with normal accounting
practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign
Battery Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Battery
Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Battery Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations with
respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Battery Benefit Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign
Battery Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

Section 3.15 _Environmental Matters_.

(a) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not and would not
reasonably be expected to result in a liability that is material to Battery

Laws by the Environmental Protection Agency or any other Governmental
Authority or any other Person against Battery or any of its Subsidiaries or

formerly operated or leased by Battery or any of its Subsidiaries or to which
Battery or any of its Subsidiaries could be deemed to hold or have held title
or against any Person whose liability Battery or any of its Subsidiaries has
or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of Law.

(c) Battery and its Subsidiaries have not, since January 1, 2004 received
notice of any allegations of any Environmental Liabilities, including non-
compliance with any applicable Environmental Laws, and no facts, circumstances
or conditions relating to, associated with or attributable to any Real
Property currently or formerly operated or leased or other sites at which
Hazardous Materials were disposed of, or allegedly disposed of, or to which
Battery or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be deemed to hold or have
held title or Batterys or any of its Subsidiaries operations thereon, has
resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in Environmental Liabilities
that would have or reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Battery Material Adverse Effect.



 

32 (d) There have been no releases of Hazardous Materials at any Real Property
currently or formerly owned or operated by Battery or any of its
Subsidiaries, which releases are reasonably likely to create any liability for
Cleanup or remediation under Environmental Laws, in each case except as,

likely to have a Battery Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 3.15 and except for the
representations and warranties in Section 3.4 and those relating to Battery

Subsidiaries make any representation or warranty regarding compliance or

and as is customary for the industries in which Battery and its Subsidiaries
operate, in each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Battery Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Battery nor its Subsidiaries are in breach or default under,
and neither Battery nor its Subsidiaries have taken any action or failed to
take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such
a breach or default, or permit termination or modification of, any insurance
policies, in each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Battery Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.17 _Foreign Corrupt Practices and International Trade Sanctions and
Ethical Practices_. To the knowledge of Battery, neither Battery, nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees or any other Persons acting on their behalf has, in connection with

entertainment, or made any unlawful expenditures relating to political
activity to government officials, candidates or members of political parties

funds in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended,
as if it were applicable to Battery or its Subsidiaries at that time, or any
other similar applicable Law, (b) paid, promised, accepted or received any

other transactions or series of similar transactions between Battery or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (a) any current or former officer or

(a) Neither RH nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or any other agreement with a labor union or labor
organization, nor is any such agreement presently being negotiated. Except as

which RH or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (ii) does not require any
notification to or consent by any labor union, labor organization or works
council.

Section 4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA_.

(a) Section 4.14(a) of the RH Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of each RH Benefit Plan. With respect to each RH Benefit

thereof, and, to the extent applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or
other funding instrument; (ii) the most recent determination letter, if
applicable; (iii) any summary plan description and summaries of material
modifications; and (iv) the most recent years Form 5500 and attached
schedules and audited financial statements, if any.



 

49 (b) Each RH Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualification and, to the knowledge of RH, no event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
qualification. Each RH Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be likely to have an RH Material Adverse
Effect. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by RH, any RH
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of RH that has not been satisfied in full
(other than with respect to amounts not yet due), except as, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have an RH
Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each Title IV Plan to which RH, any
RH Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of RH contributes or sponsors,
the present value of projected benefit obligations under such Title IV Plan
did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the
assets of such Title IV Plan allocable to such projected benefit obligations
by an amount in excess of $10,000,000. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of RH, threatened, material claims by or on behalf of any of RH
Benefit Plans, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any RH Benefit
Plan or otherwise involving any RH Benefit Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits), except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be likely to have an RH Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Neither RH nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has been obligated to
contribute during the preceding six years to any "multiemployer pension
plan," as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA.

(d) Section 4.14(d) of the RH Disclosure Schedule sets forth any medical or
death benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former
employees or directors of RH or any RH Subsidiary beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated solely by
applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee
pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) deferred
compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of RH or an RH
Subsidiary or (iv) benefits the full costs of which are borne by the current
or former employee or director or his or her beneficiary.

(e) Neither the negotiation or the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction by RH (alone or in conjunction with any other
event, including any termination of employment on or following the Effective
Time) will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of RH or any RH Subsidiary to any compensation or
benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits or trigger any other
material obligation under any RH Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, default under or limit RHs right to amend, modify or terminate
any RH Benefit Plan.



 

50 (f) Except with respect to individuals identified in Section 4.14(f) of the RH
Disclosure Schedule, no amount or other entitlement that could be received as
a result of the Transaction (alone or in conjunction with any other event) by
any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with
respect to RH will constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code); provided that, to the extent there is any
such payment, RH will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
shareholder approval that satisfies the requirements of 280G(b) of the Code.
No director, officer, employee or independent contractor of RH or any RH
Subsidiary is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason
of the Tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed on such
Person.

(g) With respect to each RH Benefit Plan established or maintained outside of
the U.S. primarily for the benefit of employees of RH or any RH Subsidiary
residing outside of the U.S. (a " _Foreign RH Benefit Plan_ "), except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had or would not be reasonably
likely to have an RH Material Adverse Effect: (i) all employer and employee
contributions to each Foreign RH Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms
of such Foreign RH Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued,
in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign RH Benefit Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Foreign RH Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book
reserve established for any Foreign RH Benefit Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in
such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign RH Benefit Plan and
no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; (iii) each
Foreign RH Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities; and
(iv) no contribution notice, financial support, direction or
restoration order under the U.K. Pensions Act 2004 has been issued to RH or
any of its affiliates in respect of the Russell Hobbs Limited Pension and Life
Assurance Plan (the " _U.K. Pension Plan_ "), and there is no circumstance
likely to give rise to any of the foregoing and the trustees of the U.K.
Pension Plan have not at any time entered into any agreement to reduce the
amount of any debt due (under Section 75 of the U.K. Pensions Act 1996) to the
U.K. Pension Plan.

currently or formerly operated or leased or other sites at which
Hazardous Materials were disposed of, or allegedly disposed of, or to which
RH or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be deemed to hold or have held

Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 4.15 and except for the

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Battery Solicitation_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m., prevailing Eastern time, on March 25, 2010 (the "
_Solicitation Termination Date_ "), Battery and its Representatives shall have
the right (acting through, or consistent with the recommendation of,
the Special Committee) to: (i) initiate, encourage, facilitate, solicit and
seek Alternative Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or other offers that may
lead to an Alternative Proposal), including by way of providing access to non-
public information (subject to entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with each recipient); _provided_ , that Battery shall promptly (and
in any event within 48 hours) provide to RH any non-public information
concerning Battery or its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to
any Person to the extent that such access was not previously provided or made
available to RH and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations
with respect to Alternative Proposals or any other proposals that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such requests,
proposals, discussions or negotiations.

(b) Subject to Section 6.1(d) and Section 6.1(e) from the Solicitation
Termination Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Battery shall not, and
shall not permit its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate, solicit
or seek (including in each case by way of furnishing non-public information or
assistance to any Person) any inquiries with respect to, or the making,
submission, announcement or implementation of, any proposal or other action
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Proposal, (ii) initiate, 



 

60  knowingly encourage, participate in or solicit any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (whether such discussions or negotiations are
initiated by Battery, any of its Representatives or a third party), other
than RH or any of its Representatives, regarding or in furtherance of such
inquiries or relating to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) provide any non-public
information, documentation or data to any Person, other than RH or any of its
Representatives, relating to an Alternative Proposal, (iv) otherwise cooperate
with or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make, implement or
accept any Alternative Proposal, (v) amend or grant any waiver or release
under any standstill agreement, confidentiality agreement or agreement
restricting a party from engaging in negotiations or discussions with Battery,
(vi) adopt or approve any Alternative Proposal, or propose the approval or
adoption of any Alternative Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such
action or (vii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to
lead to any Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement as set forth in the provisions of Section 6.1(d)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to Battery complying with Section 6.1(c), and
subject to the last two sentences of this Section 6.1(b), nothing contained in
this Section 6.1(b) shall prohibit Battery from taking any of the actions
described in clause (i) through (v) of this Section 6.1(b) with respect to any
Person who made a bona fide written Alternative Proposal received prior to the
Solicitation Termination Date with respect to which the requirements of
Section 6.1(d)(i) and Section 6.1(d)(iii) have, together with any other
Alternative Proposals contemplated by the proviso to the definition of
"Superior Proposal", been satisfied as of the Solicitation Termination Date
and thereafter continuously through the date of determination (any Person so
submitting such Alternative Proposal(s) and continuously meeting such
requirements, an " _Excluded Party_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
following the Solicitation Termination Date, an Excluded Party shall be deemed
to continuously meet such requirements, if, during the course of ongoing
negotiations, there is no period of greater than three (3)
continuous Business Days during which the Alternative Proposal submitted by
such Person, together with any other bona fide Alternative Proposals
contemplated by the proviso in the definition of a "Superior Proposal" with
respect to which discussions or negotiations remain active, shall fail to
satisfy the requirements of Section 6.1(d)(iii). Except with respect to any
Excluded Party, on the day following the Solicitation Termination Date,
Battery shall immediately cease and cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to terminate any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation or cooperation with or assistance or participation in, or
facilitation of any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted theretofore by Battery, its Subsidiaries or any of
its Representatives with respect to any Alternative Proposal and request and
instruct to be returned or destroyed all non-public information provided by or
on behalf of Battery or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.1 to the contrary, any Excluded
Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this
Agreement immediately at such time as such Alternative Proposal, together
with any other bona fide Alternative Proposals contemplated by the proviso in
the definition of a "Superior Proposal" with respect to which discussions or
negotiations remain active, made by such party is withdrawn, terminated,
expires or at any time fails to satisfy the requirements of Section
6.1(d)(iii) for a period of three (3) continuous Business Days. No party shall
be an Excluded Party unless the Battery Board (acting through, or
consistent with the recommendation of, the Special Committee) determines that
such party is an Excluded Party no later than the Solicitation Termination
Date.



 

61 (c) Within 48 hours after the Solicitation Termination Date, Battery shall
notify RH, in writing, of the identity of each Excluded Party, if any, and
provide RH a copy of each Alternative Proposal received from each Excluded
Party (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed written
description of such Alternative Proposal). From and after the Solicitation
Termination Date, Battery shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
notify RH in the event that Battery, its Subsidiaries or Representatives
receives any Alternative Proposal (including any material modifications
thereto or to any proposal made by an Excluded Party) or any request for non-
public information or any inquiry relating in any way to any Alternative
Proposal. Following the Solicitation Termination Date, Battery shall provide
RH with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making any such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and
shall promptly (and in any event no later than within 48 hours) advise RH of
any material development relating thereto. Battery has not entered into any
agreement prior to the date hereof, and will not enter into any agreement
following the date hereof, that would prevent Battery from providing such
information to RH.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(b), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Battery Stockholder Approval (i) Battery has received a written Alternative
Proposal from a third party that the Battery Board (acting through, or
consistent with the recommendation of, the Special Committee) believes in
good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Alternative Proposal did not result from
a breach of this Section 6.1 and (iii) the Battery Board (acting through, or
consistent with the recommendation of, the Special Committee) determines in
good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Alternative Proposal, together with any other bona fide
Alternative Proposals contemplated by the proviso in the definition of a
"Superior Proposal" with respect to which discussions or negotiations remain
active, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, then Battery may (A) furnish information with respect to Battery
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Alternative Proposal regarding such Alternative Proposal;  _provided_ , that
Battery (x) will not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries or Representatives
to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without first entering
or having entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person and (y) will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to RH
any non-public information concerning Battery or its Subsidiaries provided or
made available to such other Person which was not previously made available
to RH. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to obtaining the Battery Stockholder
Approval, Battery shall in any event be permitted to take the actions
described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any Excluded Party for
so long as such party remains an Excluded Party, and from and after obtaining
the Battery Stockholder Approval no Person shall be an Excluded Party.



 

62 (e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.1(b) to the contrary, (i) if a
material development or material change in circumstances, in each case, that
relates to Battery, RH or the transactions contemplated hereby, but does not
relate to any Alternative Proposal and which first becomes known to the
Battery Board after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Battery
Stockholder Approval (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (ii) if Battery receives
an Alternative Proposal which the Battery Board (acting through, or consistent
with the recommendation of, the Special Committee) concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by RH in accordance with
this Section 6.1(e), then, in each case, the Battery Board (acting through, or
consistent with the recommendation of, the Special Committee) may at any time
prior to obtaining the Battery Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that not taking such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Battery Board to
the Battery stockholders under applicable Law (A) withdraw, modify
or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to RH, the Battery Board Recommendation (a " _Board Recommendation
Change_ "), (B) only in the case of clause (ii) of this Section
6.1(e), approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, and/or (C) only in the
case of clause (ii) of this Section 6.1(e), terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant
to Section 8.1(e); _provided_ , _however_ , that Battery shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (C), and any purported
termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (C) shall be void and of no force
or effect, unless at or concurrently with such termination Battery pays the
Termination Fee and the Reimbursable Expenses in full and otherwise complies
with the provisions of Section 8.3; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither
the Battery Board nor the Special Committee may make a Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (A), approve or recommend any Superior
Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (C) unless (x), in the case of clauses (B)
and (C), such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by Battery of
this Section 6.1 and (y) in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (C):

(i) the Battery Board shall have first provided at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice (a " _Notice_ ") to RH that it is prepared to take
the applicable action in response to an Intervening Event or a Superior
Proposal, as applicable, which notice shall (i) describe such Intervening
Event or Superior Proposal, as applicable, in reasonable detail, and (ii) in
the case of a Superior Proposal, be accompanied by the most current version of
all relevant written agreements or proposals relating to the transaction that
constitute such Superior Proposal together with, in the case of an
Alternative Proposal that includes non-cash consideration, the value or range
of values attributed by the Battery Board in good faith to such non-cash
consideration after consultation with financial advisors; and 

(ii) RH does not make, within such three-Business Day period, a proposal that
would, in the good faith judgment of the Battery Board (acting through, or
consistent with the recommendation of, the Special Committee, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisors), cause the Alternative Proposal previously constituting a Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or the material
development or material change to no 



 

63  longer constitute an Intervening Event, as applicable, in each case, taking
into consideration any risk of non-consummation and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. Battery agrees that, during
the three-Business Day period prior to its effecting a Board Recommendation
Change or taking another action permitted by clause (B) or (C), Battery and
its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with RH and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereunder such that the Alternative Proposal in question no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. Each successive modification of any
Alternative Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes
of this Section 6.1(e).

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Battery or the Battery
Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Battery stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
Battery (other than a Board Recommendation Change, which may be made only in
accordance with Section 6.1(e)) if the Battery Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its legal counsel, that such disclosure is required by
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or an express rejection of any applicable Alternative Proposal
together with an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its
stockholders in favor of the Transaction and the Battery Merger shall be
deemed to be a Board Recommendation Change.

(g) In the event that Battery makes a Board Recommendation Change, it shall
promptly make a public announcement of such change and such announcement and
shall set forth the material reasons for such change.

Section 6.2 _RH Solicitation_. Except as provided in the Harbinger Support
Agreement or as set forth in Section 6.2 of the RH Disclosure Schedule, during
the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, RH shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) discuss, negotiate,
undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed
surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any Alternative
Proposal, (b) knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of
an Alternative Proposal, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person,
any information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets
of RH or its Subsidiaries in connection with an Alternative Proposal, (d)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing or (e) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement constituting or related to any Alternative Proposal. RH
shall, and shall cause its 



 

64  Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Alternative Proposal and shall demand the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection
therewith.

Section 6.3 _Preparation of SEC Documents_. As promptly as practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, (a) Parent, RH and Battery shall prepare and
file with the SEC the proxy statement/prospectus (as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") to be sent to the
stockholders of Battery relating to the meeting of Batterys stockholders (the
" _Battery Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider the approval of
the Battery Merger and (b) RH shall cause Parent to prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 or such other applicable form as
Battery and RH may agree (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Registration Statement_ "), in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Battery Merger. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, RH shall cause Parent to take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) to
be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers. Each of Parent,
Battery and RH shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by
the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. As
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become

Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as of the record date for
Battery Stockholders Meeting. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will made (in each case
including documents incorporated by reference therein) without providing
Battery, RH and Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to Battery, RH or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by Battery, RH or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
Battery. Battery or Parent, as applicable, will advise the other parties
hereto promptly after it receives any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as applicable,
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission.
Battery, RH and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts, after consultation with each other, to resolve all such requests or
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as
applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after 



 

65  receipt thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Battery, RH and Parent shall fully cooperate with each other in the
preparation of each of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and
each of RH, Parent and Battery shall, upon request, furnish Battery or Parent,
as applicable, with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the
requesting party may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as
applicable. Battery and Parent shall notify each other promptly of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

Section 6.4 _Battery Board Recommendation_. Subject to Section 6.1(e), the
Battery Board shall recommend that Batterys stockholders vote in favor of
approval of the matters described in Section 3.3(c) (the " _Battery Board
Recommendation_ ") and Battery, acting through the Board of Directors of
Battery, shall include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation, and shall
otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Battery Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , that, except as otherwise agreed in writing by Battery
and such parties; under no circumstances shall Batterys directors, officers
or stockholders be required to expend any personal funds (other than
reasonable business expenses reimbursable by Battery), incur any liabilities
or bring (or threaten to bring) any Action against a third party in order to
obtain Battery Stockholder Approval. This Section 6.4 shall not be
construed to require Battery to make any payment to any stockholder in
exchange for such stockholders vote in favor of the Transaction.

Section 6.5 _Battery Stockholder Meeting; RH Stockholder Approval_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is prepared and
Battery has mailed (or otherwise made electronically available) the Proxy
Statement to Batterys stockholders, Battery shall take, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Battery Organizational Documents, all action
reasonably necessary to convene the Battery Stockholders Meeting to consider
and vote upon the approval of the Transaction, to cause such vote to be taken
and to obtain the Battery Statutory Stockholder Approval and the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of Battery Common Stock (other than any
shares of Battery Common Stock beneficially owned by the Harbinger Parties)
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon (such approval together with the
Battery Statutory Stockholder Approval, the " _Battery Stockholder Approval_
").

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, RH shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law and the RH Organizational Documents, all action
reasonably necessary to obtain from its stockholders the RH Stockholder

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to applicable Law,
each of Battery and RH shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the other party and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other agents and representatives of such
other party (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), reasonable access at all
reasonable times during normal business hours on reasonable notice prior to
the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, personnel and records ( _provided_ that such access shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of such party)
and, during such period, each of Battery and RH shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 6.6(a) or
Section 6.6(b) shall require a party to provide any access, or to disclose any
information, if permitting such access or disclosing such information would
(i) violate applicable Law, (ii) violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality ( _provided_ that such party shall, upon the request of the
other party, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent
of any third party to such access or disclosure) or (iii) result in the loss
of attorney-client or similar privilege ( _provided_ that such party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). No review
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements
of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto under this Agreement.

(b) Each of RH, Battery and the Merger Subsidiaries shall hold, and shall
cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any non-public information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

publication of any press release or other public statement or any written
communications to investors, employees and vendors with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prohibit
any party from issuing or causing publication of any such press release or
public announcement to the extent that such disclosure (i) is required by
applicable Law, in which case the party making such determination will
use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other parties hereto reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance or
(ii) contains only information that has already been included in a prior
public statement made in accordance with this Section 6.6(c) and such party
has provided the other parties hereto with advance notice of such press
release or public announcement.

  

 

67 Section 6.7 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best

doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transaction and to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as

their reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties that are necessary to consummate the Transaction, (iv)
execute, deliver and perform any such additional instruments reasonably

as may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth
in this Section 6.7(a).

(b) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond at the
earliest practicable date to any requests for additional information made by
the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any

necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters. RH will

in effect, enter into and to cause Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of RH
or Battery, as the case may be, to enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the
Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to it and to Parent in such definitive agreements and to comply

definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment Letters. If any party becomes

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then that
party shall promptly notify each of the other parties, and each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and each of the other parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to assist the other parties in obtaining,
alternative financing from alternative financing sources on terms that are no
less favorable to RH, Battery and their respective Subsidiaries than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount that is adequate to pay
all fees and expenses and required debt repayments associated with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to make any other payments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Alternative Financing_ "). In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used

any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or of any condition therein not
likely to be satisfied, in each case, of which RH has knowledge or any
termination of any Debt Commitment Letter. RH shall keep Battery informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt
Financing. RH shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any Debt
Commitment Letter in any manner that would reasonably be expected to delay the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the Outside Date without
the prior written consent of Battery. For the avoidance of doubt, the
syndication of the Debt Financing (to the extent permitted by the Debt
Commitment Letters) shall be deemed not to violate RHs obligations under
this Agreement.

or otherwise prohibiting the Transaction, which Order or other action is final
and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party
which has not complied with its obligations under Section 6.7;

(iii) if the Battery Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the

at which the vote was taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available
to Battery if the failure to obtain the Battery Stockholder Approval shall
have been caused by the action or failure to act of Battery and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach by Battery of this Agreement;

(c) by Battery upon a breach or violation of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of an RH Party set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or violation would result in the failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) and in any such case,
such breach or violation shall be incapable of being cured by the

80 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become

(a) as set forth in Section 6.6(b), Section 6.8, the last sentence of Section
6.13(b), Section 8.3 and this Section 8.2, as well as Article IX to the extent
applicable to such surviving sections, each of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful and material breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant of such party contained herein prior to the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the aggregate liability of RH
for any such willful and material breach, together with the aggregate
liability of RH and/or any of its Affiliates under any other Transaction

amount equal to $50,000,000 (inclusive of the Reverse Termination Fee) and
(ii) the aggregate liability of Battery for any such willful and material
breach shall be limited to and shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount
equal to $50,000,000 (inclusive of the Termination Fee). No termination of
this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. For purposes of this
Section 8.2, a "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach of
this Agreement that is a consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to act
by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or a
failure to take such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a
material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to limit the rights of any party under Section
9.16 prior to the termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee and Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(a) Battery shall (i) pay a fee to RH in the amount of $1,000,000 and (ii)
reimburse RH and its Affiliates for their Reimbursable Expenses, up to an
aggregate cap of $10,000,000 (such collective amount, as the same may be
modified after giving effect to the immediately following proviso, if
applicable, the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (x) in
the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or
Section 8.1(f) in connection with a Non-Voting Superior Proposal, then the
Reimbursable Expenses of RH shall not be subject to a cap and shall be
reimbursed by Battery in full, and (y) in the event that (1) the Battery Board
makes a Board Recommendation Change prior to obtaining the
Battery Stockholder Approval, (2) a material reason for such Battery
Recommendation Change is a change in the expected cost or terms of the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters by reason of the flex or any of
the other terms thereof, (3) the Debt Commitment Letters are in effect at the
time the Battery Recommendation Change is made, (4) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), and (5) at the time of such
termination, Battery Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained, then
the Termination Fee shall be equal to the sum of (A) $10,000,000 plus (B) the
amount of the Reimbursable Expenses of RH and its Affiliates, up to an
aggregate cap in respect of Reimbursable Expenses of $10,000,000, if:

(i) Battery terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e); 

(ii) RH terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or



 

81 (iii) (A) Battery or RH terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii), (B) at the time of such termination (or, if applicable the
Battery Stockholder Meeting) an Alternative Proposal shall have been proposed
to the Battery Board or Special Committee or publicly announced and (C)
within 9 months following the date of such termination, Battery shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal or
an Alternative Proposal shall have been consummated; _provided_ , _however_
, that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section 8.3(a)(iii), the references
to "25%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "50%".

(b) RH shall (i) pay a fee to Battery in the amount of $1,000,000 and (ii)
reimburse Battery for its Reimbursable Expenses, up to an aggregate cap of
$10,000,000 (such collective amount, the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ "), if:

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall have been
satisfied or waived at the time of the termination of this Agreement, other
than the condition set forth in Section 7.1(f), and such other conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing; and

(ii) either Battery or RH terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.3(b), in no event
shall RH be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee if the failure of the
condition in Section 7.1(f) shall have been caused (in whole or in part) due
to the failure of the condition set forth as item 14 on Exhibit E to the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to the minimum amount of Availability (as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and, at such time, the aggregate amount
outstanding under the revolving Battery Credit Facility is in excess of
$116,000,000.

(c) Battery shall pay the Termination Fee and RHs Reimbursable Expenses by
wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) at or concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement as set forth in Section 6.1(e) in the case of
Section 8.3(a)(i), (ii) within two (2) Business Days following the termination
of this Agreement in the case of Section 8.3(a)(ii) and (iii) within two
Business Days of the event giving rise to the payment of the Termination Fee
and the Reimbursable Expenses in the case of Section 8.3(a)(iii). RH shall pay
the Reverse Termination Fee and Batterys Reimbursable Expenses by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (A) within two (2) Business Days
following a termination of this Agreement by Battery in connection with which
the Reverse Termination Fee is payable and (B) at or concurrently with a
termination of this Agreement by RH in connection with which the Reverse
Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment to be made
by any party under this Section 8.3 shall be payable only once to such other
party with respect to this Section 8.3 and not in duplication even though such
payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.



 

82 (d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by it
pursuant to this Section 8.3, interest shall accrue on such amount from the
date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 6% per annum. If, in order
to obtain such payment, a party commences a suit that results in judgment for
such party for such amount, the defaulting party or parties shall pay the
party which obtained such judgment its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit. Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of
the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee by RH or Battery specified in
this Section 8.3 is not a penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Battery or RH, as the case may be,
in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Battery further agrees
that (i) the maximum liability of Master Fund, directly or indirectly, shall
be limited to the express obligations of Master Fund under the Limited
Guarantee, (ii) in no event shall Battery, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates seek (and Battery shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to
seek) any monetary damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind in excess of the cap set forth in this Agreement or the Limited
Guarantee, in each case against or from RH or Master Fund, as applicable, and
(iii) in no event shall any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, representatives, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners or assignees of Battery, RH or of any of the Harbinger Parties
(collectively, " _Non-Recourse Parties_ ") have any other liability relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no party hereto, its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall seek (and such party shall cause
its controlled Affiliates not to seek) any monetary damages or any other
recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind against any of the Non-Recourse
Parties, and such party, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates shall be
precluded from any remedy against any of the Non-Recourse Parties at law or in
equity or otherwise.

100 Section 9.5 _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for
the purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall
apply:

(a) The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation hereof.

(b) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an article or a section,
paragraph, exhibit or schedule, such reference shall be to an article or a
section, paragraph, exhibit or schedule hereof unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary.

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

(d) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

(e) The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if."

(f) The meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be
equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term,
and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning.

 

(g) A reference to "$," "U.S. dollars" or "dollars" shall mean the legal
tender of the United States of America.

(h) A reference to any period of days shall be deemed to be to the relevant
number of calendar days, unless otherwise specified.

(i) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein.

(j) Unless otherwise defined, a reference to any accounting term shall have
the meaning as defined under GAAP.

(k) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto). In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions hereof.

(l) Any statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein.



 

101 Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, and all of which together will be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. For
purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures or signatures by other
electronic form of transfer shall be deemed originals, and the parties agree
to exchange original signatures as promptly as possible. 

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents (including the Confidentiality Agreement
and the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and except for, (i) at all times, the agreements for the benefit of
the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders set forth in Section 9.15 and (ii) after
the Effective Time, the rights of Batterys stockholders to receive the
Merger Consideration as specified in Section 2.1, the rights of Batterys and
Parents current directors and officers under Section 6.14, and the rights of
the Harbinger Parties to receive shares of Parent Common Stock under Section
6.19, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, the representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related thereto, the relationship of the parties,
and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the
parties, whether arising in Law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise,
shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules regarding conflicts
of Law to the extent that the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction
would be required thereby.

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement or the Transaction and obligations
arising hereunder brought by any other party 



 

102  hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or the Transaction in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this Section 9.10, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement or the
Transaction or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. This Section 9.10 is subject to Section 9.15.

Section 9.11 _Effect of Disclosure_. The disclosure of any matter in Battery
Disclosure Schedule or the RH Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be
deemed to constitute an admission by Battery or RH, respectively, or to
otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the purpose of this
Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without
materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the parties to this
Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transaction is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.13 _Waiver and Amendment; Remedies Cumulative_. Subject to
applicable Law, (a) any provision of this Agreement (other than Section
7.1(a)) or any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any of
the parties or compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
in this Agreement may be waived or (b) the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the parties here may be extended at any time
prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Battery may not take any
such action unless previously authorized by the Special Committee. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
party against whom waiver is sought; _provided_ , that any extension or
waiver given in compliance with this Section 9.13 or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a 



 

103  waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
Subject to applicable Law, any of the provisions of this Agreement (other than
Section 7.1(a) and the first sentence of this Section 9.13) may be amended at
any time, whether before or after the receipt of the Battery Stockholder
Approval, by the mutual written agreement of RH and Battery; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Battery may not take such action unless previously
authorized by the Special Committee and (ii) after the Battery Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, no such amendment shall be made which by law
requires further stockholder approval without such approval. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right.

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION OR THE ACTIONS OF RH, BATTERY OR ANY OF THE
MERGER SUBSIDIARIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.15 _Actions Related to the Debt Financing_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 9.10, the parties hereto agree (i) that any Action of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, involving the Lead Arrangers or any lender in the Debt
Financing (the " _Lenders_ ") or any Affiliate thereof arising out of or
relating to the Transaction, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters,
the related fee letter or the performance of services thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court sitting in
the City of New York (and the parties hereto will not bring or permit any of
their Affiliates to bring or support any other Person in bringing any such
Action in any other court), (ii) to waive any right to trial by jury
in respect of any such Action, (iii) that the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders
are beneficiaries of any liability cap or other limitation on remedies or
damages in this Agreement that are for the benefit of the RH Parties,
including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 8.2, Section 8.3(b)
and Section 9.16(b) and (iv) the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders (and their
affiliates) are express third party beneficiaries of the foregoing provisions.

Section 9.16 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by any party. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches and/or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled to at
Law or in equity.



 

104 (b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or injunctive
relief pursuant to this Section 9.16(a) and subject to the limitation
contained in the last sentence of this Section 9.16(b), each party may pursue
any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including monetary
damages; _provided_ , that, it is understood and agreed that claims for
monetary damages following termination of this Agreement shall be subject to
the limitations contained in Sections 8.2 and 8.3(b). Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, no party hereto shall be permitted to make any
claim or commence any Action seeking monetary damages against any other party
hereto in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to the
right of any party to seek such monetary damages following such termination in
accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this
Agreement. 

Section 9.17 _Other Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or otherwise, there shall be no recovery pursuant
to this Agreement by any party for any punitive, exemplary, consequential,
incidental, treble, special, or other similar damages (other than those
actually paid in connection with a third party claim) in any claim or
proceeding by one party against another arising out of or relating to a breach
or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement
under this Agreement by the other party.
