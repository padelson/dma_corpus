                                THE TRANSACTIONS

         2.01      THE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP MERGER.

                  (a) THE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP MERGER. Upon the terms and subject
         to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Public
         Partnership Effective Time, Public Partnership Merger Sub shall be
         merged with and into Public Partnership and the separate partnership
         existence of Public Partnership Merger Sub shall thereupon cease (the
         "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP MERGER"). Public Partnership shall be the surviving
         entity in the Public Partnership Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred
         to as the "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP SURVIVING PARTNERSHIP"), and the separate
         partnership existence of Public Partnership, with all its rights,
         privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
         unaffected by the Public Partnership Merger, except as set forth in
         Section 2.01(c). The Public Partnership Merger shall have the effects
         specified in Section 17-211(h) of the DE Partnership Law.

                  (b) PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP EFFECTIVE TIME. On the Closing Date,
         immediately following the satisfaction of all the conditions set forth
         in Article V, Public Partnership and Public Partnership Merger Sub
         shall cause a certificate of merger (the "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP
         CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
         Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in Section 17-211(c) of the
         DE Partnership Law. The Public Partnership Merger shall become
         effective at the time on the Closing Date specified in the Public
         Partnership Certificate of Merger (the "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP EFFECTIVE
         TIME").

                  (c) THE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP SURVIVING PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.
         Effective as of the Public Partnership Effective Time, the Public
         Partnership Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated in its
         entirety and a new partnership agreement shall be adopted which limited
         partnership agreement shall be in a form to be determined by Buyer
         prior to the Closing.

                  (d) EFFECT ON PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS. At the Public Partnership
         Effective Time, as a result of the Public Partnership Merger and
         without any action on the part of the holders of any partnership
         interest in Public Partnership:

                           (i) PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP MERGER CONSIDERATION. Each
                  unit of limited partner interest in Public Partnership issued
                  and outstanding immediately prior to the Public Partnership
                  Effective Time (a "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP LP UNIT"), shall be
                  converted into the right to receive, without interest, an
                  amount in cash equal to $40.00 (such amount, as it may be
                  adjusted in accordance with this Section 2.01(d)(i), the "UNIT
                  PRICE"), PROVIDED that:

                                    (x) in the event that the Revenue Run-Rate
                           as of the most recent calendar month-end prior to the
                           Closing Date (the "CLOSING REVENUE RUN-RATE") is less
                           than 90% of the Revenue Run-Rate as of the Base Date

                           the Unit Price multiplied by the Shortfall Ratio; and

                                    (y) in the event that the Closing Revenue
                           Run-Rate is less than 85% of the Base Revenue
                           Run-Rate, then the Unit Price shall be reduced by an
                           amount equal to the sum of (A) the Unit Price
                           multiplied by the Shortfall Ratio and (B) the Unit
                           Price multiplied by the Additional Shortfall Ratio.

                           PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Unit Price as so adjusted
                           shall not be less than $34.00.

                                    The "SHORTFALL RATIO" shall be equal to the
                           excess of (i) 90% over (ii) a fraction (expressed as
                           a percentage) the numerator of which is the Closing
                           Revenue Run-Rate and the denominator of which is the
                           Base Revenue Run-Rate.

                                    The "ADDITIONAL SHORTFALL RATIO" shall be
                           equal to the excess of (i) 85% over (ii) a fraction
                           (expressed as a percentage) the numerator of which is
                           the Closing Revenue Run-Rate and the denominator of
                           which is the Base Revenue Run-Rate.

                                    "REVENUE RUN-RATE" shall mean, as of any
                           date, the aggregate annualized investment advisory,

                           such Subsidiaries, determined by multiplying the
                           Adjusted Assets Under Management for each such
                           account by the applicable fee rate for such account
                           at such date (excluding any performance-based fees)
                           or, with respect to calculating the Closing Revenue
                           Run-Rate, in the case of any Registered Investment

                           such modified fee rate to be in effect for such
                           account immediately following the Closing. The
                           calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate shall be
                           made using

                           substantially the same methodology as the calculation
                           of the Base Revenue Run-Rate.

                           particular date, the amount of assets under
                           management by the Subsidiaries of Private Partnership
                           in that account as of the Base Date, as adjusted, in
                           the case of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate, (i) to
                           reflect net cash flows (additions, withdrawals and
                           reinvestments), new accounts and terminated accounts

                           fluctuations from and after the Base Date.

                  For purposes of calculating the Base Revenue Run-Rate and the
                  Closing Revenue Run-Rate, all accounts of the Clients
                  Previously Disclosed in section 2.01(d)(i) of the General
                  Partner's Disclosure Schedules shall be excluded.

                  Effective Time (a "PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP GP UNIT") shall be
                  converted into the right to receive, without interest, an
                  amount in cash equal to the Unit Price.

                           (iii) CANCELLATIONS OF UNITS, ETC. All such Public
                  Partnership LP Units and all such Public Partnership GP Units

                  each holder of a certificate representing any such Public
                  Partnership Units shall thereafter cease to have any rights
                  with respect to such Public Partnership Units, except the
                  right to receive the Unit Price for each Public Partnership
                  Unit upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with

         hereinafter referred to as the "PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SURVIVING

                  Effective Time (a "PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP LP UNIT") shall be
                  converted into the right to receive, without interest, an

                  immediately prior to the Private Partnership Effective Time (a

                  the Unit Price.

                           (iii) CANCELLATIONS OF UNITS, ETC. All such Private

         Surviving Partnership, and the general partner interest in Private

                  the Private Partnership Effective Time ("PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP
                  UNITHOLDERS").

                  to look to Private Partnership Surviving Partnership only as
                  general creditors thereof with respect to the cash payable
                  upon due surrender of such certificates. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party hereto shall
                  be liable to Private Partnership Unitholders for any amount
                  paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned

exercisable immediately prior to the Closing, and (y) be canceled as of the
Closing and thereafter represent the right to receive at the Closing, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, from Private Partnership Surviving Partnership in

subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) that are to be
fulfilled or waived shall have been fulfilled or waived in accordance with this

month), PROVIDED that, in the sole discretion of General Partner,

                                    (A) the Closing may be delayed in order to
                           permit the Sellers to obtain Client consents
                           (PROVIDED that such consents are reasonably expected
                           to be obtained within 45 days of when the Closing
                           would otherwise occur and PROVIDED FURTHER, that
                           Closing may not be delayed beyond the Termination
                           Date) in order to avoid or mitigate the adjustment to
                           the Unit Price set forth in the first proviso of
                           Section 2.01(d)(i), and

                           business day (or on such other date permitted by
                           clause (A) of this Section 2.04(i)), PROVIDED that to
                           the extent that the Unit Price will be adjusted
                           pursuant to the first proviso of Section 2.01(d)(i)
                           solely as a result of the failure of the applicable
                           Subsidiary of Private Partnership to obtain the
                           consent of one or more Registered Investment
                           Companies in accordance with Section 4.04(c) due to

                           notwithstanding any other term or provision of this
                           Article II, (1) the Buyer shall pay the amount of
                           such adjustment into an escrow account (the "ESCROW

                           financial institution with customary terms to be
                           agreed upon by General Partner and Buyer, (2) if any
                           such consent or consents are obtained in accordance
                           with Section 4.04(c) within the period permitted by

                           Person who was entitled to receive payments under
                           this Article II shall be promptly paid the excess of
                           (x) the amount such Person would have been paid under
                           this Article II (without regard to any required
                           withholding tax) had all such consents received at or
                           prior to such time from such consenting Registered

                           Person pursuant to this Article II, plus earnings on

                           withholding and (3) upon the termination of such
                           period, any amount remaining in such

representation or warranty (or such other representation or warranty to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such
other representation or warranty) made pursuant to Section 3.03 or 3.04, as the
case may be; PROVIDED that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by a Party that such item represents such an exception or that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
such Party.

         3.02     STANDARDS. For purposes of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 3.03 and 3.04, no representation or warranty contained in

         regard to any qualification as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect,
         substantially or other words of qualification set forth in such
         representations and warranties), such fact, circumstance or event would
         cause any such representation and warranty to fail to be true and
         correct in any material respect; and

                  (b) in the case of each other representation and warranty
         contained in Section 3.03 and Section 3.04 (other than Section 3.03(d))
         (without regard to any qualification as to materiality, Material
         Adverse Effect, substantially or other words of qualification set forth

                                       32

<PAGE>


                  modifications or changes to Compensation and Benefit Plans
                  existing as of the date hereof only), neither Public
                  Partnership, Private Partnership nor any of their respective
                  Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional
                  Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any
                  existing material Compensation and Benefit Plan;

                           (ii) each such Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
                  operated and administered substantially in accordance with its
                  terms and in substantial compliance with Applicable Law,
                  including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, and any
                  regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings,
                  disclosures and notices required by ERISA and the Code, or any
                  other Applicable Law have been timely made. Each such
                  Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a Pension Plan and
                  which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
                  Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
                  IRS, and the Sellers are not aware of any circumstances likely
                  to result in revocation of any such favorable determination
                  letter from the IRS. No circumstances exist that are likely to
                  materially adversely affect the qualified status of any
                  material Compensation and Benefit Plan or the related trust.
                  To the knowledge of the Sellers, there is no pending or, to
                  their knowledge, threatened legal action, suit or claim
                  relating to such Compensation and Benefit Plans, other than
                  routine claims for benefits. None of Public Partnership,
                  Private Partnership nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
                  has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action,
                  with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that could
                  reasonably be expected to subject any of them, any such Plan
                  or any fiduciary thereof to a tax or penalty imposed by either
                  Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA in an amount
                  that would be material, assuming for purposes of Section 4975
                  of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction
                  expired as of the date hereof;

                           (iii) except as Previously Disclosed, neither Public
                  Partnership nor Private Partnership nor any of their
                  respective Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has ever
                  maintained any Pension Plan subject to Title IV or Section 302
                  of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code;

                           (iv) except as Previously Disclosed, with respect to
                  each Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan
                  subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or
                  4971 of the Code and each Pension Plan maintained by an ERISA
                  Affiliate of Public Partnership or Private Partnership: (1)
                  there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency
                  within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
                  of ERISA, whether or not waived; (2) the fair market value of
                  the assets of such Compensation and Benefit Plan equals or
                  exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits
                  under such Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the
                  actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent
                  actuarial report for such Plan; (3) no reportable event within
                  the meaning of


                                       33

                  Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice

                  been timely paid in full; (5) no liability (other than for
                  premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
                  expected to be incurred by Private Partnership, Public
                  Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries; and (6)
                  the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such
                  Plan and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no condition exists that
                  presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or
                  which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
                  the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee of
                  administer, any such Plan;

                           (v) no Compensation and Benefit Plan is a
                  "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3)
                  of ERISA ("MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a plan that has two or more
                  contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
                  common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA
                  ("MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). None of Public Partnership,

                  ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
                  contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
                  Multiemployer Plan;

                           (vi) there does not now exist, nor do any
                  circumstances exist that could result in, any liability (1)
                  under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA, (2) under sections 412
                  and 4971 of the Code, (3) as a result of a failure to comply
                  with the continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et
                  seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, and (4) under
                  corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws or
                  regulations, that would be a liability of Public Partnership,
                  Private Partnership or their respective Subsidiaries following
                  the Closing;

                           (vii) all contributions required to be made by the
                  Public Partnership or Private Partnership or their respective

         note, bond, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness to, any Person,
         or any other note, bond, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness of
         Public Partnership or Private Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries,
         in each case in excess of $5,000,000 individually and $15,000,000 in
         the aggregate; (viii) that is any material currency exchange, interest
         rate exchange, commodity exchange or similar contract; (ix) that is a
         contract for any material joint venture or similar arrangement; or (x)
         that is a contract that includes any noncompetition or nonsolicitation
         covenant or any exclusive dealing or similar arrangement that limits to
         any material extent the freedom of Public Partnership, Private
         Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries to compete (geographically or
         otherwise) in any line of business or will, after the Closing, so limit
         competition by the Public Partnership Surviving Partnership, Private
         Partnership Surviving Partnership or their Subsidiaries (collectively,
         the "SELLER MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). Each of the Seller Material Contracts
         is valid, binding, in full force and effect, and is enforceable against
         Public Partnership, Private Partnership and/or their Subsidiaries, as
         the case may be, in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof,
         neither Public Partnership, Private Partnership nor any of their
         Subsidiaries has received written or oral notice of cancellation of or
         default under or intent to cancel or call a default under any of the
         Seller Material Contracts. Public Partnership, Private Partnership and
         each of its Subsidiaries has performed all material obligations
         required to be performed by it to date under the Seller Material
         Contracts, and to Sellers' knowledge there exists no event or condition
         which (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would be a
         breach or a default on the part of Public Partnership, Private
         Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries or on the part of the other
         party to such Seller Material Contracts.

                  (r) INSURANCE. Each insurance policy (including insurance
         policies and fidelity bonds relating to the Sponsored Investment
         Companies, and the assets, properties and employees of the Sellers and
         their Subsidiaries) and bond of the Sellers and their Subsidiaries is
         in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have
         been paid and none of the Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries has
         received written notice from any insurer or agent of any intent to
         cancel any such insurance policy or bond.

                  (s) TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each of the Sellers
         and their Subsidiaries and the Sponsored Investment Companies has (and
         upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will have)
         ownership of, or such other rights by license, lease or other agreement
         in and to, all intellectual property necessary to conduct the business
         of the Private Partnership and its Subsidiaries and the Sponsored
         Investment Companies substantially in the manner presently conducted,
         and the consummation of the Transactions as contemplated hereby does
         not and will not conflict with, alter or impair any such ownership or
         rights. None of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates has granted
         any option or license of any kind to any third party relating to any
         technology or intellectual property owned, used, filed by or licensed
         to the Sellers or their Subsidiaries (and used in conducting the
         business of such entity) or the marketing or distribution thereof. All
         such material technology has been maintained in confidence in
         accordance


                                       41

<PAGE>


         with protection procedures customarily used in the industry to protect
         rights of like importance. None of the Sellers, their Subsidiaries or
         the Sponsored Investment Companies has, to the Seller's knowledge,
         infringed or violated any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent,
         trade secret right or other proprietary right of others, nor, to the
         Sellers' knowledge, has any other Person infringed on a continuing
         basis any rights that the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries has in
         the intellectual property. Each of the Sellers, their Subsidiaries and
         the Sponsored Investment Companies owns or licenses all computer
         software developed or currently used by it which is material to the
         conduct of its business as currently conducted and has the right to use
         such software without infringing upon the intellectual property rights
         (including trade secrets rights) of any third party. None of the
         Sellers, any of their Subsidiaries or any of the Sponsored Investment
         Companies has received notice of any claim respecting any such
         violation or infringement.

                  (t) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Sellers and their Subsidiaries
         have complied in all material respects with all applicable
         Environmental Laws, and none of the Sellers or any of their
         Subsidiaries is subject to any actual or, to the knowledge of the
         Sellers, threatened investigation, claim or liability under any
         Environmental Law. "Environmental Law" means (i) any federal, state,
         foreign or local law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, code,
         license, permit, authorization, approval, consent, common law, legal
         doctrine, order, judgment, decree, injunction, requirement or agreement
         with any governmental entity, (x) relating to the protection,
         preservation or restoration of the environment (including, without
         limitation, air, water, vapor, surface water, groundwater, drinking
         water supply, surface land, subsurface land, plant and animal life or
         any other natural resource), or to human health or safety, or (y) the
         exposure to, or the use, storage, recycling, treatment, generation,
         transportation, processing, handling, labeling, production, release or
         disposal of Hazardous Substances (as hereinafter defined), in each case
         as amended and as now in effect. "Hazardous Substance" means any
         substance presently listed, defined, designated or classified as
         hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous, or otherwise regulated,
         under any Environmental Law, whether by type or by quantity, including
         any substance containing any such substance as a component.

         board of directors of General Partner its opinion, dated the date
         hereof, accompanied by an authorization to include such opinion in the
         Proxy Statement to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement,
         the Unit Price is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
         of Private Partnership Unitholders and Public Partnership Unitholders.

                  (v) ANNUALIZED ADVISORY FEE REVENUES. The aggregate annualized
investment advisory, investment management and subadvisory fees for all
investment management accounts managed by the Subsidiaries of Private
Partnership or by CGM and payable to such Persons (excluding such fees from

any Equity Interests in, any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL")
or directly or indirectly engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide
any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prevent any Seller
or its managing member, general partner or management board from (A) in the
case of Public Partnership or its management board or representatives,
complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal or providing any other legally required disclosure to
the partners of Private Partnership and Public Partnership; (B) providing
information to, or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, any
Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (i)
if the board of directors of the General Partner, determines, in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that providing such
information and engaging in such discussions or negotiations is


                                       47

required to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law
and (ii) if, prior to furnishing any non-public information to any
such party, Private Partnership and/or Public Partnership, as
applicable, shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement on
customary terms as advised by outside legal counsel; or (C)
recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the members, partners
or unitholders of such Seller and withdrawing the prior
recommendation of this Agreement, if and only to the extent that,
in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the board
of directors of the General Partner, determines, in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that taking such
action is required to comply with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law (any such Acquisition Proposal, a "SUPERIOR
PROPOSAL"). Each Seller agrees that it will notify Buyer Parent and
Buyer promptly (within twenty-four hours of receipt) if any such
inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of
its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Buyer Parent and
Buyer reasonably informed on the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. Each such Seller shall, and shall cause each
Subsidiary and each of such Sellers' and Subsidiaries' employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant) to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties other than
Buyer Parent and Buyer with respect to any of the foregoing.

         4.03 RETENTION AND OTHER COMPENSATION RELATED MATTERS. Prior to the
Closing, Private Partnership shall implement an employee retention plan
containing terms and provisions set forth on Exhibit A hereto. Buyer Parent
agrees that it shall cause Private Partnership Surviving Partnership to honor
the terms of such retention plan following the Closing and that it shall, or
shall cause Private Partnership Surviving Partnership to, make available the
funds that are necessary to make the payments under such retention plan.

         4.04 FILINGS, OTHER ACTIONS; NOTIFICATION.

                  (a) Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each
         other and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their
         respective reasonable best efforts to, and propose to the Sponsored
         Investment Companies that they take or cause to be taken all actions,
         and do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable on
         its part under the Transaction Documents and Applicable Law to
         consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as practicable,
         including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
         documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other
         filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
         registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
         advisable to be obtained from any third party and any Authority in
         order to consummate the Transactions. Subject to Applicable Laws
         relating to the exchange of information, Buyer Parent, Buyer, Private
         Partnership, Public Partnership and General Partner shall, to the
         extent practicable, consult the other on and


                                       48

<PAGE>

         obtain consent with respect to all the information relating to Buyer
         Parent, Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, and any of their
         respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or
         written materials submitted to, any Authority or third party in
         connection with the Transactions and the parties hereto shall
         cooperate in such efforts. In exercising the foregoing right, Buyer
         Parent, Buyer and the Sellers shall act reasonably and as promptly
         as reasonably practicable.

                  (b) Buyer Parent, Buyer and each of the Sellers shall, upon
         request by another Party, cooperate with and furnish to such Party all
         information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, general partners,
         members, directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as
         may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
         statement, filing, notice or application required to be made by or on
         behalf of any of Buyer Parent, Buyer, the Sellers, or any of their
         respective Subsidiaries to any Authority in connection with the
         Transactions.

                  (c) To the extent that the rights of any Seller or any
         Subsidiary thereof under any agreement, including any Advisory
         Agreement, may not be assigned by operation of law or the terms of the
         applicable agreement without the consent or approval of another party
         thereto or terminates upon any such assignment, each of the Sellers
         shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cause its
         Subsidiaries, if any, to obtain, any such consent in accordance with
         this Section 4.04(c) and Section 4.06. Without limiting the generality
         of the foregoing, Private Partnership and each of General Partner and
         Public Partnership, as general partners of Private Partnership, as
         promptly as practicable shall (i) use, and use its reasonable best
         efforts to cause each Registered Investment Company to use, its
         reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the
         approval of the Investment Company Boards and the shareholders of such
         Registered Investment Company, pursuant to the provisions of Section 15
         of the Investment Company Act applicable thereto, of a new Advisory
         Agreement for such Registered Investment Company with the applicable
         Subsidiary of Private Partnership serving as adviser or subadviser to
         such Registered Investment Company, such agreement containing terms
         (other than fee rates) that are not materially less favorable to such
         Subsidiary than terms contained in the Advisory Agreement existing on
         the date hereof and becoming effective upon the Closing, (ii) use its
         reasonable best efforts to cause each Registered Investment Company to
         prepare, file with and cause to be cleared by the SEC and all other
         Authorities having jurisdiction thereover, as promptly as practicable
         after the date hereof, all proxy solicitation materials required to be
         distributed to shareholders of the Registered Investment Companies with
         respect to the actions recommended for shareholder approval by the
         Investment Company Boards and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
         cause each Registered Investment Company to mail such proxy
         solicitation materials to such shareholders promptly after clearance by
         the SEC and cause to be submitted to a meeting of shareholders of such
         Registered Investment Company as soon as practicable after such mailing
         the proposals described in clause (ii) above, all such consents and
         such proxy



                                       49

<PAGE>


         solicitation, to be in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to Buyer and in compliance with Section 3.03(o).

         Each of (i) the proxy solicitation materials to be distributed to
         the shareholders of each Registered Investment Company in connection
         with the approvals described in Section 4.04 of this Agreement and
         (ii) the materials provided or to be provided to the applicable
         Investment Company Boards in connection with the approvals required
         in connection with this Agreement have provided or will provide all
         information necessary in order to make the disclosure of information
         therein satisfy the requirements of all Applicable Law (including
         Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Sections 15, 20 and 36(b) of the
         Investment Company Act) in all material respects (except to the
         extent that information supplied by or on behalf of Buyer Parent or
         its Subsidiaries was incomplete) and such materials and information
         (except to the extent supplied by or on behalf of Buyer Parent or
         its Subsidiaries) will be complete in all material respects and will
         not contain (at the time such materials or information are
         distributed, filed or provided, as the case may be) any statement
         which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which
         it is made, is false or misleading in any material respect, and will
         not omit to state any fact necessary in order to make the statements
         therein not false or misleading in any material respect or (with
         respect to information included in proxy statements) necessary to
         correct any statement or any earlier communication with respect to
         the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter
         which has become false or misleading in any material respect.

         4.05 INVESTMENT COMPANY MATTERS.

                  (a) Buyer Parent and the Buyer acknowledge that each of the
         Sellers has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the benefits
         and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
         Act. Each of Buyer Parent and the Buyer shall not take, and each of
         them shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to
         take, any action not contemplated by this Agreement that would have the
         effect, directly and indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of
         the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be
         met in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions, and each of them
         shall not fail to take, and, after the Closing, shall use reasonable
         best efforts to cause each Affiliate of the Buyer Parent to not fail to
         take, any action if the failure to take such action would have the
         effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of
         the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be
         met in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions. In that regard,
         each of Buyer Parent and the Buyer shall conduct its business and
         shall, subject to the applicable fiduciary duties to the Sponsored
         Registered Investment Companies, use its reasonable best efforts to
         cause each of its Affiliates to conduct its business so as to assure
         that, insofar as within the control of Buyer Parent, the Buyer or their
         respective Affiliates:


                                       50
<PAGE>

                           (i) for a period of three years after the Closing, at
                  least 75% of the members of the Investment Company Boards of
                  each Sponsored Registered Investment Company are not (A)
                  "interested persons" of the investment adviser of such
                  Sponsored Registered Investment Company after the Closing, or
                  (B) "interested persons" of the present investment manager of
                  such Sponsored Registered Investment Company; and

                           (ii) for a period of two years after the Closing,
                  there shall not be imposed on any Sponsored Registered
                  Investment Company an "unfair burden" as a result of the
                  Transactions, or any terms, conditions or understandings
                  applicable thereto;

         PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Buyer Parent, Buyer or any of their
         Affiliates shall have obtained an order from the SEC exempting it from
         the provisions of Section 15(f), while still maintaining the "safe
         harbor" provided by Section 15(f), then this covenant shall be deemed
         to be modified to the extent necessary to permit Buyer Parent, Buyer
         and their Affiliates to act in a manner consistent with such SEC
         exemptive order.

                  (b) For a period of three years from the Closing, neither
         Buyer Parent nor Buyer shall, and Buyer Parent and Buyer shall use
         reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Affiliates not to,
         voluntarily engage in any transaction that would constitute an
         "assignment" of any Advisory Agreement with any Sponsored Registered
         Investment Company currently managed by any Private Partnership or its
         Subsidiaries to which Buyer Parent, the Buyer or any such Affiliate is
         a party, without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects
         the same as that contained in this Section 4.05. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained herein, the covenants of the Parties
         contained in this Section 4.05 are intended only for the benefit of the
         Parties and holders of their respective Equity Interests immediately
         prior to the Closing and for no other Person.

                  (c) The terms used in quotations in this Section 4.05 shall
         have the meanings set forth in Sections 2(a)(4), 2(a)(19) and 15(f) of
         the Investment Company Act.

                  4.06 ADVISORY AGREEMENTS. If consent to the assignment or
         deemed assignment of an Advisory Agreement with Clients of Private
         Partnership or its Subsidiaries (other than Clients that are Registered
         Investment Companies) as a result of the Transactions is required by
         Applicable Law or by such Clients' Advisory Agreement, as soon as
         reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Private Partnership
         shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, send a notice (the
         "NOTICE") informing such Clients of the Transactions, requesting
         written consent to the assignment of such Client's Advisory Agreement
         and informing such Client: (a) of the intention to complete the
         Transactions, which will result in a deemed assignment of such Advisory
         Agreement; (b) of Private Partnership's or its Subsidiaries' intention
         to continue to provide the advisory services

                                       51
<PAGE>



         pursuant to the existing Advisory Agreement with such Client after
         the Closing; and (c) that the consent of such Client will be deemed
         to have been granted if such client continues to accept such
         advisory services for a period of at least forty-five (45) days
         after the sending of the Notice without termination. Buyer agrees
         that consent for any Advisory Agreement with a Client (other than
         Clients that are Registered Investment Companies) to the assignment
         or deemed assignment resulting from the Transactions shall be deemed
         given for all purposes hereunder (i) if no consent is required under
         Applicable Law or the respective Advisory Agreement, (ii) upon receipt
         of the written consent requested in the Notice or (iii) if such consent
         is required under Applicable Law or the respective Advisory Agreement,
         and if the written consent requested in any Notice is not received
         within forty-five (45) days of mailing the Notice to a Client, to the
         extent permissible under Applicable Law and the applicable Advisory
         Agreement (provided, that such Client shall not have affirmatively
         stated to any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates that it does
         not so consent or terminated its respective Advisory Agreement prior to
         the Closing) (the "NEGATIVE CONSENT PROCEDURE"). Buyer shall be
         provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such consent materials
         to be used by Private Partnership and such Subsidiaries prior to
         distribution. Private Partnership and such Subsidiaries shall make
         available to Buyer copies of any and all substantive correspondence
         between them and Clients or representatives or counsel of such Clients
         relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this Section 4.06.
         Prior to the Private Partnership Effective Time, neither Buyer Parent,
         nor Buyer, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall contact, in
         writing or otherwise, any Client or any other Person who acts as an
         adviser to or "gatekeeper" for any Client without the prior written
         approval of General Partner.

         4.07 TAXATION.

                  (a) From and after the Closing Date, all Tax examinations,
         audits and contests relating to periods or partial periods ending prior
         to or on the Closing Date relating to Private Partnership or any of its
         Subsidiaries (other than the Corporate Subsidiaries) or Public
         Partnership (such entities, the "ACQUIRED ENTITIES"), shall be
         controlled by Seller Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any settlement
         of any such examination, audit or contest would materially and
         adversely impact a Tax return or Tax position of Buyer or any of its
         Subsidiaries with respect to a period or partial period beginning on or
         after the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall not enter into such
         settlement without the consent of Buyer which shall not be unreasonably
         withheld.

                  (b) Public Partnership and Private Partnership will prepare
         and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns that
         include the business and operations of the Acquired Entities for any
         period or partial period ending prior to or on the Closing Date,
         subject to prior approval by Seller Parent.

                                       52
<PAGE>

                  (c) Each of the Acquired Entities (other than the Corporate
         Subsidiaries and any Subsidiary of Private Partnership that is a
         disregarded entity for United States federal income Tax purposes) shall
         make an election, or, if an election has previously been made, continue
         such election in effect, under Section 754 of the Code and any
         comparable provision of any other Tax law for the year in which the
         Closing occurs.

         4.08 ACCESS; INFORMATION.

                  (a) Each of General Partner, Public Partnership and Private
         Partnership agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
         Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall
         afford or cause its Subsidiaries to afford Buyer Parent, Buyer and the
         officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, accountants
         and other authorized representatives of Buyer Parent and Buyer
         (collectively, the "BUYER REPRESENTATIVES"), such access throughout the
         period prior to the Closing to the books, records (including, without
         limitation, any Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors),
         offices, properties and personnel of such Person, its Subsidiaries and
         any Sponsored Investment Company and to such other information as Buyer
         may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall promptly
         furnish or make available to Buyer Parent and Buyer and, at the request
         of Buyer Parent or Buyer, to any Buyer Representatives (i) a copy of
         each report, schedule and other document filed by it or its
         Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
         securities laws, and (ii) all other financial and operating data and
         other information concerning the business, properties, assets and
         personnel of it and its Subsidiaries as Buyer Representative may
         reasonably request. Promptly following the date hereof, General Partner
         shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide its calculation of the
         Base Revenue Run-Rate, together with supporting details, to Buyer
         Parent.

                  (b) The provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated as
         of May 12, 2000, among Public Partnership, Private Partnership, Seller
         Parent and Buyer Parent shall survive the execution of this Agreement
         and shall apply with respect to all information made available to Buyer
         Representatives pursuant to this Section 4.08.

         4.09 PUBLICITY. The Parties hereby confirm that they have consented to
the initial press releases announcing the execution of this Agreement to be
released jointly by Public Partnership, Private Partnership and Buyer Parent and
separately by Seller Parent. No Party hereto will issue, and each Party will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to issue, any additional
press release or otherwise make any additional public announcement with respect
to the Transactions without the prior consent of the other Parties, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as and to the extent that
such Party or any of its Affiliates determines in good faith that it is so
obligated by Applicable Law, in which case such Party shall consult, to the
extent practicable, with the other Parties prior to issuing such press release
or making such public announcement.

         4.10 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to any of the Transactions, each of the Sellers and their respective
boards of directors, general partners, managing members or managing boards, as
applicable, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and otherwise act to eliminate

be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
Applicable Laws, so as to fulfill all conditions and obligations on its part to

after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it must not make such
recommendation and/or must withdraw any prior recommendation in connection with
the Public Partnership Merger, if it is to comply with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law), and Public Partnership and Private Partnership shall take
all reasonable, lawful action to solicit, such approval by Public Partnership
Unitholders and by Private Partnership Unitholders.

         4.16 PROXY STATEMENT. (a) Each of the Sellers shall cooperate with
Public Partnership to, and Public Partnership shall, prepare a proxy statement
to be filed by Public Partnership with the SEC in connection with the Public
Partnership Merger (including all other proxy solicitation materials of Public
Partnership, the "PROXY STATEMENT"). Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate,
and to cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other, its counsel and its
accountants, in preparation of the Proxy Statement; and, promptly after
clearance by the SEC, Public Partnership shall mail the Proxy Statement to the
Public Partnership Unitholders.

                  (b) Each of the Parties agrees, as to itself and its
         Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
         by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
         Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
         mailing to Public Partnership Unitholders and at the time of the Public
         Partnership Unitholders Meeting, contain any statement, which, at such
         times and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is
         false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits
         to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
         therein not false or misleading. Each of the Parties further agrees
         that if it shall become aware prior to the Closing of any information
         furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy
         Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
         or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
         therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other Parties
         and to take the necessary steps to amend or supplement the Proxy
         Statement. All documents that Public Partnership is responsible for
         filing with the SEC in connection with the Public Partnership Merger
         will comply as to form and substance in all material aspects with the
         applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

         proposed to appear in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
         supplement thereto submitted to the SEC in connection with the

         provision of any partnership, limited liability company or
         indemnification agreement pursuant to which any Seller, its Affiliates
         or any of their directors, officers, members, partners or other
         controlling persons is or may be entitled to exculpation or
         indemnification; and Buyer shall cause Public Partnership Surviving
         Partnership and Private Partnership Surviving Partnership to honor any
         such provision and to pay any amounts to which such Seller or any of
         such other Persons would properly be entitled thereunder; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that Seller Parent, General Partner and any other Subsidiary
         of Seller Parent (other than Public Partnership, Private Partnership
         and their Subsidiaries) and the directors and officers of Seller Parent
         and persons serving as directors or officers at the request of Seller
         Parent as of the date hereof shall not be entitled to be exculpated or
         indemnified pursuant to any such provision for claims, damages or costs
         to the extent resulting from any fact or circumstance that, between the

         representations or warranties contained in this Agreement.

                  (b) Buyer acknowledges that Public Partnership Surviving
         Partnership and Private Partnership Surviving Partnership intend to
         maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with a

         officers of Private Partnership and Public Partnership and for
         directors and officers of General Partner for claims arising from
         wrongful acts prior to the Closing and Buyer agrees that, for a period
         of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer shall not take any
         affirmative action which causes the termination or cancellation of such
         insurance coverage unless Buyer shall replace such insurance coverage
         with comparable insurance coverage; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Public
         Partnership Surviving Partnership and Private Partnership Surviving
         Partnership, considered in the aggregate, shall in no event be required
         to expend pursuant to this Section 4.17(b) more than an amount per year
         equal to 150% of the current premiums paid by Public Partnership and
         Private Partnership (such premiums having been Previously Disclosed),
         considered in the aggregate, for such insurance.

         4.18 FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER PARENT. CDC Finance agrees to cause
Buyer Parent and Buyer to fullfill all of its financial obligations under this

contemplated by the Transaction Documents or for a Party to obtain the benefits
contemplated by any of the Transaction Documents. Following the Closing Date,
the Parties shall cooperate with one another to prepare and file all documents
and forms and amendments thereto as may be required by Applicable Law with
respect to the Transactions.

General Partner to the Private Partnership Unitholders for the purposes of
obtaining such written consent (or, if a meeting of the Private Partnership

at such meeting of any adjournment or postponement thereof); PROVIDED that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (a) above shall not be
available to any Party that has breached in any material respect its obligations
under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately and substantially
contributed to the occurrence of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated.

         6.03 TERMINATION BY BUYER. This Agreement may be terminated by written
notice provided by Buyer and the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing, whether before or after the approval by the Public Partnership

(including by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Public Partnership Unitholders) within the time
period required pursuant to Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange Act, or (ii) there has
been a breach by any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement that (x) would entitle Buyer to assert
that the conditions to its obligations hereunder set forth in Section 5.02(a) or

         taking such action is required to comply with its fiduciary duties
         under Applicable Law, (ii) the board of directors of General Partner

         business days of receipt of the General Partner's written
         notification of its intention, an offer that the board of directors
         of General Partner determines, in good faith after consultation with
         its advisors, is at least as favorable, from a financial point of
         view, to the members, partners or unitholders, as the case may be,
         as the Superior Proposal and (iv) simultaneously with such
         termination such Seller pays or causes Private Partnership to pay to
         Buyer in immediately available funds the Termination Fee described
         in Section 6.06; or

                  (b) if at any time prior to the Closing there has been a
         breach by Buyer of any covenant, representation, warranty or agreement
         contained in this Agreement that (x) would entitle General Partner to
         assert that the conditions to its obligations hereunder set forth in
         Section 5.03(a) or (b) have not been satisfied and (y) is not curable
         or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days after written
         notice of such breach is given by the General Partner.

         6.05 EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions pursuant to this

shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any Party
(or of any of its directors, officers, controlling persons, employees, agents,
legal and financial advisors or other representatives); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any Party
of any liability or damages resulting from any wilful breach of this Agreement.

         in Section 6.04(a). Such payment shall be made to Buyer in immediately
         available funds within three business days after the occurrence of the
         Fee Triggering Event.


                                       61
<PAGE>

                  (b) The term "FEE TRIGGERING EVENT" shall mean any of the
         following events or transactions occurring on or after the date hereof:

                           (i) this Agreement is terminated by the General
                  Partner pursuant to Section 6.04(a); or

                           (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
                  pursuant to Section 6.02(c) or 6.03(i) and, within 12
                  months after such termination, a Seller either (A) enters
                  into a binding agreement with any Person providing for a
                  transaction implementing an Acquisition Proposal or (B)
                  consummates an Acquisition Proposal.

                  (c) General Partner shall notify Buyer promptly in writing of
         the occurrence of any Fee Triggering Event.

                  (d) The payment by the Public Partnership or Private
         Partnership of the Termination Fee required to be made by this Section
         6.06 shall constitute liquidated damages for any breach by any of the
         Sellers (other than a willful breach by any of the Sellers) of this
         Agreement although a breach is not necessary for any payment to be
         required to be made under this Section 6.06.

                  (e) Each of the Sellers acknowledges that the agreements
         contained in this Section 6.06 are an integral part of the Transactions
         and that, without these agreements, neither Buyer nor any of its
         Subsidiaries would have entered into this Agreement or any of the other
         Transaction Documents; accordingly, if Private Partnership fails to
         promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 6.06, and, in
         order to obtain such payment, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
         commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Sellers for
         the Termination Fee, the Private Partnership shall pay to Buyer its
         reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
         connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
         Termination Fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the
         date such payment was required to be made.

clause (iii) shall (A) in the case of any such amendment or modification
proposed after the Public Partnership Unitholders shall have approved this
Agreement and the Public Partnership Merger at the Public Partnership
Unitholders Meeting, alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to
be received by Public Partnership Unitholders and holders of Private
Partnership Units pursuant to this Agreement without such Party's consent,
(B) reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of
any of the Transactions or (C) constitute a waiver of any provision of this
Agreement other than in accordance with clause (i) of this Section 7.02.

         7.03 GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all
         respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
         accordance with the law of the State of New York applicable to
         contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state (except
         to the extent mandatory provisions of U.S. federal law or the DE
         Partnership Law are applicable).

                  (b) Each Party (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
         jurisdiction of any federal court or New York State court located in
         the State and City of New York in the event any dispute arises out of
         or relates to the Transaction Documents or any of the Transactions,
         (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
         jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court,
         including, without limitation, a motion to dismiss on the grounds of
         forum non conveniens and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action
         arising out of or relating to the Transaction Documents or any of the
         Transactions in any court other than a federal court or New York State
         court sitting in the State and City of New York.

                  (c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy
         which may arise under the Transaction Documents or the Transaction is
         likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each
         such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such
         Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly
         or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Transaction Documents
         or the Transactions. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no
         representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented,
         expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not,


                                       63

         in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver,
         (ii) each Party understands and has considered the implications of
         this waiver, (iii) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and
         (iv) each Party has been induced to enter into the Transaction
         Documents to which it is a Party by, among other things, the mutual
         waivers and certifications in this Section 7.03.

         7.04 WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. To the extent that Buyer Parent,
Buyer, Public Partnership Surviving Partnership or Private Partnership
Surviving Partnership has any sovereign immunity under the laws of France or
any other country or in accordance with any international treaty to which the
French Republic is a signatory or from which France is a non-signatory
beneficiary, each of Buyer Parent, Buyer, Public Partnership Surviving
Partnership or Private Partnership Surviving Partnership hereby waives the
defense of sovereign immunity for all purposes, including, without
limitation, defenses with respect to the commencement of litigation, court
proceedings relating thereto, any pre- or post-award attachment, any pre- or
post judgment attachment, or execution of any award or judgment.

         7.05 NOTICES. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any Party to the others shall be in writing and delivered
