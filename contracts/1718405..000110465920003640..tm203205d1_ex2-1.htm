the legal interest or legal title to or in any of the Transferred Assets, or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, cannot
be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed hereunder as of the Effective Time
because (i) any waiting or notice period has not expired, (ii) any consents or
approvals required for such transfer have not been obtained or waived or
(iii) such transfer would constitute a violation of applicable Law, then
the legal interest in such Transferred Assets shall not be sold, assigned,
transferred or conveyed at the Effective Time. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents or approvals as may be necessary to
complete such transfers as soon as practicable after the Closing.

  



  

(c) For so long as any such consent or approval shall not be

designed to provide for Acquisition Sub all benefits intended to be assigned
to Acquisition Sub under the relevant Seller Contract, Permit or Transferred
Asset, including (A) enforcement of any and all rights of Seller against the
other party thereto arising out of a breach thereof by such other party or
otherwise and (B) paying to Acquisition Sub any monies received under such
Seller Contract, Permit or Transferred Asset; and (ii) Acquisition Sub shall,
at its own cost and for its own benefit, perform, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, the obligations of Seller with respect to any such Seller
Contract, Permit or Transferred Asset to the extent it is obtaining all
benefits of such Seller Contract, Permit or Transferred Asset.

  



  

(d) Acquisition Sub shall bear all costs and expenses associated
with the assignment to Acquisition Sub and its Affiliates of all the
Transferred Assets that could not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed
at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_ , including any such Transferred
Assets constituting Seller Registered Intellectual Property, and Acquisition
Sub shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the recordation by
Acquisition Sub of such Seller Registered Intellectual Property. For the
avoidance of doubt, Acquisition Sub shall not be required to expend monies in
order to obtain any consent or approval required in connection with the
assignment, transfer or conveyance of the Transferred Assets pursuant to this
_Section 1.8_.

  



  

(e) As of the Effective Time, (i) Acquisition Sub agrees and
undertakes to assume the Acquisition Sub Assumed Liabilities and to duly and
properly perform and discharge the outstanding obligations under the
Acquisition Sub Assumed Liabilities and (ii) Parent agrees and undertakes to

Article II

  



  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SELLER_

  



  

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as
follows:

  



  

2.1 _Seller Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) All of the Seller's direct and indirect Subsidiaries, together
with their state of incorporation or formation, as applicable, and each
jurisdiction in which they are qualified or licensed to do business, are
listed in Part 1 of _Section 2.1(a)_ of the letter dated as of the date of
this Agreement delivered by the Seller to Parent and Acquisition Sub prior to
or in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "
_Seller Disclosure Letter_ ") (as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing, the " _Seller Subsidiaries_ "). Except as set forth in Part 2 of
_Section 2.1(a) _ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Seller or one or more
of the Seller Subsidiaries owns, and following the LLC Conversions will own,
all of the outstanding equity securities of the Seller Subsidiaries, free and
clear of all Liens (other than any transfer restrictions arising under
applicable securities Laws). Except as set forth in Part 3 of _Section 2.1(a)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Direct Subsidiary Equity Interests and
the Transferred Assets constitute, and following the LLC Conversions will
constitute, all of the Seller's assets. All of the Seller's assets that will
be transferred to Acquisition Sub in connection with the Closing, other than
the Direct Subsidiary Equity Interests, are described in Part 4 of _Section
2.1(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Transferred Assets_ ").
Except for the Seller Subsidiaries, the Seller does not own, directly or
indirectly, any ownership, equity, profits or voting interest in any Person or
have any agreement or commitment to purchase any such interest, and has not
agreed and is not obligated to make nor is bound by any written, oral or other
agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument,
note, option, warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance
policy, benefit plan, commitment or undertaking of any nature, as of the date
hereof or as may hereafter be in effect under which it may become obligated
to make any future investment in or capital contribution to any other Person.

  



  

(b) Each Seller Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to do so would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Seller
Subsidiary that is a limited liability company is and, following the LLC
Conversions, each Seller Subsidiary that is a corporation as of the date of
this Agreement but will be a limited liability company following the LLC
Conversions will be, duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its state of organization or formation and has (and
will have, in the case of a Seller Subsidiary that is a corporation as of the
date of this Agreement but will be a limited liability company following the
LLC Conversions) the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Complete and correct copies of the
Charter Documents of each Seller Subsidiary, as amended and currently in
effect, have been heretofore delivered or made available to Parent. No Seller
Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(c) Each Seller Subsidiary is (and, following the LLC Conversions,
to the extent applicable, will be) qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) Allied Nevada (Cayman) Corp., an exempted company formed under
the Laws of the Cayman Islands, (i) underwent a strike-off
dissolution pursuant to Section 156 of the Companies Law (2016 Revision) of
the Cayman Islands, effective as of March 30, 2018, (ii) thereafter ceased to
exist and (iii) is therefore no longer a Subsidiary of the Seller.

  



  

2.2   _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) _Section 2.2(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth,
as of the date of this Agreement, for each Seller Subsidiary, the number of
shares or other equity interests (i) authorized with respect to such Seller
Subsidiary, (ii) issued and outstanding with respect to such Seller
Subsidiary and (iii) the holder of such shares or equity interests, as
applicable (collectively, the " _Subsidiary Equity Interests_ "). Other than
the Subsidiary Equity Interests, no Seller Subsidiary has any class or series
of securities or ownership interests authorized by its Charter Documents.
_Section 2.2(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of
this Agreement, each holder of Subsidiary Equity Interests and all Subsidiary
Equity Interests owned by such Person. All outstanding Subsidiary Equity
Interests have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and are non-
assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights. Each Subsidiary Equity
Interest has been issued in compliance in all material respects with (x)
applicable Law and (y) the applicable Seller Subsidiary's Charter Documents.
Following the consummation of the LLC Conversions, the information set forth
in _Section 2.2(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter will continue to
be accurate with respect to the limited liability company interests of the
Seller Subsidiaries into which the Subsidiary Equity Interests convert in
connection with the consummation of the LLC Conversions. Upon the consummation
of the LLC Conversions, all outstanding limited liability company interests
into which the Subsidiary Equity Interests convert will have been duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and will be non-assessable and will
not be subject to preemptive rights. Each such limited liability
company interest will have been issued in compliance in all material respects
with (A) applicable Law and (B) the applicable Seller Subsidiary's Charter
Documents.

it is bound obligating the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to issue, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, or repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, or cause the repurchase, redemption or acquisition of, any
ownership interests of any Seller Subsidiary or obligating the Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into

Charter Documents of the Seller Subsidiaries and the Stockholders

rights, and there is no voting trust, proxy, rights plan, anti-takeover plan
or other agreements or understandings to which the Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is
bound with respect to any ownership interests of the Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary.

  



  

(e) Except as provided for in this Agreement, as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions, no shares of capital stock, warrants,
options or other securities of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary are
issuable and no rights in connection with any shares, warrants, options or
other securities of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary accelerate or
otherwise become triggered (whether as to vesting, exercisability,
convertibility or otherwise). The Seller Warrants will remain outstanding
obligations of the Seller after the Closing.

  



  

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(f)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, no outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock or Subsidiary
Equity Interests are unvested or subjected to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other similar condition under any applicable agreement with the
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary.

  



  

2.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Financial Advisor
Opinion_.

  



  

(a) The Seller has the requisite power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and each of the other Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party and perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
to consummate the Transactions (including the Acquisition), subject to
receipt of the Requisite Seller Stockholder Approval. The execution and
delivery by the Seller of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
to which it is a party and the consummation by the Seller of the Transactions
(including (i) the Acquisition and (ii) the distribution of the Purchase
Shares pro rata to the Seller Stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the consummation of the Transactions) have been duly
and validly authorized by the Seller, and, subject to receipt of the
Requisite Seller Stockholder Approval, no other proceedings on the part of the
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this

other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party shall be when delivered,
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other Parties hereto and

which it is a party shall constitute when delivered, the legal and binding
obligations of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with
their terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally or by principles governing the availability of
equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b) The Seller Board has received an oral opinion of Greenhill and
Co., Canada, Ltd., which will be subsequently confirmed in writing, that as
of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various
qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set forth therein,
the Aggregate Acquisition Consideration to be received by the Seller, together
with the assumption by Parent of the Assumed New Subordinated Notes, in each
case, pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Seller.

  



  

2.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Seller

result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on the
ownership interests in the Seller Subsidiaries or any of the properties or
assets of any of the Seller Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Seller Contracts,
except, with respect to clause (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and subject to receipt of the Requisite Seller Stockholder Approval,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, or the other

of its obligations hereunder and thereunder will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for (i) filings required with Nasdaq with respect
to the Transactions, (ii) applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities

thereunder, and appropriate documents received from or filed with the relevant
authorities of other jurisdictions in which the Seller is licensed or
qualified to do business, (iii) the filing of any notifications
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

each of their respective properties and assets are, and since October 22,

Laws, including with respect to the conduct of its business and the ownership
or operation of its business (and assuming the Seller's emergence from "care
and maintenance mode" and recommencement of production and mining operations
at the Mine), except for failures to comply or violations which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. The properties, assets, businesses and activities of
the Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have not been and are not being
maintained, utilized or conducted in violation of applicable Laws, except as

and, together with the Seller Audited Financial Statements, the " _Seller
Financial Statements_ "). The Seller Interim Financial Statements comply as
to form in all material respects, and were prepared in accordance, with U.S.
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, subject

consolidated financial position of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries at
the date thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the period indicated.

Amounts, at the Closing, neither the Seller nor any of the Seller
Subsidiaries will have any outstanding Indebtedness other than pursuant to the
Sprott Credit Agreement.

except for liabilities (i) incurred or accrued since the date of the most
recent Seller Financial Statements (A) in the Ordinary Course of Business

the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) that arise under any Seller
Contract, none of which arose out of a breach of Contract or violation of
Law, (iii) that are disclosed in the Seller Financial Statements, or (iv)

options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such Seller Common Stock),
(iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any of the shares of
Seller Common Stock, (iv) any material change by the Seller or any of the
Seller Subsidiaries in its accounting methods, principles or practices,

thereof) or applicable Law, (v) any change in the auditors of the Seller, (vi)
any issuance of shares of Seller Common Stock or the ownership interests of
any Seller Subsidiary, or (vii) any revaluation by the Seller of any of its
assets, including any sale of assets of the Seller other than in the Ordinary

13

 



    



  

2.9 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened in writing against the Seller or any
of the Seller Subsidiaries before any Governmental Entity, except, if
adversely determined, as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

2.10   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Section 2.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list of each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning

based, termination, severance, retention, change in control, employee loan,
retiree medical or life insurance, educational, employee assistance, fringe
benefit and each other employee benefit plan, policy, agreement, program or
arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal,
oral or written, which the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries sponsors,
maintains, contributes to or is required to contribute to for the benefit of
its current or former employees, contractors, directors, officers, or
with respect to which the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries has or
could reasonably be expected to have any direct or indirect present or future
liability (including on account of an ERISA Affiliate) (collectively, the "
_Employee Benefit Plans_ ").

  



  

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Seller has
made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the
following documents, to the extent applicable: (i) all plan documents,
including any related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding
arrangements, and all amendments thereto, (ii) for the most recent plan year,

14

 



    

  



  

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
all applicable Law. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that
would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Seller or
any of the Seller Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d)  Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code does so qualify and has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or is in the form of a prototype or volume
submitter document that is the subject of a favorable opinion or advisory
letter from the IRS, and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income
taxation under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code are so exempt.
Nothing has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists that
could reasonably be expected to cause the denial or loss of such
qualification or exemption.

  



  

(e)  No Employee Benefit Plan is, and none of the Seller, the Seller
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has at any time
sponsored or has ever been obligated to contribute to, or had any liability in
respect of, (i) an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA (including any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section (3)(37) of ERISA), (ii) a "multiple employer plan" as defined in
Section 413(c) of the Code, or (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement"
within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

  



  

(f)  No Employee Benefit Plan provides for, and none of the Seller,
the Seller Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any
liability in respect of, post-retiree or post-employment health, welfare or
life insurance benefits or coverage for any individual, except as may be
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, or similar state Law and at the sole expense of such individual.

  



  

(g)  With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, (i) no Legal
Proceedings (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
or audits are pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, the assets of any of the trusts under
such plans or the plan sponsor or administrator, or any fiduciary of any
Employee Benefit Plan with respect to the operation thereof, and (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Seller, no facts or circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Legal Proceedings or audits,
in either case that would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. With respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan, since the Emergence Date, no event has occurred, and
to the Knowledge of the Seller, no condition exists that would subject the
Seller to any material tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by
ERISA, the Code or other Laws (including by reason of the
Seller's affiliation with any ERISA Affiliates).

  



  

(h)  All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be
made or accrued as of the date hereof to the Employee Benefit Plans have been
timely made or accrued. The Seller does not have any plan or commitment to
establish any new Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any Employee Benefit
Plan (except to the extent required by applicable Law or to conform any such
Employee Benefit Plan to the requirements of applicable Law).

Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in connection with
any other event, directly or indirectly, (i) result in any payment or benefit
becoming due to any current or former employee, contractor, director or
officer of the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or under any Employee
Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of

employee, contractor, director or officer of the Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries or under any Employee Benefit Plan or (iv) limit the right to
merge, amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(j)  Except as set forth in _Section 2.10(j)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor

any other event, directly or indirectly, give rise to any payments or
benefits that, separately or in the aggregate, could result in any excise tax
owing under Section 4999 of the Code or that could be non-deductible under
Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(k)  Neither the Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has any
obligation to gross-up or reimburse any individual for any tax or related
interest or penalties incurred by such individual, including under Sections

(a)  Neither the Seller nor the Seller Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract. There are no
representation proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened to be
brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or other labor
relations tribunal, nor has any such representation proceeding, petition, or
demand been brought, filed, made, or threatened within the last three

Seller Subsidiaries had ceased mining operations, and their
operations consisted primarily of care and maintenance of the Mine, including

2019, the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries commenced the restart and "ramp
up" of mining operations at the Mine. Except as set forth in _Section
2.11(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, neither the Seller nor any of the
Seller Subsidiaries has experienced any strikes, slowdowns, lockouts,
arbitrations, material grievances or other labor disputes, unfair labor
practice charges, grievances or complaints by or on behalf of any employee,
former employee, or labor organization, nor, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
is any such action or activity presently threatened in writing against the
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary.

(c)  Each employee and consultant of the Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries is terminable "at will" subject to applicable notice periods as
set forth by Law or in any applicable employment agreement other than
severance obligations thereunder, and there are no agreements or
understandings between the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries and any of their
employees or consultants that their employment or services will be for any
particular period. To the Knowledge of the Seller, as of the date hereof, none

intent to terminate his or her employment with the Seller. The Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms
of any employment and consulting agreements between the Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries and such individual.

discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers' compensation and
the collection and payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and any
similar tax except for non-compliance that has not had, or would not,

likely to give rise to any valid material claim by any individual for
compensation on termination of employment (beyond any severance pay to
which such individual may be entitled under any applicable employment
agreement). All amounts that the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries are
legally required to withhold from their employees' wages and to remit to any
Governmental Entity as required by applicable Law have been withheld and
remitted, and the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries do not have any
outstanding obligation to make any such withholding or remittance, other than
with respect to an open payroll period. There are no pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened in writing Legal Proceedings against the

any Seller Subsidiary's rights to, or the use or operation of, the Mine and
any tangible property on, in or under the Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property or otherwise used in connection with mining and processing minerals
or related activities.

the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any of the

any Person pursuant to any Parent Contract, including any "change of control"
or similar provision.

Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against or otherwise relating to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity.

Parent and Acquisition Sub have not conducted any business activities other
than activities (a) in connection with its organization or (b) directed toward

Charter Documents, there is no agreement, contract, commitment or Order
binding upon Parent or its Subsidiaries or to which Parent or its Subsidiaries

prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of it or its
Subsidiaries, any acquisition of property by it or its Subsidiaries or the
conduct of business by it or its Subsidiaries (including, in each case,
following the Closing). Acquisition Sub does not have any operations, has not
generated any revenues and has no liabilities other than those incurred in
connection with the foregoing and in association with the Transactions.

  



  

3.11   _Parent Contracts_.

  



  

(a)  There are no material Contracts to which Parent or any of

(b)  Each Parent Contract was entered into at arms' length and
in the ordinary course, is in full force and effect and is valid and binding
upon and enforceable against each of the parties thereto, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. True, correct and complete copies of all Parent
Contracts (or written summaries in the case of oral Parent Contracts) have
heretofore been provided to the Seller or Seller's counsel other than those
that are exhibits to the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

38

 



    



  

(c)  Neither Parent or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto is in breach of or in default

would become a breach of or default under, any Parent Contract, and no party
to any Parent Contract has given any written notice of any claim of any such
breach, default or event, which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably likely be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
agreement, contract or commitment to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which it is bound that has not expired by its terms is in
full force and effect, except where such failure to be in full force and
effect would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

3.12   _Interested Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in the
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement: (a) no
employee, officer, director or Parent Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries
or a member of his or her immediate family is indebted for borrowed money to
Parent nor is Parent indebted for borrowed money (or committed to make loans
or extend or guarantee credit) to any of them, other than reimbursement for
reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of Parent, and (b) to the Knowledge of
Parent, no officer, director or stockholder or any member of their immediate
families is, directly or indirectly, interested in any contract with Parent
(other than such contracts as relate to any such individual ownership of
capital stock or other securities of Parent).

notified by Nasdaq that it does not comply with any Nasdaq listing rule,
which noncompliance is not subject to any compliance extension or ability to
remedy, in each case as permitted by the Nasdaq continued listing rules.
There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent by Nasdaq or the SEC with respect to any intention
by such entity to prohibit or terminate the listing of Parent Class A Common
Stock or Public Warrants on Nasdaq, other than Legal Proceedings where a
compliance extension or ability to remedy is available under applicable Law.
None of Parent or any of its Affiliates has taken any action to intentionally
terminate the registration of Parent Class A Common Stock or Public Warrants
under the Exchange Act.

  



  

3.14   _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a)  As of December 31, 2019, Parent had $215,385,757 in a trust
account (the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained and invested pursuant to that
certain Investment Management Trust Agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ")
dated as of February 7, 2018, by and between Parent and Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation (" _Continental_ ") for the
benefit of its public stockholders.

  



  

   

39

 



    



  

(b)  The Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Enforceability Exceptions. There are no separate contracts, side letters
or other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied)
(i) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC
Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) to the Knowledge of
Parent, that would entitle any Person (other than Parent Stockholders holding
Parent Class A Common Stock sold in Parent's initial public offering who
shall have elected to redeem their shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
pursuant to Parent's Charter Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account will be released except (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any
interest income earned in the Trust Account and (B) to redeem Parent Class A
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parent's Charter Documents.
There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened with respect to the Trust Account.

  



  

(c)  Parent has made available to the Seller true, correct and
complete copies of the executed and delivered Trust Agreement. The Trust
Agreement has not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification
is contemplated by Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the obligations
and the commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. The Trust Agreement is in full force and effect as of the date
hereof. The Trust Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a material default or breach under the Trust Agreement on the part
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
parties thereto. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement.

entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission from Parent,
the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
connection with the Transactions, the IPO or any other Business Combination
(whether or not consummated) based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent.

  



  

3.16   _Investment Company Act_. Parent is not an "investment
company" or a Person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on
behalf of an "investment company", in each case within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

  



  

3.17   _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) any
report, form, registration or other filing made with any Governmental Entity
(including the SEC) with respect to the Transactions, (b) the Registration
Statement or (c) the mailings or other distributions to the Seller
Stockholders with respect to the consummation of the Transactions will, when
filed, mailed, made available or distributed, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not

(g)  The Seller shall comply with all applicable provisions of

Registration Statement, the solicitation of proxies thereunder, and the
calling and holding of the Seller Special Meeting. The Seller, acting through

52

 



    



  

5.5   _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a)   _Confidentiality_. Any confidentiality agreement
previously executed by and between the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement. Beginning on
the date hereof and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary of this Agreement,
each Party agrees to maintain in confidence any non-public information
received from the other Parties, and to use such non-public information
only for purposes of consummating the Transactions or, in the case of Parent
and Acquisition Sub, the conduct of the business of Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries following the Closing. Such confidentiality obligations will not
apply to (i) information which was known to one Party or their respective
Representatives prior to receipt thereof from the Seller to the extent such
information was received from a source not known by Parent to be subject to a
confidentiality obligation to the Seller, on the one hand, or Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, as applicable; (ii) information which is
or becomes generally known to the public without breach of this Agreement or
an existing obligation of confidentiality; (iii) information acquired by a
Party or their respective agents from a third party who was not bound by an
obligation of confidentiality; (iv) disclosure required by applicable Law or
stock exchange rule; or (v) disclosure consented to in writing by Parent or
Acquisition Sub (in the case of the Seller) or the Seller (in the case of
Parent or Acquisition Sub); _provided_ , that (x) prior to any disclosure
contemplated by clause (iv) above, the Party required to disclose such non-
public information will provide prompt written notice of such requirement to
the other Party so that the other Party may seek, at such other Party's cost,
a protective order or other remedy and (y) in the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained the Party required to disclose such non-
public information will disclose or furnish only that portion of non-public
information which is legally required to be provided as advised in writing by
outside counsel and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public
information. In the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in
_Article_ _ VII_ hereof, each Party will destroy or return or cause to be
destroyed or returned to the other all documents and other material obtained
from the other in connection with the Acquisition contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to return or destroy any
electronic copy of any non-public information that is created pursuant to such
Party's standard electronic backup and archival procedures and outside legal
counsel shall be permitted to retain one copy for record purposes.

  



  

 (b)   _Access to Information_.

  



  

 (i)  The Seller will afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of the Seller during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of business development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel, of the Seller, as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

 (ii)  Parent will afford the Seller and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning the business, including properties, results of operations and personnel, of Parent, as the Seller may reasonably request in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

5.6   _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Acquisition
and the other Transactions, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to accomplish the following: (a) causing the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article _ _VI_ to be satisfied, (b) obtaining all necessary actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities, including with respect to Permits or Environmental Permits, and
making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and taking all commercially reasonable steps to avoid any Legal Proceeding,
(c) obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
required as a result of the Transactions, including the consents referred to
in _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (it being understood, for
the avoidance of doubt, that nothing herein shall require the Seller in
connection therewith to incur any liability or expense or subject itself, any
of the Seller Subsidiaries or the business of the foregoing to any
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
business or to own or exercise control of their assets or properties), (d)
defending any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (e) delivery of any
required notices regarding the Transactions to holders of the Seller's
Indebtedness and (f) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
the Transactions. This obligation shall include, on the part of Parent,
sending a termination letter to Continental substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Trust Termination Letter_ "). In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Parent
Board and the Seller and the Seller Board shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Acquisition, this Agreement or any of the Transactions, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Acquisition and the other
Transactions to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Seller to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
business or to own or exercise control of their respective assets, properties
and capital stock, or the incurrence of any liability or expense.

  



  

5.7   _No Parent Securities Transactions_. Neither the Seller nor any
of its controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall knowingly engage
in any transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of
the making of a public announcement regarding the Transactions. The Seller
shall use its best efforts to require each of its officers, directors and
employees, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to require each of
its other Representatives, associates, clients and customers, to comply with
the foregoing requirement.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

5.8   _No Claim Against Trust Account_. The Seller hereby waives all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind against Parent to collect from
the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to it by Parent for any reason
whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by Parent
or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent (whether in the
past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account at any time for any reason whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of _Section 7.1(b)_
(but only if the Transactions have failed to close by the date specified
therein because of Parent's or Acquisition Sub's breach of an
obligation herein), _Section 7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_ , and Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries completes a Business Combination with another company,
the Seller shall not be prohibited from filing and pursuing a claim for
damages in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions following
consummation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of an alternative Business
Combination, in each case against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
other Person that is party to such alternative Business Combination or
any Affiliate thereof. Furthermore, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not
execute any definitive agreement related to such Business Combination that
(x) attempts to prevent the Seller from so filing or pursuing any such claim,
or (y) permits the Person that survives such Business Combination not to
assume Parent and Acquisition Sub's obligation for damages in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. This paragraph will survive this
Agreement and will not expire and will not be altered in any way without the
express written consent of Parent and the Seller.

  



  

5.9   _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Seller will promptly provide the other Parties with prompt
written notice of any event, development or condition of which they have
Knowledge that (a) is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ not to be satisfied, (b) would require any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement so that such Registration Statement
would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading or (c) constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, any Transaction Litigation. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
will promptly provide the Seller with written notice of any event, development
or condition of which they have Knowledge that is reasonably likely to cause
any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(k)_  not to be satisfied. The
Seller will promptly provide Parent with written notice of any event,
development or condition of which it has Knowledge that is reasonably likely
to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ not to be
satisfied. No notice or failure to provide notice pursuant to this _Section
5.9_ shall in and of itself affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
Parties, or result, in and of itself, in the failure of a condition set forth
in _Article VI_.

  



  

5.10   _Assumption of Assumed Liabilities_. Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Seller shall (a) transfer to Acquisition Sub, and
Acquisition Sub shall assume from the Seller, the liabilities and obligations
of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 5.10_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Acquisition Sub Assumed Liabilities_
" which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Parent Assumed
Liabilities) and (b) transfer to Parent, and Parent shall assume from the
Seller, the liabilities and obligations of the Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries under the Assumed New Subordinated Notes and the Sprott Credit
Agreement (the " _Parent Assumed Liabilities_ "). Parent and the Seller shall
cooperate and take all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate Parent and
Acquisition Sub's respective assumption of such liabilities.

  



  

   

55

therefor, _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party provides a written
affirmation of such Indemnified Party's good faith belief that he or she has

8.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and each
other document executed in connection with the Transactions, and the
consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same document and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by electronic

and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; and (b) other than the rights, at and after the

or restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force
and effect and the application of such term, provision, covenant or
restriction to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree
to replace such void or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or

covenant or restriction that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable term,
provision, covenant or restriction.

  



  

8.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts and
immediate injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
and without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove
damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the Parties. Each of the
Parties hereby further acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy
contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific
performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each
Party hereby further agrees that in the event of any action by any other
Party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a
remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance
or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be
available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds.

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and each other document
executed in connection with the Transactions, and the consummation thereof,
and any Legal Proceeding arising out of this Agreement and each other document
executed in connection with the Transactions, and the consummation thereof,
or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement and
each other document executed in connection with the Transactions, and the
consummation thereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

  



  

8.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the
Parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Chosen Courts in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement and each other document executed in connection with the
Transactions, and the consummation thereof, agrees that process may be served
upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for
such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such manner of service of
process. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third
party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall
not assert as a defense in any legal dispute, that (a) such Person is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason,
(b) such Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the
Chosen Courts, (c) such Person's property is exempt or immune from
execution, (d) such Legal Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
(e) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is improper. Each Party and any Person
asserting rights as a third party beneficiary hereby agrees not to commence or
prosecute any such Legal Proceeding other than before the Chosen Courts, nor
to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause
the transfer or removal of any such Legal Proceeding to any court other than
the Chosen Courts, whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.
Each Party hereby consents to service of process in any such proceeding in any
manner permitted by Delaware law, and further consents to service of process
by nationally recognized overnight courier service guaranteeing overnight
delivery, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at
its address specified pursuant to _Section 8.1_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing in this _Section 8.8_ , a Party may commence any Legal Proceeding in
a court other than the Chosen Courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an
order or judgment issued by the Chosen Courts. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY
CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS, AND THE CONSUMMATION THEREOF, AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING
THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER
DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS, AND THE CONSUMMATION
THEREOF. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD

regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

including by operation of Law, either this Agreement or any of its rights,

classes of capital stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share, which
the Corporation is authorized to issue is [●] shares, consisting of (a) [●]

preferred stock (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

  



  

Section 4.2 _Preferred Stock_. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to
time in one or more series. The Board is hereby expressly authorized to
provide for the issuance of shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more
series and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included
in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other
rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included
in a certificate of designation (a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ ") filed
pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the
authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt
any such resolution or resolutions.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Common Stock._

  



  

(a) _Voting._

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of
Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the
Corporation.

  



  

(ii) The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such
share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which
the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

  



  

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of Common
Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to
vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted
to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock
shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock
Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding
series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are
entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one
or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

  



  

(b) _Dividends._ Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other
distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the
Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and
shall share equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.

  



  

(c) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation._ Subject to
the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred
Stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of
the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of the

create and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof
to purchase shares of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock

empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other
terms and conditions of such rights, warrants or options; provided, however,
that the consideration to be received for any shares of capital stock subject
thereto may not be less than the par value thereof.

Section 4.5 _No Class Vote on Changes in Authorized Number of Shares of
Stock_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series

may be further amended from time to time (" _By-Laws_ "), the Board is hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be

separately by class or series, shall be at least one, or such larger number
as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of at least a majority of the
directors then in office.

  



  

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred
Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to
the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors
shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
thereon.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been
elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase
in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause

office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not
by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been
elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, and except as
required by law, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at
any time by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power
of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _ Article V_, and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable laws of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is or was made
a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or
in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (each, a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees and disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes,
damages, claims and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The
Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay
the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in
defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by
applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition
of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on
behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section 8.2_
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from
time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise. 

  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of
the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision
of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this
_Section 8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only
(except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

(a) To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or
any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the
Corporation or any of its officers or directors in circumstances where the
application of any such doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict
with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the
date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. The
Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of
the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she
may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of
corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or
officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was
offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer
of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally
and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for
the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to
refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any
legal obligation.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, each of Mudrick Capital Management, L.P., Whitebox Advisors LLC,
Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, Aristeia Capital, LLC and Wolverine Asset
Management, LLC and the investment funds affiliated with or managed by
Mudrick Capital Management, L.P., Whitebox Advisors LLC, Highbridge Capital
Management, LLC, Aristeia Capital, LLC and Wolverine Asset Management, LLC
and their respective successors and Affiliates (as defined in Article 10.3)
(other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries) and all of their respective
partners, principals, directors, officers, members, managers, equity
holders and/or employees, including any of the foregoing who serve as
officers or directors of the Corporation (each, an " _Exempted Person_ ")
shall not have any fiduciary duty to refrain from engaging directly or
indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, except as otherwise expressly
provided in any agreement entered into between the Company and such Exempted
Person. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation,
on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to
time available to the Exempted Persons, even if the opportunity is one that
the Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued
or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so,
and each such Exempted Person shall have no duty to communicate or offer such
business opportunity to the Corporation (and there shall be no restriction on
the Exempted Persons using the general knowledge and understanding of the
industry in which the Corporation operates which it has gained as an Exempted
Person in considering and pursuing such opportunities or in making
investment, voting, monitoring, governance or other decisions relating to
other entities or securities) and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or stockholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a
director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Exempted
Person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business
opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity,
or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries, or uses such knowledge and understanding in the manner
described herein, in each case, except as otherwise expressly provided in any
agreement entered into between the Company and such Exempted Person. In
addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporate opportunity shall
not be deemed to belong to the Corporation if it is a business opportunity
that the Corporation is not financially able or contractually permitted or
legally able to undertake, or that is, from its nature, not in the line of the
Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to it or that is one
in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable expectancy. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of
this Article IX.

  



  

(c) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article
IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with
this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in
respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter
occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article
IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition,
repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or
defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any
director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

(iii) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of

Re: Trust Account No. [●] Termination Letter

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Pursuant to Section 1(i) of the Investment Management Trust Agreement between
Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") and Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (the "Trustee"), dated as of February 7, 2018 (the
"Trust Agreement"), this is to advise you that the Company has entered into
an agreement with Hycroft Mining Corporation to acquire substantially all of
the assets and to discharge and pay or assume, directly or indirectly, certain
liabilities of Seller (the  "Business Combination") on or about [●], 2020.
The Company shall notify you at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of
the actual date of the consummation of the Business Combination (the
"Consummation Date"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Trust Agreement.

  



  

In accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, we hereby authorize you
to commence to liquidate all of the assets of the Trust Account on [●] 2020,
and to transfer the proceeds to a segregated account held by you on behalf of
the Beneficiaries to the effect that, on the Consummation Date, all of the
funds held in the Trust Account will be immediately available for transfer to
the account or accounts that the Company shall direct on the Consummation
Date (including as directed to it by the Representative on behalf of the
Underwriters (with respect to the Deferred Discount)). It is acknowledged and
agreed that while the funds are on deposit in the trust checking account at
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. awaiting distribution, the Company will not earn
any interest or dividends.

  



  

   



 



    



  

On the Consummation Date (i) counsel for the Company shall deliver to you
written notification that the Business Combination has been consummated, or
will be consummated concurrently with your transfer of funds to the accounts
as directed by the Company (the "Notification") and (ii) the Company shall
deliver to you (a) a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, which
verifies that the Business Combination has been approved by a vote of the
Company's stockholders, if a vote is held and (b) a joint written instruction
signed by the Company and the Representative with respect to the transfer of
the funds held in the Trust Account, including payment of amounts owed to
public stockholders who have properly exercised their redemption rights and
payment of the Deferred Discount to the Representative from the Trust Account
(the "Instruction Letter"). You are hereby directed and authorized to transfer
the funds held in the Trust Account immediately upon your receipt of the
Notification and the Instruction Letter, in accordance with the terms of the
Instruction Letter. In the event that certain deposits held in the Trust
Account may not be liquidated by the Consummation Date without penalty, you
will notify the Company in writing of the same and the Company shall direct
you as to whether such funds should remain in the Trust Account and be
distributed after the Consummation Date to the Company. Upon the distribution
of all the funds, net of any payments necessary for reasonable unreimbursed
expenses related to liquidating the Trust Account, your obligations under the
Trust Agreement shall be terminated.

  



  

In the event that the Business Combination is not consummated on the
Consummation Date described in the notice thereof and we have not
notified you on or before the original Consummation Date of a new
Consummation Date, then upon receipt by the Trustee of written
instructions from the Company, the funds held in the Trust Account shall be
reinvested as provided in Section 1(c) of the Trust Agreement on the business
day immediately following the Consummation Date as set forth in such notice as
soon thereafter as possible.

2.1.1 _Initial Registration_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable, but
in any event within fifteen (15) business days after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders from time to time as permitted by

conditions specified in this _subsection 2.1.1_ and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective as
soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in no event later than sixty
(60) days following the filing deadline (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ ");
provided, that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90)
days after the filing deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by,
and receives comments from, the Commission. The Registration Statement filed
with the Commission pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall be a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 (a " _Form S-3 Shelf_ ") or, if Form S-3
is not then available to the Company, on Form S-1 (a  " _Form S-1 Shelf_ ")
or such other form of registration statement as is then available to effect a
registration for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such
Registrable Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to
permit any Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at
any time beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement. A
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall provide

available to, and requested by, the Holders. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _subsection 2.1.1_ to remain effective, and to be supplemented and
amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is
available or, if not available, that another Registration Statement is
available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the
Holders until all such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities. As soon as practicable following the effective date of a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ , but in any
event within one (1) business day of such date, the Company shall notify the
Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When effective, a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this  _subsection 2.1.1_ (including
the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact

make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made).

2.1.2 _Form S-3 Shelf_. If the Company files a Form S-3 Shelf and thereafter
the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a Form S-1 Shelf as
promptly as practicable to replace the shelf registration statement that is a
Form S-3 Shelf and have the Form S-1 Shelf declared effective as promptly as
practicable and to cause such Form S-1 Shelf to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another
Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.

  



  

2.1.3 _Shelf Takedown_. At any time and from time to time following the
effectiveness of the shelf registration statement required by _subsection
2.1.1_  or _2.1.2_ , any Holder may request to sell all or a portion of their
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered
pursuant to such shelf registration statement, (a " _Shelf Underwritten
Offering_ ") provided that such Holder(s) (a) reasonably expect aggregate
gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000 from such Shelf Underwritten
Offering or (b) reasonably expects to sell all of the Registrable Securities
held by such Holder in such Shelf Underwritten Offering but in no event less
than $10,000,000. All requests for a Shelf Underwritten Offering shall be made
by giving written notice to the Company (the " _Shelf Takedown Notice_ ").
Each Shelf Takedown Notice shall specify the approximate number of
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Shelf Underwritten Offering
and the expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and commissions)
of such Shelf Underwritten Offering. Except with respect to any Registrable
Securities distributed by the Sponsor to its members following the expiration
of the Founder Lock-Up Period or the Private Placement Lock-Up Period, as
applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt of any Shelf Takedown
Notice, the Company shall give written notice of such requested Shelf
Underwritten Offering to all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the "
_Company Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") and, subject to the provisions of _Section
2.2.4_ , shall include in such Shelf Underwritten Offering all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests
for inclusion therein, within five (5) days after sending the Company Shelf
Takedown Notice. The Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement in a
form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company
with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the Holders after
consultation with the Company and shall take all such other reasonable
actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities. In connection with any Shelf Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _subsection 2.1.3_ , subject to _Section 3.3_ and

of the information reasonably necessary about the Holder to include such
Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
obligated to include such Holder's Registrable Securities to the extent the
Company has not received such information, and received any other reasonably
requested agreements or certificates, on or prior to the fifth business day
prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement
pursuant to this _Article II_.

that such Existing Holders or New Holders, as the case may be, (a) reasonably
expect aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000 from such offering or
(b) reasonably expects to sell all of the Registrable Securities held by such
Existing Holders or New Holders, as the case may be, in such offering but in
no event less than $30,000,000, which written demand shall describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such Registration and the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a " _Demand_
_Registration_ "). The Company shall, within ten (10) days of the Company's
receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing, all other Holders of
Registrable Securities of such demand, and each Holder of Registrable
Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holder's
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
(each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such Registration, a " _Requesting_ _Holder_ ") shall so
notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days after the receipt by the
Holder of the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any
such written notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, such
Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities
included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration and the Company
shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable, but not more than sixty (60)
days immediately after the Company's receipt of the Demand Registration, the
Registration of all Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders
and Requesting Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no
circumstances shall the Company be obligated to effect more than (x) an
aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration by the
Existing Holders under this _subsection 2.2.1_ with respect to any or all
Registrable Securities held by such Existing Holders and (y) an aggregate of
three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration by the New Holders
under this _subsection 2.2.1_ with respect to any or all
Registrable Securities held by such New Holders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Company shall not be required to give effect to a
Demand Registration from a Demanding Holder if the Company has registered
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration from such Demanding
Holder in the preceding 180 days, or (ii) the Company's obligations with
respect to any Demand Registration shall be deemed satisfied so long as the
Registration Statement filed pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ includes all of
such Demanding Holder's Registrable Securities and is effective.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  



  

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a Registration unless and
until (i) the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect
to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared
effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if, after such Registration Statement has been declared
effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant
to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or any other
governmental agency, the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be obligated or required to file
another Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has been
previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

  



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection
2.2.4_ , if a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders so advise the
Company as part of their Demand Registration that the offering of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding Holder or
Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in such
Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such
Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.2.3_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating the Demand Registration, which Underwriter(s) shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar amount
or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the
Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other
Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to
sell and the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has
been requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back
registration rights held by any other stockholders who desire to sell,
exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that
can be sold in the Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the
proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the
probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of such securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum_ _Number_ _of_
_Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten
Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable Securities of the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (in each case pro rata based on
the respective number of Registrable Securities that such Demanding Holder
and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in such Underwritten
Registration and the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that such
Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have requested be included in such
Underwritten Registration (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro_
_Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Registrable
Securities of Holders (Pro Rata, based on the respective number of Registrable
Securities that each Holder has so requested) exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_
hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iii) third,
to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Class A Common Stock or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iv) fourth, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Class A Common Stock or other
equity securities of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated
to register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the

2.2.5 _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. Any of the Demanding Holders
initiating a Demand Registration or any of the Requesting Holders (if any),
pursuant to a Registration under _subsection 2.2.1,_ shall have the right to
withdraw from a Registration pursuant to such Demand Registration or a Shelf
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _subsection 2.1.3_ for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of their intention to withdraw from such Registration
prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to the Registration of their Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Demand Registration (or in the case of an Underwritten
Registration pursuant to Rule 415, at least five (5) business days prior to
the time of pricing of the applicable offering). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Registration pursuant to
a Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten Offering prior to its withdrawal
under this _subsection 2.2.5_.

  



  

2.3 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of
equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, for its own account
or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by
the stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ or _2.1.2_ hereof), other than a Registration
Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option or other
benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to
the Company's existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is
convertible into equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend
reinvestment plan, then the Company shall give written notice of
such proposed filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon
as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing
date of such Registration Statement, which notice shall (A) describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution and the name of the proposed managing
Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all
of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale
of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in
writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (such
Registration a " _Piggyback_ _Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good
faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this _subsection 2.3.1_ to
be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities of the Company included in such Registration and to
permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such
Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.3.1_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

2.3.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a
Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of the Class A Common Stock that the Company
desires to sell, taken together with (i) the Class A Common Stock, if any, as
to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof, and (iii)
the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback registration rights of
other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities,
then:

  



  

(a) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account, the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Class A Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_
hereof, Pro Rata, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to written contractual piggyback registration rights of other
stockholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities;

  



  

(b) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities other
than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall include in
any such Registration (A) first, the Class A Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_, Pro Rata based on
the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested
be included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such
Underwritten Registration, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to
sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the Class A Common
Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities
that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

2.3.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration (or in the case of an Underwritten Registration
pursuant to Rule 415, at least five (5) business days prior to the time of
pricing of the applicable offering). The Company (whether on its own
good faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by
persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal
under this _subsection 2.3.3_.

  



  

2.3.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section 2.2_ hereof or a Shelf Underwritten Offering effected under
_subsection 2.1.3_.

  



  

2.4 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the effective date of, a Company initiated Registration and
provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to
receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders
have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company and the Holders
are unable to obtain the commitment of an Underwriter or Underwriters to
firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board
such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of
such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right
to defer such filing for a period of not more than sixty (60) days; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any 12-month period.

COMPANY PROCEDURES

  



  

3.1 _General Procedures_. If the Company is required to effect the
Registration of Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect such Registration to permit the sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall, as expeditiously
as possible:

  



  

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable a

effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold;

  



  

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to
the Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by any majority-in-interest of
the Holders with Registerable Securities registered on such Registration

by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form
used by the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations
thereunder to keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with
the intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriter(s),
if any, and each Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration, and each such Holder's legal counsel, copies of such
Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement
to such Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such
other documents as the Underwriter(s) and each Holder of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration or the legal counsel for any such
Holders may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holders;

  



  

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or
"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as any Holder of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action
necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any action to
which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation in any
such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed;

  



  

3.1.6 provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and registrar
for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective date of
such Registration Statement;

  



  

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it
shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop
order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose
and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

  



  

3.1.8 at least three (3) days prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document that is to be
incorporated by reference into such Registration Statement or
Prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to each seller of such Registrable
Securities and its counsel, including, without limitation, providing copies
promptly upon receipt of any comment letters received with respect to any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.9 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

3.1.10 permit a representative of the Holders (such representative to be
selected by a majority of the participating Holders), the Underwriter(s), if
any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or
Underwriter(s) to participate, at each such person's own expense, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause the Company's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representative or
Underwriter enters into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of
any such information; and _provided further_ , the Company may not
include the name of any Holder or Underwriter or any information regarding
any Holder or Underwriter in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or Prospectus, any
document that is to be incorporated by reference into such Registration
Statement or Prospectus, or any response to any comment letter, without the
prior written consent of such Holder or Underwriter and providing each such
Holder or Underwriter a reasonable amount of time to review and comment on
such applicable document, which comments the Company shall include unless
contrary to applicable law;

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

3.1.11 obtain a "comfort" letter from the Company's independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration which
the participating Holders may rely on, in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort" letters as the managing
Underwriter(s) may reasonably request, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority-in-interest of the participating Holders;

  



  

3.1.12 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant
to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of
counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration,
addressed to the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the
Underwriter(s), if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the
Underwriter(s) may reasonably request and as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority in interest of the participating Holders;

  



  

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary
form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.14 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12)
months beginning with the first day of the Company's first full calendar
quarter after the effective date of the Registration Statement which
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission);

  



  

3.1.15 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000, use its
reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter(s) in any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

3.1.16 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

3.2 _Registration Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Registration Expenses of all Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It
is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental
selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as
Underwriters' commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing
costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration
Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
representing the Holders.

  



  

3.3 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No person
may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of the
Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder unless
such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided
in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and (ii) completes
and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as
may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

3.4 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a
supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such notice),
or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require
the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company's control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the Company to be
necessary for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not defer its obligations in this manner more than three times in any
12-month period. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the
expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this
_Section 3.4_.

  



  

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of
the Class A Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144,
including providing any legal opinions.

  



  

3.6 _Limitations on Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) Cantor may not exercise its rights under _Sections 2.1_ and
_2.2_ hereunder after five (5) and seven (7) years after the effective date of
the Registration Statement relating to the Company's initial public offering,
respectively, and (ii) Cantor may not exercise its rights under _Section 2.1_
 more than one time.

  



  

3.7 _Transfer Restrictions_.

  



  

3.7.1 During their respective Lock-Up Periods, no Existing Holder or New
Holder shall offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to
purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or distribute any
shares of Class A Common Stock or any securities convertible
into, exercisable for, exchangeable for or that represent the right to
receive shares of Class A Common Stock, whether now owned or
hereinafter acquired, that is owned directly by such Existing Holder or New
Holder (including securities held as a custodian) or with respect to which
such Existing Holder or New Holder has beneficial ownership within the rules
and regulations of the Commission (collectively, the " _Restricted Shares_
"). The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each Existing
Holder or New Holder, as applicable, from engaging in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to
lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Restricted Shares even if
such Restricted Shares would be disposed of by someone other than such
Existing Holder or New Holder. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions
include any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including
any put or call option) with respect to any of the Restricted Shares of the
applicable Existing Holder or New Holder, or with respect to any security that
includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such
Restricted Shares, _provided, however_ , that the foregoing restrictions are
not intended to cover liens established in the ordinary course in favor of a
broker-dealer over property held in an account with such broker-dealer
generally.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

3.7.2 Each Existing Holder and New Holder hereby represents and warrants that
it now has and, except as contemplated by this _subsection 3.7.2_  for the
duration of the Lock-Up Period, will have good and marketable title to its
Restricted Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims that
could impact the ability of such Existing Holder or New Holder to comply with
the foregoing restrictions. For the avoidance of doubt, liens established in
the ordinary course in favor of a broker-dealer over property held in an
account with such broker-dealer generally would not be deemed to impact the
ability of such Existing Holder or New Holder to comply with the foregoing
restrictions. Each Existing Holder and New Holder agrees and consents to the
entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and
registrar against the transfer of any Restricted Shares during the Lock-Up
Period.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and agents and
each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for
use therein. The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing
with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to
the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law,
shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each
person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue
statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the
extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use
therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be
several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities,
and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in
proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities in such offering giving rise to such
liability. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of
such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or
such Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying
party's and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action and the
benefits received by the such indemnifying party or indemnified party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of any Holder under this
_subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds
received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities in such

   | (viii)| no provision of Applicable Laws or any Governmental
Body having competent jurisdiction shall prohibit the closing for the Royalty
or adversely affect in any material respect the Payee's rights or benefits
under this Agreement, and no judgment, injunction, order or decree issued by
any Governmental Body having competent jurisdiction shall prohibit the

---|---|--- 
  



   | (x)| the Payee shall have received a certificate signed by an
authorized senior officer of the Parent confirming the matters set forth in
clauses (3) through (9) above. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Obligation to Satisfy Conditions. The Hycroft Parties shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts and take all commercially reasonable
action as may be necessary or advisable to satisfy and fulfill all the
conditions set forth in this Section 1.4 as soon as practicable. The Payee
shall co-operate with the Hycroft Parties in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as may be reasonably required in connection with the
foregoing. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Waiver of Conditions. Each of the conditions set forth in Section
1.4(ii) is for the exclusive benefit of the Payee, and may be waived by the
Payee in writing, in its sole discretion in whole or in part. 
---|---|--- 
  



   5.| Calculation of Net Smelter Returns 
---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Net Smelter Returns. "Net Smelter Returns" for any given calendar
month means the amount determined by the following formula: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(A x B) - C

  



  

where

  



  

"A" is the Monthly Production;

  



  

"B" is (i) in the case of gold, the Monthly Average Gold Price; or (ii) in
the case of silver, the Monthly Average Silver Price; and

  



  

"C" is Allowable Deductions.

  



   | (b)| Allowable Deductions. For the purposes of calculating Net Smelter
Returns, "Allowable Deductions" shall mean the following Deductions (without
duplication), but only if and to the extent actually incurred and paid by the
Hycroft Entities in respect of the Monthly Production: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| in the case of Precious Metals shipped from the Property in the
form of dore, slag and loaded carbon: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (A)| charges and costs, if any, for transportation and insurance of
dore from the Project's final mill or other final processing plant to places
where such dore is refined (including loading, freight, insurance, security,
surveyor fees, handling fees, port fees, demurrage, and forwarding
expenses incurred by reason of or in the course of transportation); and  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   



 

 |



 

\- 14 -

| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (B)| charges imposed by the refiner for refining dore into Refined
Gold or Refined Silver, as applicable; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

and, for greater certainty, no deductions of the type referred to in (A) or
(B) in this clause (i) shall be applicable in the case of Precious
Metals which are shipped from the Property other than in the form of dore,
slag and loaded carbon; and

  



   | (ii)| in the case of cash payments pursuant to Section 1.3(iii),
actual selling, marketing and brokerage costs of Refined Gold and Refined
Silver, as applicable, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

provided that if Precious Metals are processed on or off the Property in
facilities owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by a Hycroft
Entity, Allowable Deductions will not include any Deductions that are in
excess of those that would have been incurred and have been deductible under
this Agreement had such processing been carried out at facilities not owned or
controlled by a Hycroft Entity then offering comparable services for
comparable products on prevailing terms.

  



   | (c)| Processing Prior to Final Treatment. For greater certainty, if
the Hycroft Entities ship Precious Metals for processing or beneficiation at
a facility prior to final treatment, no deductions for transportation of
the Precious Metals to or the processing of the Precious Metals at the
facility will apply (including any deduction for toll milling). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Provisional Settlement. Where the Hycroft Entities receive any
payment for Monthly Production from a Payor on a provisional basis, the
amount of the Royalty payable shall be based on the gross number of ounces of
Precious Metals credited by such provisional settlement, but shall be
adjusted as between the Owner and the Payee to account for the quantity of
Precious Metals established by final settlement with a Payor. 
---|---|--- 
  



   6.| Taxes 
---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Taxes Payable by Hycroft Parties. Except as required by
Applicable Law or expressly contemplated herein, all payments on account of
the Royalty and any other payment or transfer of property of any kind made
under this Agreement to the Payee shall be made free and clear and without
any present or future deduction, withholding, charge or levy on account
of Taxes, except Excluded Taxes, without setoff or counterclaim. The Owner
shall be liable for all such Taxes directly or indirectly imposed on the
Payee, except Excluded Taxes, and shall indemnify and save the Payee harmless
from any such Taxes imposed on the Payee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Gross-up. All Taxes, if any, except Excluded Taxes, as are
required by Applicable Law to be so deducted, withheld, charged or levied by
the Owner on any such payment, shall be paid by the Owner paying to the Payee
or on its behalf, in addition to such payment, such additional payments as
are necessary to ensure that the net payment received by the Payee (net of
any such Taxes, including any Taxes required to be deducted, withheld, charged
or levied on any such additional amount) equals the full payment that the
Payee would have received had no such deduction, withholding, charge or levy
been required. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   



 

 |



 

\- 15 -

| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (c)| Withholding by Payee. To the extent required by Applicable Law,
the Payee may deduct, withhold, charge or levy, any Taxes imposed by any
Governmental Body on the Payee or any of its Affiliates or otherwise required
to be withheld by the Payee or any of its Affiliates, in respect of any
payment made by the Payee to the Owner or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement. The Payee shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant Governmental Body in accordance with Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Documentation. The Payee shall deliver to the Owner, at the time
or times reasonably requested by the Owner, such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Owner as will permit the
Owner to determine whether payments to be made under this Agreement may be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition,
the Payee, if reasonably requested by the Owner, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the
Owner as will enable the Owner to determine whether or not the Payee is
subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Application to Guarantor. The provisions of Sections 1.1(i) and
1.1(ii) shall also apply to all payments made by the Guarantor to the Payee,
whether made pursuant to its guarantee obligations set out in Section 1.10 or
otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Cooperation. The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate to: (i)
facilitate tax planning with respect to payments on account of the Royalty;
(ii) ensure that no more Taxes, duties or other charges are payable with
respect to the Royalty than is required under Applicable Law; and (iii)
obtain a refund or credit of any Taxes with respect to the Royalty which have
been overpaid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| Overpayment or Credit. If the Payee or any other recipient of any
Royalty or payment or transfer of property of any kind under this Agreement
(referred to in this paragraph as an "indemnified party") determines, in good
faith, that it has received a refund or credit of any Taxes in respect of
which it has received additional amounts pursuant to Section 1.1(ii), it
shall promptly pay to the party that paid such additional amounts (referred to
in this paragraph as an "indemnifying party") an amount equal to such refund
or credit (but only to the extent of additional amounts paid under Section
1.1(ii) with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit and
only to the extent such credit results in a reduction of Taxes otherwise
payable by the Payee or such recipient in the taxation year the additional
amounts are received), net of all out of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of
such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by
the relevant Governmental Body with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying
party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such
indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 1.1(vii) in
the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to
such Governmental Body. The Parties intend that this Section 1.1(vii) shall
prevent the indemnified party from obtaining a windfall as a result of a
payment of, or reimbursement for, the indemnified party's Taxes by the
indemnifying party where such Taxes are not ultimately payable by the
indemnified party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.1(vii), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay
any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 1.1(vii), the
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax
subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section
1.1(vii) shall not be construed to require the Payee to make available its
Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems
confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

forecasts, projections, reports, or other information respecting the Project
as the Payee may from time to time reasonably request. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each notice pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) above shall be accompanied by a
written statement by an authorized senior officer of the Owner setting forth
all material information relating to the occurrence referred to therein,

the Hycroft Parties with the terms of this Agreement. The Owner shall ensure
that the Hycroft Parties each provide the Payee with complete access to all
the Hycroft Parties' Records pertaining to the calculation of the Royalty at
the Hycroft Parties' offices during usual business hours. If any such audits
reveal a material breach of any provision of this Agreement or that payments
on account of the Royalty for any 12 month period have been underpaid by more
than 3%, then: (i) the restriction as to only one audit or other review per
12 month period shall be deemed deleted thereafter for a period of two years;
and (ii) the Owner shall reimburse the Payee for its costs and expenses
incurred in such audit, otherwise all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such audit shall be for the account of the Payee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Inspections. At reasonable times and with the prior consent of
the Owner (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), one time per 12 month
period the Payee and its authorized representatives shall have a right of
access to all surface and subsurface portions of the Property, to any mill,
smelter, concentrator or other processing facility owned or operated by any
Hycroft Entity that is used to process Precious Metals and to any
related operations of the Hycroft Entities for the purpose of enabling the

report) in respect of the Property, upon the request of the Payee, the Owner
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the author(s) of such
report to provide, at the sole cost and expense of the Payee, (i) a copy of
such report to be addressed to the Payee or any of its Affiliates, (ii) the
relevant certificates and consents of the author(s) required in connection
with the filing of and reference to such report to be provided to the Payee or
any of its Affiliates, and (iii) such other consents in connection with the
use of or reliance upon such report by the Payee or any of its Affiliates from
time to time in its public disclosure as may be required by the Payee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Payee or any of its Affiliates is
required by Applicable Law to prepare a technical report under National
Instrument 43-101 or SEC Regulations (or similar report) in respect of the
Property and chooses to prepare its own technical report (or similar report),
the Owner shall cooperate with and allow the Payee and its authorized
representatives to access technical information pertaining to the Property and

it first complies with this Section 1.4(iv) (provided that in the case of
leased properties, the Owner shall only be required to comply with this
Section 1.4(iv) to the extent permitted under the applicable lease or
sublease). If the Owner wishes to abandon any of the unpatented claims
comprising part of the Property or any other interest in the
Property ("Abandonment Property"), the Owner shall first give notice of such
intention to the Payee at least 60 days in advance of the proposed date of
abandonment. If, not less than 15 days before the proposed date of
abandonment, the Owner receives from the Payee written notice that the Payee
wishes to acquire the Abandonment Property, the Owner shall, without
additional consideration, use all reasonable commercial efforts to convey the
Abandonment Property in good standing by quit claim deed, without
warranty, to the Payee or an assignee thereof, and shall thereafter have no
further obligation to maintain title to the Abandonment Property. Payee shall
assume all liabilities and obligations with respect to the Abandonment
Property. The Owner shall not be liable to the Payee if for any reason the
quitclaim cannot be effected pursuant to applicable law or requirements of
Governmental Bodies. If the Payee does not give such notice to the Owner

Property and shall thereafter have no further obligation to maintain title to
the Abandonment Property; provided, however, that if any Hycroft Entity
reacquires a direct or indirect interest in any of the Abandonment Property
within ten years following such abandonment, the production of Precious
Metals from such property shall be subject to the Royalty and this Agreement.
The Owner shall give prompt written notice to the Payee of any such
reacquisition.

exploration, construction, development and mining operations and other
activities in respect of the Property will be performed in a commercially
reasonable manner in compliance with Applicable Laws, Authorizations and
Other Rights, and in accordance with good mining, processing, engineering and
environmental practices prevailing in the industry and on the same basis as if
the Owner retained full economic interest in the Precious Metals. The Owner
shall use all commercially reasonable and lawful efforts to obtain and, once
obtained, maintain all Authorizations necessary to commence and continue
development and mining operations on the Property. The Owner shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Precious Metals from
the Property will be processed in a prompt and timely manner.

   | (c)| Maintenance of Mining Rights. Subject to Section 1.4(iv), the
Owner shall use all commercially reasonable and lawful efforts to maintain
and apply for and obtain any and all available renewals and extensions of the
Property, Authorizations, Other Rights and any and all other necessary rights
in respect of the Project and, other than as expressly permitted by this
Agreement, not abandon any of the Project (including Utility Commitments) or
allow or permit any of the Property, Authorizations, Other Rights or such
other necessary rights referred to above to terminate or lapse. 
---|---|---

perform, pay and observe, or cause to be performed, observed and paid, any
and all liabilities and obligations required by any Applicable Laws,

   | (i)| such Minerals are appropriately identified as to ownership and
origin; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| such Minerals are secured from loss, theft, tampering and
contamination; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| prior to stockpiling, storing or placing such Minerals in
locations other than the Property, the applicable Hycroft Entities shall have
entered into and recorded in the applicable County a written agreement in
recordable form with the property owner where such stockpiling, storage or
placement is to occur providing, among other things, that: (i) the
Payee's rights in and to such Minerals pursuant to the Royalty and this
Agreement, insofar as they are applicable, shall continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding their removal from the Property; (ii) the Payee's
rights in and to such Minerals shall be the same as if the Minerals had never
been removed from the Property; (iii) the Payee's rights in and to such
Minerals shall have precedence over the rights to the Minerals of said
property owner, as well as the creditors of said property owner; (iv)
the agreement shall be irrevocable as long as the Minerals, or any part
thereof, remain on said property; (v) the Payee shall have substantially
similar access rights to said property as provided for in respect of the
Property under this Agreement; and (vi) the Payee's rights in and to the
Minerals pursuant to the Royalty and this Agreement shall otherwise be
preserved; and

-24-

    



   | (iv)| a security interest in such Minerals shall have been granted to
the Payee and recorded, in form and substance satisfactory to the Payee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| Commingling. The Owner shall ensure that the Hycroft Entities do
not process other minerals through their processing plants, or commingle such
other minerals with, Minerals mined, produced, extracted or otherwise
recovered from the Property, unless (i) the applicable Hycroft Entity has
adopted and employs reasonable practices and procedures for
weighing, determining moisture content, sampling and assaying and determining
recovery factors (a "Commingling Plan"), such Commingling Plan to ensure the
division of other minerals and Minerals for the purpose of determining the
quantum of Minerals; (ii) the Payee shall not be disadvantaged as a result of
the processing of other minerals in priority to, or concurrently
with, Minerals, or the parties, acting reasonably, shall have entered into an
agreement to compensate the Payee for any such disadvantage providing for a
commensurate royalty or stream interest in such other minerals or another form
of compensation (a "Compensation Agreement"); (iii) the Payee has approved
the Commingling Plan and, if applicable, the Compensation Agreement, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld; and (iv) the Hycroft Entities keep
all books, records, data, information and samples required by the Commingling
Plan. The Owner agrees to revisit the Commingling Plan and the Compensation
Agreement if the Payee determines that circumstances have changed, in order
to ensure that the Commingling Plan continues to provide for the accurate
measurement of Minerals and the Compensation Agreement reasonably compensates
the Payee for any disadvantage.

leach materials, and other waste materials (collectively, "waste materials")
resulting from the Hycroft Entities' operations and activities at and on the
Property shall be the sole property of the Hycroft Entities, but shall remain
subject to the Royalty should the same be processed or reprocessed, as the

dispose of waste materials from the Property within or at locations other
than the Property and to commingle the same with waste materials from other
properties (provided in any case that any sale of waste materials shall be
subject to the Royalty). In the event waste materials from the Property are

available.

taxes levied, assessed or imposed upon or with respect to the Property or any
part thereof; provided, however, the Hycroft Entities shall not be
required to pay any such tax if the validity and/or amount thereof is being
contested in good faith and by appropriate and lawful proceedings promptly
initiated and diligently conducted of which the Hycroft Entities have given
prior notice to the Payee and for which appropriate reserves have been
established and so long as levy and execution have been and continue to be
stayed. If the Hycroft Entities fail to pay or so contest and reserve for
such taxes, the Payee may (but shall not be required to) pay the same and
invoice the amounts of such payments to the Hycroft Entities for immediate
reimbursement. 
---|---|---

-25-

    



   | (b)| Shipment of Minerals. The Owner shall ensure that each shipment

Parties of each and all of their covenants and obligations under the
Documents. The Payee's security interest and first priority lien on the
Property shall rank in priority to any security interest or lien granted

Credit Agreement) and shall be evidenced by the execution and delivery of the
Deed of Trust by the Owner, and such other security documents as Payee may

held from the Owner or any other Person for the Guaranteed Obligations or
to pursue any other remedy in the power of the Payee whatsoever; 
---|---|---

neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that
of the principal obligation or which reduces a guarantor's obligation in
proportion to the principal obligation; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (xii)| any defense arising by reason of any incapacity, lack of
authority or other defense of the Owner or any other Person, or by reason of

other Person in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, except as a
result of the payment or fulfillment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations, whether by contract, operation of law or otherwise; 
---|---|---

---|---|--- 
  



   | (xvi)| any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the
Owner, the Payee or any other circumstance whatsoever, whether similar or
dissimilar to the foregoing, which might, but for the provisions of this
Section 1.10(ii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge, limitation or
reduction of the obligations of the Owner or the Guarantor hereunder (other
than the payment or performance in full of all of the Guaranteed
Obligations). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the foregoing provisions of this
Section 1.10(ii) apply (and the waivers set out therein will be effective)

to destroy or diminish any subrogation rights of the Guarantor or any rights
of the Owner and the Guarantor to proceed against the Payee for reimbursement
or to recover any contribution from any other Person.

  



  

   

 

-28-

    



   | (c)| Recourse Need Not be Exhausted. The Payee shall not be bound to
exhaust its recourse against the Owner or any other Persons or to realize on

Section 1.10 and the Guarantor hereby renounces all benefits of discussion
and division.

Subject to Section 1.16(vii), the term of this Agreement shall commence on

   | 17.| Transfers 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Each of the Hycroft Parties may only Transfer their rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including the Royalty Deed and Deed of
Trust) or in and to the Property, if as a condition to completion of the
Transfer (and the release of the Guaranteed Obligations in respect of the
transferred obligations), any transferee and its Affiliates shall have first
entered into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Payee,
acting reasonably, to be bound by this Agreement and the Royalty Deed
(including the provision of a comparable guarantee to that provided by the
Parent in this Agreement by any such Affiliates of the transferee). For
greater certainty, the Parent shall cause each of the Hycroft Entities that
are not parties to this Agreement to comply with the terms of this Section

agreement referenced in this Section 1.12(i) upon the written request of any

   | (c)| Effect of Prohibited Transfer. Any Transfer made in violation of
this Section 1.12 shall be null and void and of no force or effect
whatsoever. Any Hycroft Party that Transfers its Obligations in accordance

Obligations hereunder, except for any Obligations that remain outstanding or
for any rights that have accrued to the Payee prior to such Transfer. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.| Transfer Rights of the Payee 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Transfers. The Payee shall have the right to Transfer or
encumber, in whole or in part, its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including the Royalty Deed and Deed of Trust) to any Person,
without the consent of any Hycroft Party, upon the delivery of notice of such
Transfer to the Hycroft Parties. In such a case, provided that such
Person has agreed to be bound by such Transferred obligations under this
Agreement, the Payee, as applicable, shall be released from such Transferred
obligations under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 

-29-

    



   | (b)| Encumbrances. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the

part, its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more
lenders providing financing to the Payee or any of its Affiliates without
notice to, or the consent of, any Hycroft Party. If such transferee enforces
such Encumbrance, it will provide notice to the Hycroft Parties and upon
delivery of such notice, which notice shall confirm that such transferee
agrees to be bound by such transferred obligations under this Agreement, such
Transferee shall become a party to this Agreement with all of the rights and
obligations of the Payee.

the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any Court of the
State of Nevada. Each of the Hycroft Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any forum non conveniens defense to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each Hycroft
Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the State of Nevada.

-31-

    



   | (c)| Memorandum for Recording. The Parties agree that no Party shall

Deed shall instead be recorded. The costs of preparing and recording the
Royalty Deed and Deed of Trust shall be at the Owner's cost and expense. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Confidentiality. The Payee shall not, without the express written
consent of the Owner, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
disclose any data or information concerning the operations of the Hycroft
Entities obtained in connection with this Agreement which is not already in
the public domain (the "Confidential Information"); provided, however, the
Payee may disclose Confidential Information without the consent of the Owner:
(i) if required by Applicable Law or requested by a Government Body having
jurisdiction over the Payee or its Affiliates; (ii) to the Payee's
Affiliates and to any representatives, consultants or advisers of the Payee
or its Affiliates for the purpose of providing services to the Payee or its
Affiliates; and (iii) to any Person to whom the Payee, in good faith,
anticipates Transferring an interest in this Agreement as contemplated by
Section 1.13(i) or 1.13(ii) and such Person's Affiliates and the
representatives, consultants and advisers of such Person or its Affiliates.
In the case of disclosure pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii), the Payee shall be
responsible to ensure that the recipient of the Confidential Information does
not disclose the Confidential Information to the same extent as if it were
bound by the same non-disclosure obligations of the Payee hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Payee shall not be restricted from
disclosing the terms of this Agreement or payments on account of the Royalty.
For greater certainty, the Payee shall be entitled to disclose publicly data
or information concerning the operations of the Hycroft Entities, without
the consent of the Owner, once such information has been publicly disclosed
by any of the Hycroft Entities. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| No Partnership. Nothing herein shall be construed to create,
expressly or by implication, a joint venture, agency relationship, fiduciary
relationship, mining partnership, commercial partnership or other partnership
relationship between the Payee and the Hycroft Entities. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under all
Applicable Laws. If, however, any provision of this Agreement shall be
prohibited by or invalid under any such Applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed modified to conform to the
minimum requirements of such Applicable Law, or, if for any reason it is not
deemed so modified, it shall be ineffective and invalid only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity without affecting the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, or the validity or effectiveness of such provision in any
other jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| Rule Against Perpetuities. If an arbitrator, court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction determines that the term of this Agreement violates
the rule against perpetuities, the rule against unreasonable restraints
on the alienation of property or any other similar rule, then the term of
this Agreement shall automatically be amended to coincide with the maximum
term permitted by the rule against perpetuities, the rule against unreasonable
restraints on the alienation of property or any other similar rule, as
applicable, and this Agreement shall not be terminated solely as a result of
such violation. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the Parties
irrevocably release and waive the applicability of the rule against
perpetuities to the Royalty. Each of the Owner and the Payee agrees and
covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that it will
not commence any action or arbitration proceeding to declare the Royalty
ineffective, invalid or void based on the rule against perpetuities, and that
it will not in any action or arbitration proceeding commenced by the other
Party, or its successors and assigns, as applicable, assert as an affirmative
defense against any claim for relief for enforcement of this Agreement that
this Agreement is ineffective, invalid or void based on the rule against
perpetuities. 
---|---|---

shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given. No failure on the part of Payee to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (l)| Specific Performance. Each of the Hycroft Parties acknowledges
that any breach of this Agreement may cause the Payee irreparable harm for

performance.

ROYALTY DEED AND MEMORANDUM OF ROYALTY AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS ROYALTY DEED AND MEMORANDUM OF ROYALTY AGREEMENT (this " _Royalty Deed
and Memorandum_ "), dated effective as of the [●] day of [●], 2020 (the "
_Effective Date_ ") is by and among Hycroft Resources and Development, Inc., a
Nevada corporation (" _Owner_ "), and Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO)
Inc., an Ontario corporation (" _Payee_ ").

  



  

 _Recital_

  



  

Owner and Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation (collectively, the "
_Hycroft Parties_ ") and Payee are parties to that certain Royalty Agreement
(" _Agreement_ ") dated as of [●], 2020 under which Owner grants to Payee a
Royalty in and to the Property as such terms are defined and further
described in this Royalty Deed and Memorandum. This Royalty Deed and
Memorandum is executed for the purpose of affording notice of the existence
of the Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof, which terms and
provisions are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. This Royalty
Deed and Memorandum summarizes some of the terms and provisions of the
Agreement and is not intended to contain all of the terms and provisions of
the Agreement or to alter or vary any of the terms and provisions of the
Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms in this
Royalty Deed and Memorandum shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Agreement.

  



  

 _Royalty Deed and Memorandum_

  



  

The Agreement contains the following principal terms, among others:

  



  

1. _Royalty_. Owner has created, granted and conveyed to Payee under the Agreement, and does hereby create, grant and convey to Payee, a perpetual royalty in the amount of 1.50% of Net Smelter Returns from Precious Metals produced from those properties described on Exhibit A hereto (" _Property_ "), as more specifically set forth and calculated in the Agreement (" _Royalty_ ").

  



  

   

 



    



  

a. "Precious Metals" means gold and silver in whatever form or state,
which are mined, excavated, extracted, recovered in soluble solution or
otherwise recovered or produced from the Property.

  



  

b. The terms for calculating the Net Smelter Returns and payment of the
Royalty are set forth in the Agreement.

  



  

c. Owner may, but is not obligated to, repurchase up to 33.3% of the
Royalty pursuant to terms set forth in the Agreement. Owner's repurchase
right may be exercised only on the following dates: (i) the first anniversary
of the Effective Date and (ii) the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
In the event Owner exercises its right to repurchase a portion of the Royalty,
an instrument memorializing such repurchase will be recorded in the public
records of Humboldt County and Pershing County, Nevada.

  



  

d. The Royalty is an interest in real property and constitutes the
grant of a vested present interest in the Property and a covenant
running with the land and all successions thereof, whether created privately
or through government action. The Royalty shall be applicable to the Property
and binding upon the Owner and the successors and assigns of the Property. The
Royalty shall attach to any amendments, relocations or conversions of any
mining claim, license, lease, concession, permit, patent or other tenure
comprising the Property, or to any renewals or extensions thereof. If the
United States establishes a leasing system or other system of tenure for
lands or Precious Metals now subject to location under applicable mining
laws, and if the new system gives the Owner an election to acquire rights
under the new system in exchange for or in modification of property rights
comprising part of the Property, the Royalty, the Agreement and this Royalty
Deed and Memorandum shall extend to the lease or other rights granted by the
new system in exchange for such property rights included in the Property.

  



  

e. Payee shall have all of the rights and incidents of ownership of a
non-participating royalty owner, which incidents are covenants running with
the Property and include: (a) the ownership of the non-participating royalty
interests which are interests in real property; (b) the right to receive,
free of expenses other than those deductible in the calculation of net smelter
returns, the Royalty payments; and (c) the obligation of Owner, its
successors or assigns, to make the Royalty payments and taxes assessed to
Payee, which obligation shall run with the land. Payee, however, shall not
have or claim any incidents of the fee simple ownership in the Property,
which incidents include: (a) the right to enter, explore, develop or mine the
claims; (b) the right to execute leases, operating agreements, or similar
instruments with respect to the Property; (c) the right to share in bonus
payments made as the consideration for the execution of leases or other
instruments; and (d) the right to participate in any manner in the decisions
concerning, or the conduct of, operations on the Property.

  



  

2. _Term_. The term of the Agreement commences on the Effective Date and is perpetual.

  



  

   

 



    



  

3. _Abandonment_. The Owner shall not abandon any unpatented claims comprising part of the Property or any other interest in the Property unless it first complies with the Agreement. If the Owner wishes to abandon any of the patented or unpatented claims comprising part of the Property or any other interest in the Property (" _Abandonment Property_ "), the Owner shall first give notice of such intention to the Payee at least 60 days in advance of the proposed date of abandonment. If, not less than 15 days before the proposed date of abandonment, the Owner receives from the Payee written notice that the Payee wishes to acquire the Abandonment Property, the Owner shall, without additional consideration, convey the Abandonment Property in good standing by quit claim deed, without warranty, to the Payee or an assignee thereof, and shall thereafter have no further obligation to maintain title to the Abandonment Property. If the Payee does not give such notice to the Owner within the prescribed period of time, the Owner may abandon the Abandonment Property and shall thereafter have no further obligation to maintain title to the Abandonment Property; provided, however, that if any Hycroft Party reacquires a direct or indirect interest in any of the Abandonment Property within ten years following such abandonment, the production of Precious Metals from such property shall be subject to the Royalty, the Agreement and this Royalty Deed and Memorandum from the effective date of reacquisition. The Owner shall give prompt written notice to the Payee of any such reacquisition.

  



  

4. _Grant of Security Interest; Deed of Trust_. Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, the Hycroft Parties have granted and agree to grant to the Payee, a continuing security interest and a first priority lien on the Property, including all proceeds and products thereof, in order to secure prompt payment of the obligations and prompt performance by the Hycroft Parties of each and all of their covenants and obligations under the Agreement and this Royalty Deed and Memorandum and any amendments thereto. The Payee's security interest and first priority lien on the Property is and shall be evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Deed of Trust by the Owner, and such other security documents as Payee may reasonably require. The Owner shall promptly register or record the duly executed Deed of Trust and such other security documents as Payee may reasonably require with all applicable registries or recording offices, including in the Offices of the Recorder of Humboldt County, Nevada and Pershing County, Nevada.

  



  

5. _Grant of Encumbrances_. Except as provided herein or in the Agreement, Owner shall not cause or allow to be registered or otherwise permit to exist any Encumbrance on the Property ranking senior to or equally with this Royalty Deed and Memorandum other than the Permitted Encumbrances.

The following principles shall be applied in assigning value to the assets of
the Seller for purposes of determining the amount of gain in connection
with the acquisition of the Direct Subsidiary Equity Interests and the
Transferred Assets as described in _Section 1.1_ and for making any required
allocations of the purchase price (including all amounts taken into account in
determining the purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes) under
Code Section 1060 or otherwise. Value shall be assigned among the assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries in the following order and amounts:

  



  

1\. Class I (cash and cash equivalents): the actual dollar amount of assets
in Class I;

  



  

2\. Class II (investments): the fair market value of assets in Class II, as
reasonably agreed to by Seller and Parent;

  



  

3\. Class III (accounts receivable): the fair market value of assets in Class
III, as reasonably agreed to by Seller and Parent;

  



  

4\. Class IV (inventory): the fair market value of assets in Class IV (which
shall be the retail value of such inventory), as reasonably agreed to by
Seller and Parent;

  



  

5\. Class V (property, plant and equipment, prepaid expenses, and other
assets not in any other class): the fair market value of assets in Class V,
as reasonably agreed to by Seller and Parent;

  



  

6\. Class VI (Section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern
value): the fair market value of assets in Class VI, as reasonably agreed to
by Seller and Parent; and

  



  

7\. Class VII (goodwill and going concern value): any residual value after
taking into account the above shall be assigned to the assets of Class VII.
