interests in the shares represented by such Certificates. As of the Effective
Time, Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall enter into an agreement which will

Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and GameStop Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, through the Exchange Agent, cash and certificates representing the shares
of Holdco Common Stock (such cash and such shares of Holdco Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a
record date after the Effective Time and any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and 2.2 in exchange
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and GameStop Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
shares of Company Common Stock or GameStop Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal
(which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such
other provisions as Holdco may specify consistent with this Agreement) and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the letter of transmittal
contemplated in Section 2.3(b)(i), duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.3(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.3(f), and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock or GameStop Common Stock that are not registered in the transfer
records of the Company or GameStop, as applicable, payment may be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered (the " _Transferee_ "), if such Certificate is properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate will be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with Section 2.3(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f). No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Dividends; Other Distributions_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Holdco Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock represented
thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(f), and all such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock
will be paid by Holdco to the Exchange Agent and will be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in
accordance herewith, there will be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Holdco Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Holdco Common Stock issued and all Company Cash Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
and Section 2.3(f)) will be deemed to have been issued or paid, as the
case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates,
subject, however, to Holdcos obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement and in each case which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and there will be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Holdco or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in GameStop Common Stock_. All shares
of Holdco Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of GameStop
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) will be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of GameStop Common
Stock theretofore represented by such GameStop Certificates, subject,
however, to Holdcos obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by GameStop on such shares
of GameStop Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
(ii) prior to the date of this Agreement and in each case which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time, and there will be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of Holdco of the shares of GameStop Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, GameStop Certificates are presented to Holdco or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Fractional Shares_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Holdco
Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Holdco will relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Holdco.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Company Merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holdco
Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
held at the Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such former holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the average of the
closing prices for a share of GameStop Class A Common Stock as reported on
the NYSE Composite Transactions Reports (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the
ten trading days prior to, but not including, the Closing Date (the "
_Average Closing Price_ ") .

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
holders of Company Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3(b).

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time will be delivered to Holdco, upon demand, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II may thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration, and any dividends or distributions, if any, with
respect to Holdco Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Holdco Common Stock, as applicable.

  

### 

  

### (h) _No Liability_. None of Holdco, GameStop, the Company or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Holdco Common
Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock or any cash from the
Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Holdco in direct
obligations of the U.S. Treasury, on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments will be paid to Holdco.  If for any
reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Holdco shall promptly deposit cash into the
Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

  

### 

  

### (j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Holdco the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and,
if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdco
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in each case, due to such Person pursuant to this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

## Section 2.4 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement
and at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Holdco
Common Stock, GameStop Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into
a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision,
combination or exchange of shares or readjustment, or any dividend payable in
stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect
thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event occurs
(any such action, an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the Merger Consideration will
be proportionately and appropriately adjusted to reflect such Adjustment
Event.

  



  

## Section 2.5 _Appraisal Rights_. Shares of Company Common Stock that have
not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which
appraisal has been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Company Merger Consideration at or after the Effective
Time unless and until the holder of such shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
") withdraws such

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

demand for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or
becomes ineligible for such appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
withdraws such demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the
DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such
holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share and will be
converted as of the Effective Time into and represent the right to receive
the Company Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.  The Company
shall give Holdco and GameStop prompt notice of any demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and, prior to the
Effective Time Holdco and GameStop shall have the right to participate in,
and after the Effective Time Holdco shall have the right to direct, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required
by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent
of Holdco and GameStop, which may be given or withheld in its sole
discretion, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable
Law.

  



  

## Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Holdco will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the Company, GameStop or any of the Merger Subs,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company, GameStop or any of the Merger Subs,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the surviving corporation of the Mergers any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the surviving corporations in the
Mergers as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

  



  

## Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code (including any backup withholding or withholding
required by Section 1445 of the Code), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, such amounts withheld shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

## Section 2.8 _Stock Options and Other Equity Awards_. (a)   _Company Stock
Option Plans_. The Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all action necessary so that each option or
other right to acquire one (1) share of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") under the Companys 1998 Equity Participation Plan
and 2000 Equity Participation Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option
Plans_ "), which, in each case, is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, as of the Effective Time,
cease to represent an option or other right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall instead represent the right to receive, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (A) the
Company Cash Consideration _plus_ (B) the Company Stock Consideration
_multiplied by_ the Average Closing

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

Price _minus_ (C) the exercise price per share of such stock option _minus_
(D) any applicable tax withholding.

for that number of shares of Holdco Class A Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of GameStop Class A Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of

Holdco Class A Common Stock, pursuant to applicable plans, programs and
arrangements, upon the exercise or maturation of rights existing thereunder
on the Effective Time or thereafter granted or awarded and (iii) intends to
adopt the Holdco 2005 Incentive Plan (the " _Holdco Stock Option Plan_ ")
which will be substantially in the form of the GameStop Stock Option Plan,
except that the number of shares of Holdco Class A Common Stock issuable
pursuant to such plan will be up to an additional 5,000,000. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Holdco will prepare and file with the SEC a registration

will be maintained) for at least as long as awards granted under the GameStop
Stock Option Plan and Holdco Stock Option Plan remain outstanding.

  



  

(d) _Notices_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco will
deliver to the holders of the GameStop Stock Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the GameStop Stock Option Plan
and the agreements evidencing the grants of such GameStop Stock Options and

bound (collectively, the " _GameStop Benefit Plans_ ") in effect at the date
hereof shall remain in effect after the Effective Time with respect to
employees covered by such Benefit Plans at the Effective Time, until such
time as Holdco shall otherwise determine, subject to applicable Law and the
terms of such Benefit Plans.  Prior to and following the Effective Time, the

and its Subsidiaries, with respect both to employees who were covered by the
Company Benefit Plans and GameStop Benefit Plans at the Effective Time and
employees who were not covered by such Benefit Plans at the Effective Time,

who were covered by the GameStop Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Section
6.16, all references to employees of Holdco means employees of Holdco or any
of its Subsidiaries.

Time, and in which such Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Holdco shall:
(i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Holdco
employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or GameStop Benefit Plan, as
the case may be; (ii) provide each Holdco employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan or GameStop Benefit Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any New Plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all
service of the Holdco employees with the Company or GameStop, and their
respective affiliates, for all purposes (including, purposes of eligibility
to

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

### participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with
respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) in any New Plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New
Plan and only to the extent such service was credited under the analogous
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to outside

the class of directors designated as Class II in accordance with the Amended
and Restated Holdco Charter (or such other class of directors that as of
the Closing Date has the second longest term pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Holdco Charter) and (iii) an additional director who shall qualify
as an independent director (as that term is defined in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of
Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act), designated by the Board of Directors of
the Company and reasonably satisfactory to GameStop and which individual
shall belong to the class of directors designated as Class III in accordance
with the Amended and Restated Holdco Charter (or such other class of
directors that as of the Closing Date has the longest term pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Holdco Charter).

  



  

### (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Holdco Board of Directors
shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the officers of GameStop at

## Section 6.18 _Rights Agreement_. GameStop shall take all necessary
action prior to the Effective Time to cause the dilution provisions of the

"stock acquisition date," "triggering event," "flip-in event," "flip-over
event" or similar event shall occur by virtue of the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the Voting Agreements, and so that the
GameStop Rights Agreement is otherwise inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements, without any payment
to the holders of the GameStop Rights.
