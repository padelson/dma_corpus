 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged and agreed, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Company Units and Blocker Units_. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, for
the consideration set forth in this _Article I_, (a) each Blocker Unit Seller
shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the Blocker Units held
by such Blocker Unit Seller, as set forth on _Exhibit A_, to the Buyer, free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than restrictions on transfer under
applicable state or federal securities Laws or under any organizational
documents of such Person, and the Buyer shall purchase such Blocker Units from
such Blocker Unit Seller and (b) each Company Unit Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver all of the Company Units held by such Company
Unit Seller, as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (other than the Contributed Units),
to the Buyer, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than restrictions on
transfer under applicable state or federal securities Laws or under any
organizational documents of such Person, and the Buyer shall purchase such
Company Units from such Company Unit Seller. In the event a Seller (the "
_Transferor Seller_ ") previously owned Securities (such Securities, the "
_Transferred Securities_ ") that were transferred, or purported to be
transferred, to another Seller (the " _Transferee Seller_ "), and such
transfer may not have been properly executed or documented, such Transferor
Seller hereby agrees to transfer all such Transferred Securities to the Buyer,
on behalf of the Transferee Seller, at the Closing pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms and conditions hereof, and for purposes of this
Agreement, to the extent such Transferred Securities have not properly been
transferred prior to the date hereof, such Transferor Seller shall be deemed a
Seller for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Transferred Securities,
and any provisions relating to such Seller or such Transferred Securities
shall apply as if such Transferor Seller was the Seller for such Transferred
Securities, and any schedule relating thereto shall be deemed automatically
updated in such manner.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at
the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New
York, 10166, on the later of (a) February 3, 2016 and (b) the third (3rd)
Business Day following satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be
satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or at such
other time or on such other date as the parties mutually may agree in writing.
The day on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.3 _Payment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Closing Cash Payment_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers, in the aggregate, an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Net
Purchase Price; _provided_ , that an amount of cash equal to no less than
$8,000,000 and no more than $10,000,000, in Adam Blanks sole discretion,
which amount would otherwise be payable to Adam Blank pursuant this _Section
1.3_ shall instead be paid in shares of common stock of MFRM pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement. The Buyer shall pay to each Seller an amount equal to
such Sellers Estimated Net Purchase Price Per Seller, as calculated and
determined by the Sellers Representative, such payment to be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such Sellers account that has been
specified in writing by the Sellers Representative not later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing. Each Seller hereby agrees that the Buyer
shall have no responsibility for the calculation of the amount payable to the
appropriate Seller under this _Section 1.3_, the Buyers sole responsibility
with respect to payments under this _Section 1.3_ being to make payments in
such amounts and to such accounts as are specified in writing by the Sellers
Representative. For the avoidance of doubt, only Profits Units that are
Eligible Profits Units shall be entitled to any payment hereunder and each
Seller holding any Profits Units agrees that any Profits Units that have not
vested prior to the Closing and do not vest in connection with the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the grant agreement(s) applicable to such Profits
Units shall be forfeited as of the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount
equal to (x) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, _plus_ (y) the Insurance Deductible
Escrow Amount, _plus_ (z) the Sellers Representative Escrow Amount, to the
Escrow Agent, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(c) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Adam Blank shall deliver to the Buyer written notice setting forth the exact
amount of the Estimated Net Purchase Price Per Seller payable to Adam Blank
pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ that Adam Blank desires to receive in shares of
common stock of MFRM in lieu of cash; and

 



 

Section 1.4 _Net Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Sellers Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver
to the Buyer a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth (i) a good-faith estimate of the Companys (A) Net Working Capital (the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ ") and (D) Company
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ "),
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, practices, assumptions,
conventions and policies set forth in _Section 1.4(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Applicable Accounting Principles_ "), and (ii) on
the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the (A) Estimated Net Purchase
Price and (B) Estimated Net Purchase Price Per Seller. An illustrative example
of a Preliminary Closing Statement and calculation of Net Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses is set forth on _Exhibit
B_ (the " _Sample Statement_ ").

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered

 



      
 

 



 

to the Sellers Representative a written statement (the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth a calculation in reasonable
detail of the actual (i) Net Working Capital (" _Closing Net Working Capital_
"), (ii) Indebtedness (" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Cash (" _Closing
Cash_ ") and (iv) Company Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Company Transaction
Expenses_ "), prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting
Principles.

 



 

(c) The Closing Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Statement shall
become final and binding on the forty-fifth (45th) day following delivery of
the Final Closing Statement by the Buyer to the Sellers Representative, unless
prior to the end of such forty-five (45) day period, the Sellers
Representative delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying in reasonable detail the nature, amount
and basis of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Company Transaction Expenses as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement, in which case the Closing Net Working
Capital and the Final Closing Statement shall not be binding upon the parties
with respect to any disputed item and any such disputed item(s) shall be
resolved pursuant to this _Section 1.4_.

 



 

(d) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Sellers Representative to the Buyer, the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative in good faith shall seek to resolve any disagreements
that they may have with respect to the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Company Transaction
Expenses as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between
the Sellers Representative and the Buyer within such thirty (30) day period
shall be final and binding with respect to such items, and if the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each
disputed item specified by the Sellers Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Company Transaction Expenses, the
amounts so determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. If the Sellers Representative and the Buyer have not
resolved all such differences by the end of such thirty (30) day period, the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall submit, in writing, to an
independent public accounting firm not affiliated with any party (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the amounts of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or
Closing Company Transaction Expenses, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make a written determination as to each such disputed item and the
amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Company Transaction Expenses. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall be an independent public accounting firm mutually agreed upon in writing
by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it within thirty (30) days following the submission thereof. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Buyers and the Sellers Representatives respective calculations of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Company Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to
which the Buyer and the Sellers Representative have been unable to agree. The
Independent Accounting Firms services and authority to make a determination
shall be limited in scope to the disputed issues, and the Independent
Accounting

 



      
 

 



 

Firm is not to make any other determination, including any determination as to
whether the Target Net Working Capital or any estimates on the Preliminary
Closing Statement are correct, adequate or sufficient. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Independent Accounting Firms determination of the any disputed item shall be
based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative and solely on this _Section 1.4_ and the definitions and
schedules relating hereto and not on the basis of an independent review. The
Independent Accounting Firm may submit questions to the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative, which each such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
answer within fifteen (15) days after receipt. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. Judgment may be
entered upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm with
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 10.9_. In
acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled
to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



 

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of
the Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the preparation
or review of the Final Closing Statement and preparation or review of any
Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party (or, in
the case of the Sellers Representative, from the Sellers Representative Escrow
Fund).

 



 

(f) The Buyer, the Blockers and the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause
the Blockers, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries (during the period
from and after the date of delivery of the Final Closing Statement through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Net Purchase Price contemplated by this
_Section 1.4_) to, afford the Sellers Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours following reasonable advance
notice and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Blockers, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Blockers, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries and to the work papers, documents and any other
information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated in this _Section 1.4_. Each party shall authorize its
accountants to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in
connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations specified in this
_Section 1.4_; _provided_ , that such accountants shall not be obligated to
make any work papers available except in accordance with such accountants
disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party has signed an
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
acceptable to such accountants.

 



 

(g) Upon resolution of the Final Closing Statement in accordance with this
_Section 1.4_, the Net Purchase Price shall be determined and be as set forth
therein.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) If the Net Purchase Price as finally determined under this _Section 1.4_
is greater than the Estimated Net Purchase Price, then the Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid such difference to the Sellers Representative for the benefit
of the Sellers; and

 



 

(ii) If the Net Purchase Price as finally determined under this _Section 1.4_
is less than the Estimated Net Purchase Price, then the Sellers Representative
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Fund the
amount of such difference, _provided_ , that if the funds then held in the
Adjustment Escrow Fund are less than the difference between the Net Purchase
Price and the Estimated Net Purchase Price, the Sellers Representative shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer all funds then held in the Adjustment
Escrow Fund and each Seller shall, severally and not jointly, pay to the Buyer
its pro rata portion of the deficit (determined in accordance with Section
11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement based on the number and type of Company
Units held immediately prior to the Closing, directly or indirectly, by such
Seller as reasonably determined in good faith by the Sellers Representative
and communicated by the Sellers Representative to the Buyer in writing
concurrently with any payment referred to in this _Section 1.4(g)(ii)_ from
the Adjustment Escrow Fund that does not fully satisfy the obligation to the
Buyer).

 



 

(h) Payments in respect of _Section 1.4(g)_ shall be made within three (3)
Business Days of final determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant
to the provisions of this _Section 1.4_ by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by
the party entitled to such payment. In the event a party that is obligated to
make a payment or cause a payment to be made pursuant to this _Section
1.4(h)_ fails to make or cause to be made such payment in full on or before
the date due, the unpaid amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate from
(and including) the date due, after being finally determined, to (but
excluding) the date on which such unpaid amount is paid; _provided_ , that no
interest shall accrue on any amount that is to be paid under the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(i) (i) Upon the determination of the Net Purchase Price in accordance with
this _Section 1.4_, and (ii) again, upon the release of the Sellers
Representative Escrow Fund as provided in _Section 10.22(d)_, the Sellers
Representative shall recalculate the portion of the Net Purchase Price
(including, if any, all remaining amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Fund,
Insurance Deductible Escrow Fund and the remaining Sellers Representative
Escrow Fund, as applicable) to which each of the Sellers is entitled based on
the number and type of Company Units held immediately prior to the Closing,
directly or indirectly, by each such Seller, in the case of each recalculation
in accordance with Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement as reasonably
determined in good faith by the Sellers Representative. If, as a result of any
such recalculation, the Sellers Representative reasonably determines in good
faith that, pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_ together with any recalculation
contemplated by this _Section 1.4(i)_, any Seller received an amount in
excess of the amount to which such Seller is entitled hereunder, then such
Seller shall deliver the amount of such excess to the Sellers Representative
for the benefit of any other Seller that received an amount less than the
amount to which such other Seller is entitled hereunder, and the Sellers
Representative shall distribute to such other Seller the amounts of such
excess so delivered. Each Seller hereby agrees that the Buyer shall have no
responsibility for the calculation of any amounts payable to such Seller under
this _Section 1.4_. For the avoidance of doubt, only Profits Units that are
Eligible Profits Units shall be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

any payment hereunder and each Seller holding any Profits Units agrees that
any Profits Units that have not vested prior to the Closing and do not vest in
connection with the Closing shall be forfeited as of the Closing.

otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a good faith resolution of
a Tax contest.

circumstances relating to the Company, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) The Buyer is not required to file, seek or obtain any authorization,

"), (ii) for such filings as may be required by any applicable federal or

consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (iv) as may be necessary

or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Brokers_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Buyer.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Buyer s Investigation and Reliance_. The Buyer is a
sophisticated purchaser and has made its own independent investigation, review
and analysis regarding the Blockers, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated hereby, which investigation,
review and analysis were conducted by the Buyer together with expert advisors,
including legal counsel and investment bankers, that it has engaged for such
purpose. None of the Blockers, the Company, the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information, statements or other disclosure concerning the Blockers, the
Company or the Companys Subsidiaries contained herein or made available in
connection with the Buyers investigation of the Blockers, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries and their business, operations, prospects and results,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and the Sellers, the Company
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives expressly disclaim any and
all liability that may be based on any such information, statements or
disclosure or errors therein or omissions therefrom. The Buyer has not relied
and is not relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral or
written, express or implied, made by any Seller, any Blocker, the Company, or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, except as expressly set
forth in _Article III_ (as modified by the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Disclosure Letter), with respect to representations made only by each Seller
as to itself, and _Article IV_ (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter)
with respect to representations made only by the Company as to itself, its
Subsidiaries and the Blockers. None of the Sellers, the Blockers, the Company
or any other Person shall have any liability to the Buyer or any other Person
resulting from the use of any statements, information, documents or materials
made available to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives,
whether orally or in writing, in any confidential information memoranda, "data
rooms," management presentations, due diligence discussions or in any other
form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. None of the Sellers, the Blockers,
the Company or any other Person is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or
forecasts involving the Blockers, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries.
The Buyer acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that there are
inherent uncertainties in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
forecasts and that it takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of any such estimates, projections or forecasts
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any such
estimates, projections and forecasts). Without limiting the representations
and warranties contained herein and subject thereto, the Buyer acknowledges
that, should the Closing occur, the Buyer shall acquire the Securities without
any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose of the Assets, on an "as is" and "where is" basis.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Investment Intent_. The Buyer is acquiring the Securities for its
own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing or
otherwise disposing of the Securities in a manner that would violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "). The Buyer agrees that the Securities may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration under
the Securities Act and such Laws. The Buyer is able to bear the economic risk
of holding the Securities for an indefinite period (including total loss of
its investment) and (either alone or together with its Representatives) has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Solvency_. As of the date hereof, the Buyer will (a) be able to
pay its debts and (b) have adequate capital to carry on its businesses.
Immediately after the Closing, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Buyer and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in all material
respects, the Buyer, the Blockers, the Company and each of the Companys
Subsidiaries, will (a) be able to pay their respective debts and (b) have
adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of

expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would be either
subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or not be deductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in conjunction with another
event (such as a termination of employment), will not (A) entitle any current

relating to periods prior to the Closing and (ii) afford the Representatives
of the Sellers reasonable access (including the right to make, at the
applicable Sellers expense, photocopies of such books and records), during
normal business hours, under the supervision of the Buyers personnel, and in
such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of
the Buyer, to such books and records; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
shall notify the Sellers Representative in writing at least thirty (30) days
in advance of destroying any such books and records prior to the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Closing Date

 



      
 

 



 

in order to provide the Sellers the opportunity to copy such books and records
in accordance with this _Section 5.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) Following execution of this Agreement, the Company and each Blocker shall,
and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate, as may
be permitted by applicable Law, with the Buyer and its independent public
accountant as and when reasonably requested by the Buyer from time to time
during normal business hours and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries. Such reasonable cooperation shall include, without limitation,
providing the necessary information to complete an audit of the Company and
the Blockers and providing appropriate responses, requested information and
representation letters to the auditors and otherwise reasonably facilitating
the ability of the auditors to issue their audit opinion without qualification
in connection with the preparation of such audited balance sheets, income
statements and statements of cash flows with respect to the Company and the

audited financial statements with respect to the Company and the Blockers as
may be determined and requested by the Buyer so long as in each such case,
such cooperation is during normal business hours, to be (i) necessary to
assist the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in complying with certain covenants
contained in agreements or contracts by which the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates is bound; or (ii) required by state or federal Law, rules or
regulations so long as in each such case, such cooperation is during normal
business hours; _provided_ , _however_ , none of the Company, the Blockers or
any of their Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to provide any
opinions or certifications with respect to any matters pursuant this _Section
5.3(d)_ prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Blockers, the Company, the
Companys Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives
from and against any and all Damages incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.3(d)_ and any
information utilized in connection therewith. The Buyer shall promptly, upon
written request, reimburse the Blockers, the Company, the Sellers or the
Sellers Representative for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and other amounts incurred
by their respective Representatives) incurred by the Blockers, the Company,
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of such
Persons contemplated by this _Section 5.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement terminates,
the Company, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance
or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that will or
is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ becoming incapable of being satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and
information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Blockers, the Company or
the Companys Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality agreement

 



      
 

 



 

dated March 23, 2013 between Mattress Firm, Inc. and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of the parties under this _Section 5.5_ shall terminate only in
respect of that portion of the Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the Blockers, the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) After the Closing and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, the
Sellers will treat and hold as confidential all of the Proprietary
Information, and deliver promptly to the Buyer or destroy or cause to be
destroyed, at the request and option of the Buyer, all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of the Proprietary Information (other than this Agreement and
any ancillary agreements described herein) which are in the possession of any
Seller, any Affiliate of a Seller (other than the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries or any Blocker) or any of their respective Representatives. The
obligation to return or destroy Proprietary Information shall not apply to
copies of Proprietary Information made as a matter of routine information
technology backup or to the retention of Proprietary Information which is
required by any applicable law and/or regulation; _provided_ , that any
information so retained shall only be accessed in order to comply with
applicable Law or regulation or to prove compliance with this Agreement. If
any Seller is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any action or proceeding) to disclose any of the
Proprietary Information, such Seller will, to the extent legally permissible
and practicable, notify the Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so
that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with this _Section 5.5(b)_. Each Seller shall be responsible and liable for
any breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.5(b)_ by it or its
Representatives. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, a Seller is, on the written advice of counsel, required to
disclose any Proprietary Information to any Governmental Authority, such
Seller may disclose the Proprietary Information to the Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with the Buyer to obtain, at the reasonable request and
expense of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Proprietary Information required to be
disclosed as the Buyer shall designate. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.5(b)_ to the contrary, Calera Capital and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to disclose the terms, conditions and Net Purchase Price set forth
in this Agreement and its Schedules, Exhibits, and Annexes, and any ancillary
agreements contemplated herein on a confidential basis to their respective
investors, potential investors, partners, members, officers, employees and
their respective Representatives.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including to (i) obtain from Governmental Authorities and
other Persons all consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations, qualifications
and orders as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and (ii) promptly (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, including providing any supplemental information
which is reasonably requested, with respect to this Agreement required under

for the filing under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law by all parties.

 



 

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents and approvals required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to each Lease, executed by the
landlord under such Lease and confirming such landlords consent to the
transactions contemplated hereunder or otherwise as necessary to permit the
operation of the Leased Real Properties, directly or indirectly, by the Buyer
or the Company after Closing, if required by the terms of the applicable Lease
(the " _Landlord Consents_ "). None of the Sellers, the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any landlord or other third-
party fees and expenses to any landlord or landlords legal counsel or incur
any out-of-pocket expenses, without reimbursement from the Buyer, including
any transfer premiums, or to otherwise reimburse or make any payment to any
landlord or landlords legal counsel or incur any out-of-pocket expenses,
without reimbursement from the Buyer, in respect of obtaining any Landlord
Consent, in each case, whether any such costs, fees, premiums or expenses are
incurred before or after the Closing Date; it being agreed that all such
costs, fees, premiums and expenses shall be repaid by the Buyer; _provided_ ,
that the Buyer shall have no obligation to reimburse the Sellers, the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries for internal costs or expenses (other
than out-of-pocket expenses) or for any expenses of their legal counsel in
conjunction with the foregoing actions. The Buyer shall cooperate with the
Companys efforts to obtain all Landlord Consent and take all actions
reasonably requested in connection therewith, including by providing
guaranties by and from the Buyer in such form as is required under the
applicable Lease and, as to any other matter, as reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer. Unless otherwise agreed by the Buyer and the Company, the Sellers shall
seek Landlord Consents using the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer agrees to take, or cause to be
taken (including by its Affiliates), any and all steps and to make, or cause
to be made (including by its Affiliates), any and all undertakings necessary
to resolve any and all objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority or a
third party may assert under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation
Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the HSR Act) (collectively, "
_Antitrust Laws_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that
may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including (i) promptly supplying any and all additional information and
documents and data and/or responses requested by the Governmental Authority
under any Antitrust Law whether by formal request for information or
otherwise; (ii) obtaining any consents, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required by any Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Law in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) defending any Action undertaken by a Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Law or by third parties to stop, block, delay or
modify the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) appealing any order which
stops, blocks, delays or modifies the terms of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (v) creating, negotiating, committing to and

 



      
 

 



 

effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of some, part or any businesses, Assets, equity
interests, ventures, product lines or properties (including retail stores) of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliate or any equity interest or joint venture held
by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
shall not be required to take such actions under this _Section 5.6(c)_ that
would result in a material adverse effect on the combined business of the
Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section 5.6(c)_ shall require the Buyer
or any of it its Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with respect
to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the Blockers agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyer in order for the
parties to complete all submissions and filings required under Antitrust Law
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and for the Buyer to
resolve any objections or impediments asserted under Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including, as may be
permitted by applicable Law, promptly supplying any and all additional
information and documents and data or responses requested by the Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Law whether by formal request for information or
otherwise; _provided_ , that in connection with such cooperation, none of the
Company, the Blockers or any of their Affiliates shall be required to take any
action (other than providing reasonably requested information, documents and
data) that is not contingent upon the Closing occurring.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and,
subject to applicable Laws including those relating to confidentiality and the
Confidentiality Agreement, permit the other parties to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Subject to applicable Laws including those regarding
confidentiality and the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable
Laws regarding confidentiality and the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties
will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications, including any documents, information and data contained
therewith, between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Companys expense, to obtain a consent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer, to (i)

 



       
 

 



 

the change of control of the Company and the indirect change of control of
Sleepys, LLC from the Nassau County Industrial Development Agency and waiver
of any existing defaults relating to (x) the requirement that Calera Corp. be

case, prior to the Closing Date or promptly thereafter.

 



 

(g) Certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts, to which the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is a party, which have not been and may
not be obtained. Except (i) (A) as expressly provided in _Article VIII_ with
respect to the consents required pursuant to _Section 5.6(f)_ , and (B) as and
to the extent expressly provided in _Article VIII_ with respect to a breach
of any representation or warranty given by the Sellers or the Company
hereunder regarding the requirement to obtain any consent or waiver, none of
the Sellers, the Blockers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
any other Person shall have any liability to the Buyer arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because
of the termination of any contract as a result thereof, and (ii) except with
respect to the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(c)_, no such failure or
termination shall result in the failure of any condition set forth in _Article
VI_.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto shall, without the prior
approval of the other parties hereto, issue any press release or make any
other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such disclosing party shall be
so obligated by Law or securities exchange regulation, in which case the other
parties hereto shall be advised, and the disclosing party shall use its
reasonable efforts to give the other parties advance opportunity to review and
comment on such release or announcement; _provided_ , that the Company shall

Subsidiaries shall be permitted to communicate with their respective vendors
and landlords in the ordinary course of business on matters unrelated to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or to obtain any consents
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the right to create and publish customary
public lender presentations and discuss the information included therein, and,
for the avoidance of doubt, any such discussions or presentations will be

will give due consideration to any comments provided by such Persons in
connection therewith; and (v) the Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the
right to discuss the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in its

Section 5.8 _Covenant Not to Compete_. Adam Blank and David Acker (the "
_Restricted Sellers_ ") acknowledge the highly competitive nature of the
Business of the Company and agree as follows:

 



 

(a) _Restricted Period_. In consideration of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the acquisition of the Companys
goodwill, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), neither of the Restricted Sellers shall, directly or
indirectly (whether as an owner, proprietor, partner, member, shareholder,
officer, employee, independent contractor, director, manager, joint venturer,
consultant, lender or investor), own, maintain, engage in, or participate or
have any interest in the operation of, any retail or internet business engaged
in selling mattresses, bedding or related products within the United States,
including over the internet (collectively, the " _Restricted Activities_ ")
or, without limiting the foregoing, solicit Persons who are vendors of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Blocker as of the Closing Date for the
purpose of soliciting any business of the type that is similar to the Business
from such Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Person,
the running of the Restricted Period shall be tolled during any period of time
during which such Person is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have violated this _Section 5.8_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 5.8(a)_, a Restricted Seller may (i) participate in the
Restricted Activities as an employee of the Buyer or the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) own, maintain, engage in, or participate or have
any interest in any Person as to which no more than 5% of its aggregate annual
revenues are derived from the Business and (iii) own securities in any
publicly held Person that is covered by the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.8(a)_, but only to the extent that such Restricted Seller does not
own, of record or beneficially, more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
beneficial ownership of such Person.

 



 

(b) _Reasonableness_. The Restricted Sellers acknowledge that the Buyer
transacts Business across the United States, and further acknowledge and agree
that the limitations imposed by this _Section 5.8_ as to time, geographical
area, and scope of activity being restrained are reasonable and do not impose
a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other
business interests of the Buyer.

 



 

(c) _Severability_. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this _Section 5.8_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this _Section 5.8_ shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

Section 5.9 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the Buyer will not, for
a period of two (2) years after such date of termination, without the prior
written consent of the Company, either alone or in conjunction with any other
Person, directly or indirectly, or through its present or future Affiliates
(and will cause its Affiliates not to), hire or solicit (other than a

 



      
 

 



 

solicitation by general advertisement) any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who is serving in an officer position or management role, or
cause any such employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Buyer agrees that any remedy at law for any
breach by the Buyer of this _Section 5.9_ would be inadequate, and that the
Sellers and the Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case.
If it is ever held that this restriction on the Buyer is too onerous and is
not necessary for the protection of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, the
Buyer agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser
restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate
properly to protect the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Neither of the Restricted Sellers will, from the date hereof through (i)
the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) if this Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing, for a period of two (2) years after such date of
termination, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, either alone or
in conjunction with any other Person, directly or indirectly, or through his
present or future Affiliates (and will cause his Affiliates not to), hire or
solicit (other than a solicitation by general advertisement or general search
firm engagement) any employee of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries who is
serving in an officer position or management role, or cause any such employee
to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.
Each Restricted Seller agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by such
Person of this _Section 5.9(b)_ would be inadequate, and that the Buyer would
be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this
restriction on the Restricted Sellers is too onerous and is not necessary for
the protection of the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries, each of the Restricted
Sellers agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser
restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate
properly to protect the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Additionally, from the date hereof through (i) the third (3rd) anniversary
of the Closing Date, in the case of the Restricted Sellers, or (ii) the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, in the case of the Blocker Unit
Sellers, no Restricted Seller or Blocker Unit Seller, as applicable, will,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, either alone or in conjunction
with any other Person, directly or indirectly, or through its present or
future Affiliates (and will cause its Affiliates not to), hire or solicit
(other than a solicitation by general advertisement or general search firm
engagement) any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or cause
any such employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not
apply to (x) any Affiliate of the Blocker Unit Sellers or Calera Capital that
is a portfolio company of such Person unless such hiring or solicitation is at
the direction of any Blocker Unit Seller or Calera Capital or (y) to any
Person who ceases to be employed as an officer at least six months prior to
such termination or is terminated by the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries following the Closing. Each Restricted Seller and
Blocker Unit Seller agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by any such
Person of this _Section 5.9(c)_ would be inadequate, and that the Buyer would
be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this
restriction on each Restricted Seller or the Blocker Unit Seller is too
onerous and is not necessary for the protection of the Buyer and/or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company), each Restricted Seller and Blocker Unit
Seller agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser
restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate
properly to protect the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries (including the Company).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide, at the Buyers sole expense, the following reasonable

ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries): (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, rating agency presentations

reasonably requested by the Buyer, and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing the
Buyer and its financing sources with such other information as the Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with satisfying the diligence requirements of
its financing sources and related debt covenants or satisfying federal and
state securities Laws requirements and securities exchange requirements;
_provided_ , that (1) the Company shall not be required to pay any fees (other
than reasonable out of pocket expenses reimbursed by the Buyer hereunder) or
incur any other liability in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement until after the occurrence of the Closing and
none of the Sellers, the Blockers, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fees or incur any other liability in
connection with the financing at any time, (2) none of the Sellers, the
Blockers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives shall be required to deliver or cause the delivery
of any legal opinions or accountants cold comfort letters or reliance letters
or any certificate as to solvency or any other certificate necessary for the
financing, (3) none of the Sellers, the Blockers, the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action relating to the
financing that is not contingent upon the Closing, other than providing
information, documents and data reasonably requested (and the execution by the
Company of any documents in connection with the financing for the transactions
contemplated hereby will be subject to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Closing and such documents will not take effect
prior thereto), and (4) no Representative of any Seller, any Blocker or the
Company shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in or cause any personal liability on the part of any
Representative, unless the Buyer agrees to pay or discharge such liability.
Any information provided or made available to the Buyer or its Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(a)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

(b) None of the Sellers, the Blockers, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall be required to take
any action that would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to
bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make
any other payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide
any indemnity in connection with their performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section 5.10_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers,
the Blockers, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,

 



      
 

 



 

judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the financing of the transactions contemplated herein
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 5.10_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith. The Buyer shall promptly, upon
written request by the Blockers or the Company, reimburse the Blockers, the
Company, the Sellers or the Sellers Representative for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and other amounts incurred by their respective Representatives) incurred
by the Blockers, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Sellers,
the Sellers Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in connection
with the cooperation of such Persons contemplated by this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall cause the Blockers, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer, director or manager of the Blockers, the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against
any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out of or
relating to any threatened or actual Action or investigation based in whole or
in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that

part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and such entitys charter documents to
indemnify its own directors, managers or officers (and the Buyer shall cause
the Blockers, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each DandO
Indemnified Party to the extent permitted by applicable Law and such entitys
charter documents). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
Action or investigation is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether
arising before or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may
retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer,
and the Buyer shall cause the Blockers, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries to, pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) the

Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of
any such matter; _provided_ , that none of the Blockers, the Company, any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or the Buyer shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.11_ shall notify the Buyer upon
learning of any such Action or investigation (but the failure so to notify
shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under this
_Section 5.11_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
party). The parties hereto agree that all rights to indemnification hereunder,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses, existing in favor of
the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the
Closing Date shall continue in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not
permit the Blockers, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to
amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any provision in their respective
certificates of formation or operating agreements, relating to the exculpation
or indemnification (including fee advancement) of any DandO Indemnified Parties
(unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date, a DandO Indemnified Party shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification (including fee advancement)
to the full extent of the Law. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company,
the Companys Subsidiaries and the Blockers to, honor and perform under all
indemnification obligations owed to any DandO Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall purchase a prepaid insurance
policy ( _i.e._ , "tail coverage") which policy provides liability insurance
coverage for the DandO Indemnified Parties on not materially less favorable
terms (including in amount and scope) as the policy or policies maintained by
the Company immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such
individuals for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions that occurred at or
prior to the Closing. Fifty percent (50%) of the cost of such policy (the " _D
andO Tail Coverage Cost_") shall be treated as a Company Transaction Expense.

 



 

(d) Each of the Blockers, the Company and the Buyer covenant, for itself and
its successors and assigns, that it and they shall not institute any Action in
any court or before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal
against any of the current managers, officers or directors of the Blockers,
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, in their capacity as such, with
respect to any liabilities, actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or
demands of any nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive or
otherwise), in each such case to the extent resulting from their approval of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the operation and
conduct of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not prohibit the Buyer,
the Blockers or the Company from bringing any Action against any of the
current directors, officers or managers of the Blockers, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries arising out of or relating to (i) the willful
misconduct of such individual or any felony or criminal conduct of moral
turpitude as to which such individual is convicted or (ii) any breach of this
Agreement by such individual in such individuals capacity as a Seller.

 



 

(e) The rights under this _Section 5.11_ shall be in addition to (and not in
limitation of) any rights such Persons may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Blockers, the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any applicable
contracts or Laws.

 



 

(f) This _Section 5.11_ is intended to benefit and bind the Buyer, the
Blockers, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her

 



      
 

 



 

heirs and representatives, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ whether or not parties to this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made against any DandO
Indemnified Party or any other party covered by directors and officers
liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall continue in effect until
the final disposition of such Action.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide,
or cause to be provided, to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date (the " _Affected Employees_ "), base wages, bonus
opportunities and employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation,
defined benefit pension benefits and post-retirement welfare benefits) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date, subject to such Affected Employees continued employment with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiary under any plan after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees and their covered dependents under such plan (except to the extent
that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
Companys or such Subsidiarys then existing plans absent any change in such
welfare coverage plan) and (ii) provide each Affected Employee and his or her
covered dependents with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and similar
amounts paid prior to any such change in coverage in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such new or changed plan for
the first plan year of such new or changed plan in which such Affected
Employee participates. The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide
each Affected Employee with credit for all service with the Company and its
Affiliates under each employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement in
which such Affected Employee is eligible to participate, except for purposes
of benefits accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of services, to the same extent such service was credited under the
Companys Benefit Plans.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.12_ shall be construed to the Buyer
or the Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans, policies,
programs or arrangements.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall interfere with the rights of the
Company or the Buyer to terminate any Affected Employees employment at any
time with or without notice and with or without cause, interfere with an
employees right to terminate his employment at any time or cause the Company
or the Buyer to provide any Affected Employee

 



      
 

 



 

with any benefits or payments for any period following the Affected Employees
termination of employee except as otherwise required by applicable Laws.

necessary, proper or advisable to freeze and terminate the Company 401(k)
Plan, with the actual effective date of such freeze and termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan to be effective no later than immediately prior to the
Closing. As a result of such freeze and termination of the Company 401(k)
Plan, no compensation payable after the Closing will result in any employee or
employer contribution to the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Closing,
Affected Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan
shall be eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that contains a
feature as described in Section 401(k) of the Code, and the Buyer shall cause
such qualified defined contribution plan to accept as rollovers any
distributions made to Affected Employees who participate in the Company 401(k)
Plan, including distributions of loans, that qualify as eligible rollover
distributions as described in the Code. Any such rollovers, with the
exceptions of loans, shall be made to such qualified defined contribution plan
of the Buyer in cash.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall terminate, in writing, all employment agreements,
consultant agreements, severance agreements and change of control agreements

to Andrea Jane Acker to effect the termination of her consulting agreement in

filing, recording, documentary, stamp or other similar Taxes that arise as a

(" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The parties agree to cooperate fully with each other
to minimize any such liability for Transfer Taxes to the extent legally
permissible, and the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns regarding any Transfer Taxes that become payable in

hereby agree to jointly engage, at the Buyers expense, Houlihan Lokey to
determine the value of such Leases for purposes of calculating the Transfer

Date, provide the Buyer with its calculation of the Transfer Tax amount

entitled to make distributions that are permitted by Section 11.1(a) of the

to, (i) settle or compromise any audit or other proceeding with respect to
income Taxes of the Company for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date or (ii) amend any income Tax Returns of the

required to do so by a Governmental Authority in connection with an audit or
other proceeding with respect to income Taxes of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Diligence Datasite Control_. Immediately upon the Closing, the

(i) not agree to any amendment, variation or waiver of the RandW Insurance
Policy (or do anything which has a similar effect) which would adversely
impact the Sellers without the Sellers Representatives prior written consent;

 



 

(ii) not novate, or otherwise assign its rights under, the RandW Insurance
Policy (or do anything which has similar effect); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Buyer shall have an absolute right, without the Companys, any
Sellers or the Sellers Representatives prior written approval, to assign its

Subsidiary of the Buyer or to any successor to the Buyer by merger,
consolidation or reorganization so long as such assignment does not adversely
impact the Sellers;

 



 

(iii) not terminate the RandW Insurance Policy or do anything which causes any
right under the RandW Insurance Policy not to have full force and effect; and

 



 

(iv) ensure that the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy provide that no insurer
or Person claiming through an insurer in relation to the RandW Insurance Policy
brings any claim against the Sellers or any Seller Indemnified Person by way

for contribution or otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Delivery of Redacted Information_. Within three (3) Business

Section 5.19 _Citi Field License_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and each
of the Restricted Sellers will, and the Company will cause its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyer, at the

satisfactory to the Buyer, of the assignment or transfer, effective at or
after the Closing, of that certain Suite License Agreement dated May 30, 2008,
by and between Queens Ballpark Company, L.L.C and David Acker (the " _License
Agreement_ ") to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer. If the Company and
the Restricted Sellers do not obtain an assignment of the License Agreement
prior to the Closing Date, the Restricted Sellers will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Buyer in such manner as may reasonably be
requested by the Buyer for the purpose of obtaining such consent promptly
after the Closing Date. During such period following the Closing, if any, in
which the License Agreement is not capable of being assigned to the Buyer due
to the failure to obtain any required consent, David Acker will make such
arrangements as may be necessary to enable the Buyer to receive all benefits
under the License Agreement accruing on and after the Closing Date (including,
to the extent permissible, through a sub-contracting, sub-licensing, sub-
participation or sub-leasing arrangement, or an arrangement under which David
Acker would enforce such agreement for the benefit of the Buyer, with the
Buyer, to the extent permissible, assuming David Ackers executory obligations
and any and all rights of David Acker thereunder).

 



 

Section 5.20 _Insurance_. The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to remove all vehicles
owned or leased by a Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries from

foregoing obligation shall not apply with respect to any vehicles leased by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Landlord Notices_. From the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing or the date on which this Agreement terminates, the

the Company, the Blockers and the Companys Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date other than the outstanding hedging obligation with respect to the SOB

Section 5.23 _FIRPTA Withholding_. To the extent that any Seller fails to
deliver the certification or documentation required by such Seller pursuant to
Section 1.5(b)(vi) or Section 1.5(b)(vii), as applicable, the Buyer shall
withhold from the proceeds payable to such Seller hereunder the amounts
necessary to satisfy the Buyers obligations under the Foreign Investment in
Real Property Tax Act of 1980 and will promptly remit such withheld amounts to
the IRS; and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such failure to
deliver the certification or documentation by such Seller shall automatically
be deemed waived by the Buyer and such condition shall be deemed satisfied for
all purposes hereunder (it being expressly agreed that the Buyers sole
recourse with respect to such Sellers failure to deliver the applicable
certification or documentation shall be to so withhold and it shall have no
right not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as a result of
such Sellers failure to deliver the applicable certification or
documentation).

including, for the avoidance of doubt, Sleepys Reorganization, Inc. and (b)
deliver a certificate or other written documentation from the applicable
Secretary of State evidencing such name change.

(a) Effective as of the consummation of the Closing, each Seller hereby
unconditionally, irrevocably, completely, and forever releases, discharges and
acquits each of the Buyer, the Blockers, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns, together with their past and present

Date. In addition, each Seller hereby waives all rights and benefits afforded
by any state Laws that provide in substance that a general release does not
extend to claims which a person does not know or suspect to exist in his, her
or its favor at the time of executing the release which, if known by such
Seller, must have materially affected such Sellers settlement with the other
party. Each Seller acknowledges that such Seller is assuming the risk of such
unknown claims, understands that this _Section 5.25_ applies thereto and
expressly intends to waive such claims to the full extent that such Seller may
lawfully do so.

interests in the Company, any Subsidiary or the Blockers, as applicable, on or

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the releases
granted herein shall not be deemed to release or waive any claim, demand, or
cause of action, or damages and remedies related thereto, arising out of or in
connection with: (A) this Agreement and all documents contemplated or
referenced therein (including without limitation the Escrow Agreement and the
Employment Agreement with Adam Blank) subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, (B) any Seller Partys employment with the Buyer, the Company, any
Blocker or any of their respective parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
successors or assigns following the Closing Date, or (C) events or
circumstances occurring after the Closing Date. In addition, each of the
Buyer, the Company and the Blockers hereby waives all rights and benefits
afforded by any state Laws that provide in substance that a general release
does not extend to claims which a person does not know or

 



      
 

 



 

suspect to exist in his, her or its favor at the time of executing the release
which, if known by the Buyer, the Company or any of the Blockers, must have
materially affected such entitys settlement with the other party. Each of the
Buyer, the Company and the Blockers acknowledges that it is assuming the risk
of such unknown claims, understands that this _Section 5.25_ applies thereto
and expressly intends to waive such claims to the full extent that it may
lawfully do so.

reasonable attorneys fees of outside counsel) from the Seller Released Claims
asserted by or on behalf of such Seller after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Each of the Buyer, the Company and the Blockers hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or

Claims. Each of the Buyer, the Company and the Blockers agrees to indemnify
and defend the Seller Parties and to hold the Seller Parties harmless against
all damages and reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees of outside counsel) from the Company Released Claims asserted
by or on behalf of the Buyer, the Company or any of the Blockers after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Each of the Buyer, the Company, the Blockers and each Seller represents
and agrees that such Person fully understands his, her or its right to discuss
all aspects of this _Section 5.25_ with his, her or its private attorney,
that to the extent, if any, that such Person desires, such Person has availed
himself, herself or itself of this right, that such Person has carefully read
and fully understands all of the provisions of this _Section 5.25_ and that
such Person is voluntarily agreeing to this _Section 5.25_.

 



 

(f) If any term or provision of this _Section 5.25_ or the application hereof
as to any person or circumstance shall to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of this _Section 5.25_ or
the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other
than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be
affected thereby, and each term and provision of this _Section 5.25_ shall be

pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ in respect of which indemnity may be sought

Representatives, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, " _Buyer
Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any losses, liabilities, claims,
obligations, damages, fines, penalties, Actions, judgments, settlements,
violations, or reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and all other reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending any
litigation or proceeding, commenced or threatened) (collectively, " _Buyer

(b) the failure of Company to obtain the consents described in _Section
5.6(f)_.

 



 

Notwithstanding _Section 8.2_, in the event of the breach of a representation
or warranty made by a Seller in _Article III_, only the Seller breaching such
representation or warranty shall be liable for such breach, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Persons_ ") from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, obligations,
damages, fines, penalties, Actions, judgments, settlements, violations or
reasonable out-of-pocket

 



      
 

 



 

costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and all
other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing,
or defending any litigation or proceeding, commenced or threatened)
(collectively, " _Seller Damages_ ," and, together with the Buyer Damages, the
" _Damages_ ") arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Buyer contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. A partys indemnity obligations
under this _Article VIII_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for Buyer Damages for any
matter described under _Section 8.2_ shall not exceed in the aggregate the
Insurance Deductible Escrow Amount. Except with respect to Buyer Damages
arising out of claims pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_, the Sellers shall not
have any liability to the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to Buyer
Damages arising out of any of the matters referred to in _Section 8.2_ until
such time as the amount of all such liability shall exceed in the aggregate
Seven Million Eight Hundred Thousand ($7,800,000) (the " _Seller Deductible_
"), in which case the Sellers shall thereafter be liable for Buyer Damages in
excess of the Seller Deductible, subject to the limits on liability provided
in this _Section 8.4(a)_. The Buyers sole recourse for any Buyer Damages for
any matter described in _Section 8.2_ shall be from the Insurance Deductible
Escrow Fund, and the Buyer shall have no recourse against any Seller for any
matter described in _Section 8.2(a)_ following distribution of the Insurance
Deductible Escrow Fund.

 



 

(b) The maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer for Seller Damages for any
matter described under _Section 8.3_ shall not exceed Seven Million Eight
Hundred Thousand ($7,800,000). The Buyer shall not have any liability to the
Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to Seller Damages arising out of any
of the matters referred to in _Section 8.3_ until such time as the amount of
all such liability shall exceed in the aggregate Seven Million Eight Hundred
Thousand ($7,800,000) (the " _Buyer Deductible_ ") in which case the Buyer
shall thereafter be liable for Seller Damages in excess of the Buyer
Deductible, subject to the limits on liability provided in this _Section
8.4(b)_.

 



 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, the Insurance
Deductible Escrow Fund shall be the sole source of recovery of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons for any amounts owed by the Sellers with respect to Buyer
Damages arising out of any of the matters referred to in _Section 8.2_, and,
once the Insurance Deductible Escrow Fund has been exhausted, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall have no further recourse against the Seller
Indemnified Persons for any such Buyer Damages.

 



 

(d) All materiality qualifications in the representations and warranties will
be disregarded solely for purposes of calculating Buyer Damages or Seller
Damages, as applicable, under this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(e) None of the Buyer Indemnified Persons or the Seller Indemnified Persons
shall be entitled to recover under any provision of this Agreement (i) more
than once for any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, that may
have resulted from the breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement from the

 



      
 

 



 

occurrence of a single event or (ii) for punitive damages, except to the
extent paid to a third party.

 



 

(f) No Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall be entitled
to indemnification hereunder for any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as
applicable, arising from a breach of any representation or warranty to the
extent the Buyer or such Buyer Indemnified Person, or the Sellers or such
Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, would have, with commercially
reasonable efforts, mitigated (to the extent of such mitigation) or prevented
the Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, with respect to such
breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Partys reasonable
election not to defend or protest against any Third Party Claim shall not be
deemed to be a failure to mitigate. No Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any
Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, arising from a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth herein (and the amount of any Buyer
Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, incurred in respect of such breach
shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on indemnification
set forth herein) to the extent such liability is included in the calculation
of the Estimated Net Working Capital and/or the Final Net Working Capital.

 



 

(g) The amount of any and all Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable,
under this _Article VIII_ shall be determined net of any insurance, indemnity
or reimbursement arrangement available to the Indemnified Party in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (each, an "
_Alternative Recovery_ "), other than the RandW Insurance Policy. The
Indemnified Party will seek recovery under all such Alternative Recoveries
with respect to any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, to the
same extent as such Buyer Indemnified Persons would if such Buyer Damages or
Seller Damages, as applicable, were not subject to indemnification hereunder.
Each Indemnified Party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under any
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as
applicable. In the event that the Indemnified Party receives recovery of any
amount pursuant to an Alternative Recovery for which it has already been
indemnified hereunder, the Indemnified Party will promptly refund to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the amount actually paid to such
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party for such matter.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of written notice of the institution of any
Action, or of any other claim, asserted by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") against the Indemnified Party with respect to which a claim for
indemnification is to be made pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_
herein, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the other party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of such Third Party Claim describing in
reasonable detail (i) the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, (ii) the amount or method of computation of the amount of such
claim, (iii) each individual item of Damage included in the amount so stated,
to the extent reasonably practicable, (iv) the date such item was paid or
properly accrued, and (v) the nature of the breach of representation or
warranty with respect to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder (the " _Claim Information_ "), and shall provide any

 



      
 

 



 

other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim ( _provided_ , that if the
Sellers are the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to choose counsel to defend such
Third Party Claim on behalf of the Sellers) with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to such Indemnified Party of such assumption of defense, and provided
that the Indemnifying Party continues to pursue such defense in good faith,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; provided that, after the amounts in the
Insurance Deductible Escrow Fund have been fully disbursed, the Sellers, as
the Indemnifying Party, shall have no further right to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim nor receive notice thereof except to the extent recourse is
being claimed or pursued against the affected Seller(s). No Indemnifying Party
will enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the Indemnified Party ( _provided_ , that if the Sellers are the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to determine whether to provide such consent
on behalf of the Sellers) unless such settlement (i) requires solely the
payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) includes as an
unconditional term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of the proceeding or claim
giving rise to the Third Party Claim. Pending the receipt of notice from the
Indemnifying Party regarding the assumption of defense, the Indemnified Party
may, but shall not be required to, take such steps to defend against such
Third Party Claim as, in the Indemnified Partys good faith judgment, are
appropriate to protect its interests; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party
shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent ( _provided_ , that if
the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to determine whether to provide
such consent on behalf of the Sellers).

 



 

(b) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages which does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by
promptly giving the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof after becoming
aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will contain
Claim Information describing the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, and the
Indemnified Party shall provide any other information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request to the extent practicable. The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30) days within which to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim (the " _Direct Claim Response Period_
"). If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within the Direct Claim
Response Period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted such
claim, in which event the Indemnifying Party will be required to pay such
amounts in accordance with _Section 8.6_ hereof.

 



 

(c) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in
any notice as provided in this _Section 8.5_ will not affect the rights or
obligations of any party hereunder, except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any party which was entitled to receive such notice
was prejudiced or adversely impacted as a result of such failure.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.6 _Payment_. Payment of any amounts due pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days after (a) notice of a final,
non-appealable judgment is sent by the Indemnified Party, (b) a mutually
agreed upon resolution is reached by the third party and the Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnifying Party has approved such resolution, (c) the
expiration of the Direct Claim Response Period or (d) a mutually agreed upon
written resolution is reached by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party. Payment of any amounts due pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, including for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Failure to Pay Indemnification_. Subject to _Section 8.6_, if
and to the extent the Indemnified Party shall make written demand upon the
Indemnifying Party for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and
the Indemnifying Party shall refuse or fail to pay in full within ten (10)
Business Days after the date payment is owed pursuant to _Section 8.6_, then
the Indemnified Party may utilize any legal or equitable remedy to collect
from the Indemnifying Party the amount of its Damages. Interest shall accrue
on any amounts owed to an Indemnified Party and not timely paid by the
Indemnifying Party at the Default Rate and shall constitute additional Damages
payable to the Indemnified Party, subject to the limitations set forth herein.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Recovery; Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this _Article VIII_,
including the Seller Deductible, all indemnification claims under _Section
8.2_ against the Sellers, shall first be paid and satisfied from the Insurance
Deductible Escrow Fund and then against the RandW Insurance Policy, and in no
event shall the Buyer be able to seek any recovery for such claims directly
against any Seller or its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Upon making any indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement, as
applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party or reimbursed party, as applicable, against any third party
in respect of the Damages to which the payment related. The parties hereto
will execute upon request, all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence
and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all contractual claims under this Agreement for any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_. Except in
each case in the case of actual fraud, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives, equityholders,
directors, managers or officers, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_, but subject to the requirement
that all claims by Buyer Indemnified Persons for Buyer Damages pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ are solely recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy and, to
the extent provided herein, the Insurance Deductible Escrow Fund.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
neither _Article VIII_ nor the immediately preceding two sentences apply to
(A) claims against a particular Seller for breaches of any covenants by such
Seller hereunder that by their

 



      
 

 



 

terms contemplate performance in whole or in part after the Closing (other
than the covenant set forth in _Section 5.6(f)_ of this Agreement, which is
subject to this _Article VIII_), to the extent relating to any such breach by
such Seller of its performance obligation following the Closing and such
Seller shall be personally liable for any such breach or (B) claims that any
party has pursuant to _Section 1.4_, and (ii) that each party will be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity for any such
breach.

 



 

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to seek recovery from
the Insurance Deductible Escrow Fund for any Buyer Damages related to breaches
of covenants by any Seller hereunder.

shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. All Exhibits annexed
hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of
this Agreement as if set forth herein. The word "including" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement will mean "including, without
limitation," unless otherwise specified. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall

Section 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules and Disclosure Letters hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Contribution Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings and
all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications
and understandings among the parties with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Notwithstanding any oral agreement
or course of conduct of the parties or their Representatives to the contrary,
no party to this Agreement shall be under any legal obligation to enter into

shall inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting therefrom who are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof. In addition, no provision in
this Agreement shall modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program, or
document (including, for example, a retirement plan) unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision amends such other agreement, plan,
program, or document. The foregoing shall not prevent the parties entitled to
enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no
other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on
the grounds that it is an amendment to another agreement, plan, program, or
document unless the provision is explicitly designated as such in this
Agreement, and the person is otherwise entitled to enforce the other
agreement, plan, program, or document. If a party not entitled to enforce this
Agreement brings an Action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to another agreement, plan, program, or document and that provision
is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated
as an amendment in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal

thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the

Sellers or the Company that such item is or is not material.

this Agreement shall not create or be deemed to create or permit any personal
liability or obligation on the part of any direct or indirect stockholder or

the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
(or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce

 



       
 

 



 

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

had never been contained herein.

Section 10.20 _Legal Representation_. The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blockers, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher
LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ ") has acted as counsel for the Sellers Representative,
the Blockers, the Company and certain of their respective Affiliates
(including certain of the Sellers) for several years and that the Sellers
Representative, those Sellers previously represented by Gibson Dunn and their
respective Affiliates reasonably anticipate that Gibson Dunn will continue to
represent them in future matters. Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blockers, the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries), expressly consents to: (a) Gibson Dunns
representation of the Sellers Representative, those Sellers previously
represented

 



      
 

 



 

by Gibson Dunn and/or their respective Affiliates in any post-Closing matter
in which the interests of the Buyer, the Blockers and the Company (including
any of its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse,
including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto, and whether or not
such matter is one in which Gibson Dunn may have previously advised the
Sellers Representative, those Sellers previously represented by Gibson Dunn,
the Blockers, the Company or their respective Affiliates and (b) the
disclosure by Gibson Dunn to the Sellers Representative, the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates of any information learned by Gibson Dunn in the course
of its representation of the Sellers Representative, those Sellers previously
represented by Gibson Dunn, the Blockers, the Company or their respective
Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to attorney-client
privilege or Gibson Dunns duty of confidentiality. Furthermore, the Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blockers
and the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries) irrevocably waive, from and
after Closing, any right they may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the representation of the Sellers Representative,
those Sellers previously represented by Gibson Dunn, the Blockers and the
Company (including any of its Subsidiaries) or their respective Affiliates by
Gibson Dunn in the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent that such
information or documentation was privileged. The Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blockers and the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries) further covenants and agrees that each shall
not assert any claim against Gibson Dunn in respect of legal services provided
to the Blockers or the Company (including any of its Subsidiaries) or their
respective Affiliates by Gibson Dunn in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Upon and after the Closing, the Blockers and
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-
client relationship with Gibson Dunn, unless and to the extent Gibson Dunn is
specifically engaged in writing by the Blockers or the Company or such
Subsidiary to represent the Blockers or the Company after the Closing and
either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the
Sellers Representative, those Sellers previously represented by Gibson Dunn or
their respective Affiliates or the Sellers Representative, those Sellers
previously represented by Gibson Dunn or their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Blockers, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries by Gibson Dunn after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing
provisions hereof. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to the
Closing, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Blockers and the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries) shall have the right
to waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between the Blockers, the Company (including any of its Subsidiaries) or their
respective Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred at any
time prior to the Closing, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Blockers and the Company (including any of
its Subsidiaries)) shall be entitled to waive such privilege (a) only with the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (b) if the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Blockers and the Company (including any of
its Subsidiaries)) will be materially and adversely affected if such privilege
is not waived.

 



 

Section 10.21 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Buyer, the
Sellers, the Sellers Representative, the Blockers and the Company acknowledges
that each

 



      
 

 



 

party to this Agreement has been represented by legal counsel in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the
drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

 



 

Section 10.22 _Sellers Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller irrevocably appoints the Sellers Representative as such
Sellers representative, agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for all purposes
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the full power and
authority to act on such Sellers behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to the adjustments and
distributions under _Section 1.4_) and the other agreements, instruments and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including
the Escrow Agreement); (ii) to negotiate disputes arising under, or relating
to, this Agreement (including with respect to the adjustments and
distributions under _Section 1.4_) and the other agreements, instruments and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including
the Escrow Agreement); (iii) to calculate any amounts to be received by the
Sellers hereunder or under the Operating Agreement and to receive and disburse
to such Seller any funds received on behalf of the Sellers under this
Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement);
(iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement or any other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement) or
otherwise to satisfy any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by the
Sellers or the Sellers Representative in the performance of its duties
hereunder and thereunder; (v) to execute and deliver any consent, amendment or
waiver to this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including the Escrow
Agreement) (without the prior approval of any of the Sellers); and (vi) to
take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including the Escrow
Agreement). Each of the Sellers further agrees that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Sellers Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Sellers Representative shall require the consent of each
Person constituting the Sellers Representative hereunder and shall be binding
upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Sellers Representative
shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties,
except those set forth herein, and such duties and obligations shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each Seller severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Representative and its Representatives
against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
incurred by such Persons in connection with any Action to which the Sellers
Representative or such other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that
it is or was acting as, or at the direction of, the Sellers Representative
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or

 



      
 

 



 

document contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including the
Escrow Agreement).

 



 

(c) Neither the Sellers Representative nor any of its Representatives shall
incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of such
Persons for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
relating to the performance of their duties hereunder, except for actions or
omissions constituting actual, intentional and knowing fraud. The Sellers
Representative and its Representatives shall have no liability in respect of
any Action brought against such Persons by any Seller, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, if such Persons took or omitted taking any action in good faith.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Representative shall have the right to recover from, in its
sole discretion, the Sellers Representative Escrow Fund and/or the Adjustment
Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Sellers, the Sellers
Representatives (including its Representatives) out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder, including those resulting
from the employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other
advisors and agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and
settlement of any disputes arising under this Agreement or other agreement,
instrument or document contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement) and any fees of the Independent Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section 1.4_ (the " _Charges_ "). In the event the Sellers
Representative Escrow Fund and/or the Adjustment Escrow Fund are insufficient
to satisfy the Charges, then each Seller will be obligated to pay his, her or
its pro rata portion of such deficit (determined in accordance with Section
11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement based on the number and type of Company
Units held immediately prior to the Closing, directly or indirectly, by such
Seller as reasonably determined in good faith by the Sellers Representative).
Following full reimbursement of all Charges, the Sellers Representative shall
distribute to each Seller any remaining portion of the Sellers Representative
Escrow Fund in accordance with _Section 1.4_.

 



 

(e) At any time prior to the distribution of the Sellers Representative Escrow
Fund pursuant to _Section 10.22(d)_ above, a majority-in-interest (determined
in accordance with Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement based on the
number and type of Company Units held immediately prior to the Closing,
directly or indirectly, by such Seller or Sellers) of the Sellers may, by
written consent, appoint a new representative as the Sellers Representative.
Notice together with a copy of the written consent appointing such new
representative and bearing the signatures of the Sellers of a majority-in-
interest of those Sellers must be delivered to the Buyer and each other Seller
not less than ten (10) days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will
be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent and the date
that is ten (10) days after such consent is delivered to the Buyer.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Sellers Representative becomes unable or unwilling
to continue in its capacity as Sellers Representative, or if the Sellers
Representative resigns as the Sellers Representative, a majority-in-interest
of the Sellers may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Sellers Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent appointing
such new representative and bearing the signatures of a majority-in-interest
of the Sellers must be delivered to the Buyer and each Seller. Such
appointment will be effective

 



      
 

 



 

upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent
is received by the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 10.22(e)_), without
its prior written consent, Calera Capital shall only be replaced as a Sellers
Representative hereunder by one of its Affiliates.

 



 

(g) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any action or decision of, or
instruction by, or any document or other paper delivered by, the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers (without any obligation to inquire
into the authority of the Sellers Representative or the genuineness or
correctness of such document or other paper or any signature of the Sellers
Representative), and the Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Buyer in such reliance or with
respect to actions, decisions and determinations of the Sellers
Representative. The Buyer shall not have any right to object to, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blockers, the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries) not to, dissent from, protest or otherwise
contest the authority of the Sellers Representative. Each of the Company, the
Blockers and each Seller hereby waives any claim he, she or it may have or
assert, including those that may arise in the future, against the Sellers
Representative for any action or inaction taken or not taken by the Sellers
Representative in such Persons capacity as Sellers Representative, except to
the extent such action or inaction shall have been held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to constitute actual, intentional and knowing fraud.

whereupon, as and when such Direct Claims or Third Party Claims are finally
resolved from time to time and payment is due in respect thereof pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement, Buyer and Representative shall direct Escrow Agent to
release and pay or deposit, as applicable, appropriate amounts of such
Remaining Balance to the Buyer, applicable Buyer Indemnified Party, Sellers
Representative Escrow Account, as directed by Representative or Buyer (or its
designee(s)), as the case may be.

(b) The terms of Section 10.22 of the Purchase Agreement regarding the
Representative, including but not limited to the liability, indemnification
and authority provisions contained therein, are incorporated herein by

such Order and setting forth instructions to Escrow Agent as to the payment of

shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any such joint written
instructions or Order and shall pay the instructed amount of Insurance
Deductible Escrow Funds (to the extent of the applicable Insurance Deductible
Escrow Funds then held by Escrow Agent) in accordance with such joint written
instructions or written instruction given to effectuate the Order. Escrow
Agent shall not be obligated or liable to confirm the validity of any Order or
the final or non-appealable nature thereof to which such instruction refers or
to make any determination as to whether or not such Order is final, its only
obligation being to rely in good faith on such Order delivered to Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



 

(c) _Release of Sellers Representative Escrow Funds_. Upon receipt of written
instructions executed by an Authorized Representative of Representative
setting forth written instructions to Escrow Agent as to the payment of all or
any portion of the applicable Sellers Representative Escrow Funds in the form

Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any such written

Funds then held by Escrow Agent) in accordance with such written instructions.

 



 

(d) _Disbursements of Earnings_. On the last Business Day of each calendar

full amount of the Deposit by Escrow Agent in accordance with _Sections 5_ and
_6_ or any other provision hereof, this Agreement shall terminate and the
related account(s) shall be closed and have no further force and effect,
subject to the provisions of _Section 11_ hereof.

 



 

 **8.** **Escrow Agent s Rights and Responsibilities**. Escrow Agent agrees
to hold the Deposit and to perform its obligations in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties agree that Escrow Agent
shall not assume any responsibility for the failure of the Parties to perform
in accordance with the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement and Escrow Agent
has no knowledge of, nor any obligation to comply with, the terms and
conditions of any other agreement between the Parties. The acceptance by
Escrow Agent of its responsibilities hereunder is subject to the following
terms and conditions, which the Parties agree shall govern and control with
respect to Escrow Agents rights, duties and liabilities hereunder:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Documents_. Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document furnished
to it in accordance with the terms hereof, not only as to its due execution
and validity and the effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth
and accuracy of any information therein contained, which Escrow Agent in good
faith believes to be genuine and what it purports to be. Should it be
necessary for Escrow Agent to act upon any instructions, directions, documents
or instruments issued or signed by or on behalf of any corporation,
partnership, fiduciary or individual acting on behalf of a Party, it may be
necessary for Escrow Agent to inquire into such corporations, partnerships,
fiduciarys or individuals authority; _provided_ that Escrow Agent believes
in good faith that the authority of such entity or individual is genuine.
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any beneficiary or other person
for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth, claiming,
containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution of the
Deposit, or any portion thereof, unless such instruction shall have been
delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 26_ below and Escrow
Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be
required thereunder.

 



 

(b) _Liability_. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken in good faith, except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow
Agents gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or fraud was the
direct cause of any loss to either Party. No party to this Agreement is liable
to any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its
obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire,
war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission
failure, or other similar causes reasonably beyond its control. Escrow Agent
shall have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided
herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other
duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be implied.
Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties
hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. In the event that Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties
or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Agreement, or, with respect to the Adjustment Escrow Account or the
Insurance Deductible Escrow Account, if Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from the Parties, it shall be entitled to (i) refrain from taking
any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held
in escrow until it shall be given (A) joint written instructions executed by
an Authorized Representative of each of Buyer and Representative, which
eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent or
(B) an Order (it being understood that Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely and act upon any such Order and shall have no obligation
to determine whether any such Order is final); or (ii) file an action in
interpleader. With respect to the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Insurance
Deductible Escrow Account, the Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse
in connection with any dispute between them without making Escrow Agent a
party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless
of the form of action.

 



 

(c) _Legal Counsel_. Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from,
legal counsel in the event of any question as to any of the provisions hereof
or its duties hereunder, and, except as provided in _Section 8(b)_ hereof, it
shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith
in accordance with the opinion and instructions of such counsel.

 



 

(d) _Limitation of Duties_. Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those
which are expressly set forth herein and it shall not be bound by any
agreement of the Parties (whether or not it has any knowledge thereof) other
than this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Resignation or Termination of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent shall have the
right to resign at any time by giving at least 30 days advance written notice
of such resignation to the Parties, and the Parties shall have the right to
terminate the services of Escrow Agent, with or without cause, at any time by
giving at least 30 days advance written notice (with such written notice
being signed by an Authorized Representative of each of Buyer and
Representative) of such termination to Escrow Agent, in each case specifying
the effective date of such resignation or termination. Escrow Agents sole
responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to
hold the Deposit (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver
the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the
Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with
the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, Escrow
Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. With respect to the
Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Insurance Deductible Escrow Funds, within five
Business Days after receiving or delivering such notice, as the case may be,
the Parties agree to jointly appoint a successor Escrow Agent to which Escrow
Agent shall disburse the Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Insurance Deductible
Escrow Funds then held hereunder. With respect to the Sellers Representative
Escrow Funds, within five Business Days after receiving or delivering such
notice, as the case may be, Representative agrees to appoint a successor
Escrow Agent to which Escrow Agent shall disburse the Sellers Representative
Escrow Funds then held hereunder or to have the such funds distributed to
Representative to be held in escrow for the benefit of the Sellers as provided
in the Purchase Agreement. If a successor Escrow Agent has not been appointed
or has not accepted such appointment by the end of such 30-day termination or
removal period, Escrow Agent may (i) to the extent there are Adjustment Escrow
Funds or Insurance Deductible Escrow Funds remaining at such time, interplead
the Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Insurance Deductible Escrow Funds, as
applicable, with a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware
for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in connection with
such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Adjustment
Escrow Funds or Insurance Deductible Escrow Funds. As between the Parties, the
costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in
connection with any such proceeding shall be shared equally by Buyer, on the
one hand, and Representative, on the other hand; (ii) to the extent there are
Sellers Representative Escrow Funds remaining at such time, interplead the
Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Representative Escrow Funds with a court of competent jurisdiction in the
State of Delaware for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the
out-of-pocket costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which are
incurred in connection with any such proceeding shall be charged against and
withdrawn from the Sellers Representative Escrow Funds; or (iii) appoint a
successor escrow agent of its own choice. Any appointment of a successor
escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed successor
escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent.

 



 

(f) _Discharge of Escrow Agent_. Upon disbursement of all of the Deposit
pursuant to the terms of _Sections 5_ and _6_ above or delivery thereof to a
successor escrow agent in accordance with this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall
thereafter be discharged from any further obligations hereunder, except
pursuant to _Section 8(b)_. With respect to the Adjustment Escrow Account and
the Insurance Deductible Escrow Account, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in
any and all events, to comply with and obey any and all Orders and, if it
shall so comply or obey, it shall not be liable to any other person or entity
by reason of such compliance or obedience.

 



 

 **9.** **Income Tax Reporting.**

 



 

(a) Buyer and Representative shall each furnish Escrow Agent with an IRS Form
W-8 or IRS Form W-9. The Parties hereby represent to Escrow Agent that no tax
reporting of any kind is required given the underlying transaction giving rise
to this Agreement

 



 

 **10.** **Indemnification**. The Parties agree jointly and severally to
indemnify and defend Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective
successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (" ** _Indemnitees_** ")
from and to hold them harmless against any losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations,
costs, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including without limitation
reasonable out-of-pocket outside attorneys fees and expenses) (other than the
normal administrative and other costs associated with acting as an escrow
agent, for which Escrow Agent shall be compensated in accordance with _Section
11_) (collectively " ** _Losses_** ") arising out of or in connection with (i)
Escrow Agents performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding,
the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of any
Indemnitee, or (ii) Escrow Agents following, accepting or acting upon any
instructions or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties
received in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, except in the case of
any Indemnitee to the extent that such Losses are finally adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the bad faith, fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The Parties hereby
grant Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security interest
in the Deposit for the payment of any indemnification, fees, expenses and
amounts determined to be due to Escrow Agent or an Indemnitee hereunder. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and
directed, but shall not be obligated, to charge against and withdraw from the
Deposit for its own account or for the account of an Indemnitee any amounts
due to Escrow Agent or to an Indemnitee under Section 10 or 11. The indemnity
obligations set forth in this _Section 10_ shall survive the resignation,
replacement or removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **11.** **Escrow Costs**.

 



 

(a) Escrow Agent shall be paid reasonable fees for the services to be rendered
hereunder and shall be reimbursed for certain reasonable, out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in accordance with the performance of such services, which
fees and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses are set forth on _Schedule B_
attached hereto. Buyer will pay 50% of such fees and expenses and
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall pay the other 50% of such fees
and expenses; _provided_ that after disbursement of the entire Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Insurance Deductible Escrow Amount, Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall pay 100% of such fees and expenses.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set
forth in _Schedule B_.

 



 

 **12.** **Limitations on Rights to Escrow Funds**. Neither of the Parties
shall have any right, title or interest in or to, or possession of, the
Deposit and therefore shall not have the ability to pledge, convey or
hypothecate all or any portion of the Deposit, unless and until such Deposit
has been disbursed pursuant to _Section 5_ and _Section 6_ above.

 



 

 **13.** **Notices**. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 26_ below, all
communications hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF
(hereinafter defined) attached to an email, and all such communications from a
Party to another Party or from a Party or the Parties to Escrow Agent shall be
executed by an Authorized Representative, and shall be delivered in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement by facsimile, to the extent one is provided

Any party hereto may change the address to which notices, requests, claims,
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
parties hereto prior written notice thereof in the manner herein set forth in
this _Section 13_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **14.** **Entire Agreement; Amendments**. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Parties, on the one hand, and Escrow Agent, on the other
hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
understandings or agreements by or between the Parties, on the one hand, and
Escrow Agent, on the other hand, whether written or oral, that may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way. This Agreement may be
amended, or any provision of this Agreement may be waived, so long as such
amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by each of the Parties
and Escrow Agent. No course of dealing between the Parties shall be deemed
effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any
rights or obligations of any party hereto under or by reason of this
Agreement. Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any obligation to comply
with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Parties
**,** nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Party has
complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, as between the Parties, if there is an inconsistency between
the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement,
the provisions of the Purchase Agreement will control.

 



 

 **15.** **Assigns and Assignment**. This Agreement may not be assigned
without the prior consent of Escrow Agent and each of the Parties, but all
actions taken hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding
upon the Parties and Escrow Agent and upon all of their respective successors
and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Escrow Agent shall not be permitted
to assign its obligations hereunder except as provided in _Section 8(e)_
hereof and except to any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or
consolidated or to any entity to whom Escrow Agent may transfer all or
substantially all of its escrow business as long as such entity assumes in
writing all of the obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder. Furthermore, Escrow
Agent must be satisfied with all required Patriot Act, Know Your Customer,
Anti-Money Laundering, and other information delivered by the assigning Party,
including new contact information for notices, new funds transfer instructions
and an updated _Schedule C_ , prior to such assignment becoming effective and
allow a reasonable amount of time for Escrow Agent to perform its due
diligence involving the review of such information.

 



 

 **16.** **No Other Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing herein expressed or
implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give any party
other than Escrow Agent, the Parties and their permitted assigns any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

 **17.** **Interpretation**. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be a part of or control or affect
the meaning hereof.

 



 

 **18.** **No Waiver**. No waiver by any party hereto of any default by any
other party hereto in the performance of any provision, condition, or
requirement herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any manner release
the defaulting party from, performance of any other provision, condition, or
requirement herein, nor shall such waiver be deemed to be a waiver of, or in
any manner a release of, the defaulting party from future performance of the
same provision, condition, or requirement. Any delay or omission of any party
hereto to exercise any right hereunder shall not impair the exercise of any
such right, or any like right, accruing to it thereafter. The failure of any
party hereto to perform its obligations hereunder shall not release the other
parties hereto from the performance of such obligations.

 



      
 

 



 

 **19.** **Severability**. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof,
_provided_ that any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation or in any jurisdiction will not affect the
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 **20.** **No Strict Construction**. The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
collective mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party hereto. The term "including" as used herein shall be by way
of example, and shall not be deemed to constitute a limitation of any term or
provision contained herein. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

 



 

 **21.** **Disbursements on Non-Business Days**. In the event that a
disbursement of the Deposit hereunder is required to be made on a date that is
not a Business Day, such release may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force and effect as if made when required. " ** _Business
Day_** " means any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which
banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in New York, New York.

 



 

 **22.** **Governing Law**. The legal relations between the Parties, on the
one hand, and Escrow Agent, on the other hand, with respect hereto shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of
Delaware without regard or giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of such state or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than such state.
Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury
with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising under this
Agreement that involves Escrow Agent, on the one hand, and either or both of
the Parties, on the other hand.

 



 

 **23.** **Choice of Forum**. Any dispute, controversy, claim, or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement involving Escrow Agent, on the
one hand, and either or both of the Parties, on the other hand, each as
amended from time to time, including regarding the validity or effect of this
Agreement or the performance, validity, interpretation, application, or
termination hereof, shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in
the City of Wilmington, State of Delaware. With respect to all such disputes,
controversies, claims, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement
involving Escrow Agent, on the one hand, and either or both of the Parties, on
the other hand, each of the Parties and Escrow Agent (a) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such dispute,
controversy, claim, or action, (b) waives any objection it may now or
hereafter have to venue or to an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that all such
disputes, controversies, claims, and actions shall be heard and determined
only in such courts, and (d) agrees not to bring any dispute, controversy,
claim, or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any documents
contemplated hereby in any other court. To the extent that in any jurisdiction
either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its
assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment)
or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and hereby irrevocably
waives, such immunity.

 



      
 

 



 

 **24.** **Counterparts**. This Agreement and any joint instructions may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile transmission (whether directly from one facsimile device to another
by means of a dial-up connection or whether otherwise transmitted via
electronic transmission), by electronic mail in "portable document format" ("
** _PDF_** ") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, or by a combination
of such means, shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and Escrow Agent and may be used in lieu of an
original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties and Escrow
Agent transmitted by facsimile, PDF attached to an email, or other electronic
transmission shall be deemed to be original signatures of each party whose
signature it reproduces and shall be binding upon such party for all purposes.
Minor variations in the form of signature pages of this Agreement, including
footers from earlier versions of this Agreement, shall be disregarded in
determining any intent of a Party or Escrow Agent or the effectiveness of such
signature.

 



 

 **25.** **Security Procedures**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in _Section 13_, any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing,
objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of funds,
must be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an email, executed by the
appropriate Party or Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
may be given to Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile or by emailed PDF and
no instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Deposit,
or any portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered and effective unless Escrow
Agent actually shall have received such instruction by facsimile or by emailed
PDF at the number or email provided to the Parties by Escrow Agent in
accordance with _Section 13_ and as further evidenced by a confirmed
transmittal to that number or email address and Escrow Agent has been able to
satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder.
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for refraining
from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Deposit if delivered to any other fax number or email
address including but not limited to a valid email address of any employee of
Escrow Agent other than in accordance with _Section 13_.

 



 

(a) In the event funds transfer instructions are so received by Escrow Agent
by facsimile or emailed PDF, which has been executed by the appropriate Party
or Parties as evidenced by the signature of the person or persons executing
this Agreement or one of their designated persons set forth on the Designation
of Authorized Representatives attached hereto as _Schedules C-1_ and _C-2_
(each an " ** _Authorized Representative_** "), Escrow Agent is authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on such _Schedule C-1_ and _C-2_ hereto, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be an Authorized
Representative. Each Designation of Authorized Representatives shall be signed
by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or other duly authorized officer of
the named Party. The person(s) executing this Agreement on such Partys behalf
and certifying Authorized Representatives in the applicable _Schedule C-1_ and
_C-2_ have been duly and properly authorized to do so, and each Authorized
Representative of such Party has been duly and properly authorized to take the
actions specified for such person in the applicable _Schedule C-1_ and _C-2_.
A Party may change its respective persons and

 



       
 

 



 

telephone numbers for call-backs only in a writing actually received and
acknowledged by Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent, any intermediary bank and the
beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely upon the identifying number
of the beneficiarys bank or any intermediary bank included in the funds
transfer instruction provided by the relevant Party or Parties and confirmed
by an Authorized Representative. Further, the beneficiarys designated bank in
the funds transfer instructions may make payment on the basis of the account
number provided in such Partys or the Parties instruction and confirmed by
an Authorized Representative, even though it identifies a person different
from the named beneficiary. No funds will be disbursed until an Authorized
Representative is able to confirm such instructions by telephone callback.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that Escrow Agent is authorized to use the following
funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to Buyer under this
Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth in _Section 25(a)_
above:

 



    

Buyers Bank account information:

 |  

Bank name:

 |  


 
---|---|--- 
   



 |

 |  

Account name:

Representative acknowledges that Escrow Agent is authorized to disburse any
funds due to the Representative, on behalf of and for the benefit of the
Sellers under this Agreement, and shall perform a verifying call-back as set
forth in _Section 25(a)_ to the bank account or bank accounts designated in
writing by the Representative.

 



 

(c) In addition to their respective funds transfer instructions as set forth
in _Section 25(b)_ above, the Parties acknowledge that repetitive funds
transfer instructions may be given to Escrow Agent for one or more
beneficiaries where only the date of the requested transfer, the amount of
funds to be transferred, and/or the description of the payment shall change
within the repetitive instructions (" ** _Standing Settlement Instructions_**
"). Accordingly, the Parties shall deliver to Escrow Agent such specific
Standing Settlement Instructions only for each respective beneficiary, by
facsimile or PDF attached to an email in accordance with this _Section 25_.
Any such Standing Settlement Instructions shall be set up in writing in
advance of any actual transfer request and shall contain complete funds
transfer information (as set forth above) for the beneficiary. Any such set-up
of Standing Settlement Instructions (other than those established concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement), and any changes in existing set-up,
shall be confirmed by means of a verifying callback to an Authorized
Representative. Standing Settlement Instructions will continue to be followed
until cancelled by the Parties jointly in a writing signed by an Authorized
Representative and delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section.
Once set up as provided herein, Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such
Standing Settlement Instructions and all identifying information set forth
therein for each beneficiary. Escrow Agent may rely

 



      
 

 



 

solely upon such Standing Settlement Instructions and all identifying
information set forth therein for each beneficiary. The Parties agree that
such Standing Settlement Instructions shall be effective as the funds transfer
instructions of the Parties, without requiring a verifying callback, as set
forth in Section 25(a), if such Standing Settlement Instructions are
consistent with previously authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions for
that beneficiary.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the internet and the Parties hereby expressly assume such
risks. Furthermore, the Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set
forth in this _Section 25_ are commercially reasonable.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any funds
transfer instructions from Representative under this Agreement shall require
the authorization of at least one Authorized Representative that is an "Acker
Representative" (as indicated in _Schedule C-2_ , as may be modified from time
to time in accordance with the terms hereof) and at least one Authorized
Representative that is a "Calera Representative" (as indicated in _Schedule
C-2_ , as may be modified from time to time in accordance with the terms
hereof).

 



 

 **26.** **Compliance with Court Orders**. In the event that any escrow
property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or
the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or
any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to
any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

 



 

 **27.** **Patriot Act Disclosure**. Section 326 of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" ** _USA PATRIOT Act_** ") requires Escrow
Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person
that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and Escrow Agents identity verification
procedures require Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to
confirm the Parties identities including name, address and organizational
documents (" ** _identifying information_** "). The Parties agree to provide
Escrow Agent with and consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any
such identifying information required as a condition of opening an account
with or using any service provided by Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **28.** **Information**. The Parties authorize Escrow Agent to disclose
information with respect to this Agreement and the account(s) established
hereunder, the Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such disclosure is:
(i) necessary or desirable, in Escrow Agents opinion, for the purpose of
allowing Escrow Agent to perform its duties and to exercise its powers and

 



      
 

 



 

rights hereunder; (ii) to a proposed assignee of the rights of Escrow Agent;
(iii) to a branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of Escrow Agent or
to their auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any competent court;
(iv) to the auditors of any of the Parties; or (v) permitted or required by
applicable law, regardless of whether the disclosure is made in the country in
which each Party resides, in which the escrow account is maintained, or in
which the transaction is conducted. The Parties agree that such disclosures by
Escrow Agent and its affiliates may be transmitted across national boundaries
and through networks, including those owned by third parties.

Based upon our current understanding of your proposed transaction, our fee
proposal is as follows:

 



    

 **Account Acceptance Fee**

 |  



 |  

Waived

 |  


 
---|---|---|--- 
 



 

Encompassing review, negotiation and execution of governing documentation,

 **Extraordinary Services and Out-of-Pocket Expenses**

 



 

Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, and

fees and expenses will be considered extraordinary services for which related
costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at Escrow
Agents then standard rate. Disbursements, receipts, investments or tax
reporting exceeding 25 items per year may be treated as extraordinary services
thereby incurring additional charges. Escrow Agent may impose, charge, pass-

services provided by Escrow Agent, including but not limited to, transaction,
maintenance, balance-deficiency, and service fees, agency or trade execution
fees and other charges, including those levied by any governmental authority.

* Payment of the invoice is due upon receipt.

 

* The Deposit shall be continuously invested in non-interest bearing JPMorgan Money Market Deposit Account ("MMDA"). MMDAs have rates of interest or compensation that may vary from time to time as determined by Escrow Agent.

 



 

 _Schedule B to 
Escrow Agreement_

      
 

 



 

 **Disclosures and Agreements**

 



 

 **Representations Relating to Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Rule 15Ba1-1 et seq.) (the " _Municipal Advisor Rule_ ")**. Each Party
represents and warrants to Escrow Agent that for purposes of the Municipal
Advisor Rules, none of the funds (if any) currently invested, or that will be
invested in the future, in money market funds, commercial paper or treasury
bills under this Agreement constitute or contain (i) proceeds of municipal
securities (including investment income therefrom and monies pledged or
otherwise legally dedicated to serve as collateral or a source or repayment
for such securities) or (ii) municipal escrow investments (as each such term
is defined in the Municipal Advisor Rule). Each Party also represents and
warrants to Escrow Agent that the person providing this certification has
access to the appropriate information or has direct knowledge of the source of
the funds to be invested to enable the forgoing representation to be made.
Further, each Party acknowledges that Escrow Agent will rely on this
representation until notified in writing otherwise.

 



 

 **Patriot Act Disclosure.** Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 (" ** _USA PATRIOT Act_** ") requires Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of
the USA PATRIOT Act and Escrow Agents identity verification procedures
require Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm your
identity including without limitation name, address and organizational
documents (" ** _identifying information_** "). You agree to provide Escrow
Agent with and consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such
identifying information required as a condition of opening an account with or
using any service provided by Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **OFAC Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of
money laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not
limited to regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Escrow Agent is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other
transaction where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with
whom Escrow Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation
applicable to Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow
Agents opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own
policies and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order
or effect a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action
required by any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including,
without limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may
result in delays in the posting of transactions.

 



 

 **Abandoned Property**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with
the laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property and,
accordingly, shall be entitled to remit dormant funds to any state as
abandoned property in accordance with such laws and regulations.

 



 

 **THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE**

      
 

 



 

 **NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY
OTHER INVESTMENT.**

 



 

 **Demand Deposit Account Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is authorized, for
regulatory reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow
demand deposit account maintained in the U.S. in which the Deposit is held
into a non-interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest
bearing savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis
between these internal accounts on Escrow Agents general ledger in accordance
with U.S. law at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal
accounts and any transfers between them on Escrow Agents books and records
only. The internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the
Deposit, any investment or disposition of the Deposit, use of the escrow
demand deposit account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as
described herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the demand
deposit internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds
in the demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess
will be transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number
of transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or
statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit
internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal
account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to the
demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available funds in
the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish any
target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the demand deposit
internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or
statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings internal
account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal account for
the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

 



 

 **Money Market Deposit Account Disclosure and Agreement**. If a Money Market
Deposit Account (" ** _MMDA_** ") is the investment for the escrow deposit as
set forth above or anytime in the future, you acknowledge and agree that U.S.
law limits the number of pre-authorized or automatic transfers or withdrawals
or telephonic/electronic instructions that can be made from an MMDA to a total
of six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle or similar period. Escrow
Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the right to require at least seven
(7) days notice prior to a withdrawal from a money market deposit account.

 



 

 **Unlawful Internet Gambling**. The use of any account to conduct
transactions (including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of
funds through an electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar
instrument, or the proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related,
directly or indirectly, to unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.
