statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") consisting of a calculation

Cristal, prepared in good faith and in accordance with the Accounting
Principles set forth in _Exhibit D_ and in the form of the illustrative
calculation set forth in _Exhibit G_. Cristal shall provide to Tronox and its

any other information, including such access to the Transferred Employees and

such accountants agreeing to, a customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants),
as Tronox shall reasonably request in connection with Tronox's review of the
Estimated Closing Statement and preparation of the Closing Statement. Tronox
may object to the amounts contained in the Estimated Closing Statement within
two Business Days after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement to
Tronox. Cristal shall in good faith consider the objections, if any, of Tronox
to the Estimated Closing Statement and, if Cristal determines in good faith
that revisions are appropriate, re-issue an Estimated Closing Statement
containing the Estimated Adjustment Amount no later than one Business Day
prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

 

5  

  

(b) _Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date
(but in any event within 90 days thereafter), Tronox shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to Cristal a statement (the " _Closing Statement_
") consisting of a calculation in reasonable detail (including calculation of
the Closing Working Capital, Closing Other Non-Current Liabilities and Closing
Cash) of (i) the Adjustment Amount, if any, and (ii) the amount, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 1.08(g)_. The Closing Statement shall be signed
by a duly authorized officer of Tronox, prepared in good faith and in
accordance with the Accounting Principles set forth in _Exhibit D_ and in the
form of the illustrative calculation set forth in _Exhibit G_.

  


 

  

(c) _Access to Information_. Tronox shall provide, or caused to be provided,
to Cristal and its Representatives such access to the books and records of the
Business and to any other information, including such access to employees of
the Business and work papers of the accountants who compiled or reviewed the
Closing Statement or the underlying accounting data (subject to Cristal
entering into, and such accountants agreeing to, a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants), as Cristal shall reasonably request, in
connection with Cristal's review of the Closing Statement.

  


 

  

(d) _Closing Statement Dispute Notice_. The Closing Statement shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon Cristal and Tronox on the 45th day
following Tronox's delivery of the Closing Statement unless Cristal delivers
to Tronox on or prior to such 45th day a written notice (a " _Closing
Statement Dispute Notice_ ") stating that Cristal disputes one or more items
contained in the Closing Statement (a " _Disputed Item_ ") and specifying in
reasonable detail each Disputed Item. If Cristal timely delivers a Closing
Statement Dispute Notice, all items in the Closing Statement that are not
Disputed Items shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Tronox and Cristal
for all purposes hereunder except for any such items that must be changed or
adjusted as a direct consequence of a change or adjustment to a Disputed Item.

  


 

  

(e) _Resolution Period_. If Cristal timely delivers a Closing Statement
Dispute Notice, then Tronox and Cristal shall seek in good faith to resolve
the Disputed Items during the 30-day period beginning on the date Tronox
receives the Closing Statement Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ ").
If Tronox and Cristal reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Items,
Tronox shall revise the Closing Statement to reflect such agreement.

  

  

 

6  

  

(f) _Independent Accountant_. If Tronox and Cristal are unable to resolve all
Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then, at the request of either
Party, Tronox and Cristal shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved
Disputed Items (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to such firm of independent
accountants of internationally recognized standing as Cristal and Tronox agree
(the " _Independent Accountant_ "). Tronox and Cristal shall enter into
reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the
Independent Accountant, including a customary non-disclosure agreement. Tronox
and Cristal shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items
within 30 days after such items are submitted to it for resolution. The
Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The
Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the
Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this _Section 1.08_ and
the Accounting Principles. The Independent Accountant shall limit its review
only to the Unresolved Items. In reviewing any Unresolved Items, the
Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any Unresolved Item that is
greater than the greatest value or less than the smallest value for such
Unresolved Item claimed by either Party. As an initial procedural matter, each
Party shall no later than five Business Days after the Independent Accountant
has been retained prepare a statement which it shall deliver to the
Independent Accountant setting forth its position regarding the Unresolved
Items. Such statement shall be accompanied by such supporting documentation as
the Party preparing the same may care to submit. After the Independent
Accountant has received both statements, the Parties shall cause the
Independent Accountant to simultaneously provide such statements to both
Parties (including all accompanying exhibits and schedules). Following
delivery of the Parties\' statements of position, the Parties shall have the
opportunity to schedule a joint meeting with both Parties and the Independent
Accountant so each Party may present its evidence and the Independent
Accountant may ask any questions regarding the Parties\' respective positions.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant may ask questions
regarding the Parties' respective positions both at the meeting or at any time
after (but prior to the Independent Accountant\'s delivery of its
determination referred to below). Following the meeting with the Independent
Accountant (but no more than ten Business Days after), the Parties may (using
the same procedure specified above with respect to the preparation and
submission of the initial position statements) submit a final statement of
position (together with the initial statements, the " _Position Statements_
"). Except as specified above regarding the delivery of the Parties\' Position
Statements to the Independent Accountant, all communications between either
Party and the Independent Accountant or from the Independent Accountant to
either Party shall copy the other, and no ex-parte communications or meetings
shall be permitted. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be
based solely on (x) the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, (y) the Parties' respective Position Statements and (z) the meeting
referred to above and follow up questions therefrom (and not on an independent
review), and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Tronox and Cristal absent manifest error. The fees, expenses and costs of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by Cristal and Tronox in the same
proportion as the aggregate amount of the Unresolved Items that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each (as determined by the Independent Accountant)
bears to the total amount of the Unresolved Items submitted to the Independent
Accountant.

  

  

 

7  

  

(g) _Final Adjustment_. If (i) the Adjustment Amount (A) as set forth on the
Closing Statement delivered by Tronox to Cristal if Cristal does not timely
deliver a Closing Statement Dispute Notice pursuant to _Section 1.08(d)_ , (B)
as agreed by Tronox and Cristal pursuant to _Section 1.08(e)_ , or (C) as
determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant to _Section 1.08(f)_ (as
applicable, the " _Actual Adjustment Amount_ ") exceeds the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, then Tronox shall pay to Cristal an amount in cash equal to
such excess, or (ii) the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Actual
Adjustment Amount, then Cristal shall pay to Tronox an amount in cash equal to
such excess.

  


 

  

(h) _Sole Remedy_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 1.08_ shall serve
as the sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owed to Cristal
or Tronox in connection with the determination of the Actual Adjustment Amount
and any payments in connection therewith.

  


 

  

(i) _Method of Payment_. Any amount paid pursuant to _Section 1.08(g)_ shall
be made within five Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final
pursuant to _Section 1.08(d)_ , _Section 1.08(e)_ or _Section 1.08(f)_ by wire
transfer of immediately available cash funds to an account designated by the
receiving Party.

  


 

  

Section 1.09 _Withholding_. Tronox, Cristal and/or their applicable Affiliates
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to Cristal and/or its applicable
Affiliates, and other payments pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
Tronox, Cristal and/or their applicable Affiliates are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of any other U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law. To the extent that such amounts are withheld by Tronox, Cristal and/or
their applicable Affiliates, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom or for
whose account the Agreement requires the applicable payment to be made. Tronox
or Cristal, as applicable, shall (a) promptly notify the other Party of any
anticipated withholding in respect of the Consideration, (b) consult with the
other Party in good faith to determine whether such deduction and withholding
is required under applicable Tax Law, and (c) cooperate with the other Party
in good faith to minimize the amount of any applicable withholding (including
by cooperating in respect of an application for a Variation Notice related to
any Australian withholding Tax in respect of any of the Acquired Shares, and
by working in good faith to restructure the Transactions to the extent
necessary to reduce or eliminate the aggregate amount of such withholding
Tax). Notwithstanding the foregoing (and notwithstanding _Section 10.02_ ), to
the extent any Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from (or, in the
case of Transfer Taxes or VAT, are imposed on) the Consideration solely as a
result of an assignment by Tronox of any of its rights or obligations pursuant
to _Section 12.11_ to an Affiliate (other than, (i) in the case of the sale
and purchase of the Transferred Assets, an assignment to an Affiliate that is
an entity formed in the United States, and (ii) in the case of the sale and
purchase of the Yanbu Securities, an assignment to an Affiliate that is an
entity formed in the United Kingdom), Tronox shall pay (or cause to be paid)
such additional amounts as necessary so that after such deduction, withholding
or payment of Taxes has been made (including in respect of additional amounts
described in this sentence), Cristal or the Seller, as applicable, receives an
amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deduction,
withholding or payment of Taxes been made. Tronox and Cristal agree to, and to
cause their applicable Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith to minimize the
amount of any applicable withholding with respect to any other payment
pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to any
assignment that is agreed to by the parties in accordance with this _Section
1.09_ or that occurs pursuant to _Section 10.09_ of this Agreement.

Restructuring in accordance with the steps set forth in Exhibit E.

 _Representations and Warranties of Tronox_

  


 

  

Tronox represents and warrants to Cristal that the statements contained in
this _Article III_ are true and correct except as set forth in the Tronox SEC
Documents filed and publicly available at least five Business Days prior to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Tronox SEC Documents_ ") (excluding
any disclosures in the Filed Tronox SEC Documents in any risk factors section,
in any section related to forward-looking statements and other disclosures
that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure letter
delivered by Tronox to Cristal at or before the execution and delivery by
Tronox of this Agreement (the " _Tronox Disclosure Letter_ "). The Tronox
Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article
III_ , and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other
sections in this _Article III_ to the extent (and only to the extent) that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other sections (other than _Section 3.02_ ,
_Section 3.03_ , _Section 3.04_ and _Section 3.05_ of the Tronox Disclosure
Letter, which matters shall be disclosed only by specific disclosure in the
respective section of the Tronox Disclosure Letter).

by shares under the Corporations Act registered under the laws of the State of
Western Australia. Each Subsidiary of Tronox (the " _Tronox Subsidiaries_ ")

extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept) in all material respects.
Tronox and each Tronox Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority and

properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted
(the " _Tronox Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such power or
authority or to possess Tronox Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Tronox Material Adverse
Effect. Tronox and each Tronox Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Tronox Material Adverse Effect. Tronox has
delivered or made available to Cristal, prior to execution of this Agreement,

Constitution_ ") in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

and agrees that none of Cristal, its Affiliates and its Representatives has
made, is making or will make any representation or warranty, express or

projections or estimates of revenues, profits, cash flows or other financial
performance measures that have been or may in the future be made available to
Tronox or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with their

letter delivered by Cristal to Tronox at or before the execution and delivery
by Cristal of this Agreement (the " _Cristal Disclosure Letter_ "). The
Cristal Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article
IV_ , and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other
sections in this _Article IV_ to the extent (and only to the extent) that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other sections (other than _Section 4.02_ ,
_Section 4.03_ , _Section 4.04_ and _Section 4.05_ of the Cristal Disclosure
Letter, which matters shall be disclosed only by specific disclosure in the

material respects. Each of Cristal, the Seller and the Company has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it
to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct the
Business as presently conducted (the " _Business Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to possess Business Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each of Cristal, the
Seller and the Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Business Material Adverse Effect. Cristal has delivered or made available to
Tronox, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Cristal in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Cristal Certificate_ "), the amended and

assistance in so far as such comments relate to Cristal) to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Proxy Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any

document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments to such document or
response reasonably proposed by Cristal and (iii) shall promptly provide
Cristal with a copy of all such documents and communications filed with the

entitled to postpone or adjourn the Tronox General Meeting without the prior
written consent of Cristal, (A) to allow reasonable additional time for the

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, each of Tronox and Cristal shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such
other Party reasonable access during the period prior to the Closing to all
their respective properties, Tax-related materials, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each of Tronox and

other Party in connection with the preparation for the sale of the assets set
forth on _Section 6.02 of the Cristal Disclosure Letter_ ; provided that
either Party may withhold any document or information (i) that is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party (provided that the
withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) that is
subject to any attorney-client privilege (provided that the withholding Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
(or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege) or (iii) if providing such access or disclosing
such information would, in the reasonable opinion of disclosing Party, violate
applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws). If any material is
withheld by such Party pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, such
Party shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, during the
period prior to the earlier of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement and

50  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall either Tronox or any of its Affiliates, on the one

(i) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or
otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of Cristal,

Justice or other Governmental Entity), except, in the case of each of clauses
(i) through (v), as would not be detrimental to the Company and the
Transferred Companies, taken as a whole, or Tronox and the Tronox
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable; provided, however, that in the
event that any such remedy set forth in this _Section 6.03(c)_ is requested by
any Governmental Entity, the Party to which such request is made shall consult

each of Cristal and Tronox shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
agree to participate in any meeting or conference, whether in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance and, to

Party the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.
Each of Cristal and Tronox may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 6.03_ as "outside counsel only." Such competitively
sensitive material and the information contained therein shall be given only
to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from Cristal or Tronox, as
the case may be, or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to _Section 6.03(c)_ ,
in the event of a disagreement regarding the tactics or strategy for obtaining
any of the Regulatory Approvals, the final determination as to the appropriate
course of action shall be made by Tronox.

  

  

 

51  

  

(e) Tronox shall give prompt written notice to Cristal, and Cristal shall give
prompt written notice to Tronox, (i) of any substantive notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to
obtain such consent could be material to Cristal, Tronox, the Company or the
Transferred Companies, (ii) of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such Party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions, and (iii) if such Party becomes aware of any facts
or circumstances that such Party believes, or with the passage of time are
reasonably likely to, constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the
other Party.

  


 

  

Section 6.04 _Financing_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Cristal shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Transferred Companies to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Tronox and
its Affiliates, at Tronox's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested
by Tronox that is customary or necessary in connection with obtaining
financing in connection with the Transactions (so long as such cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Cristal and its
Subsidiaries), including, upon the reasonable request of Tronox, (i) assisting
Tronox with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials relating to
the Business reasonably required in connection with the syndication of the
financing, including, any confidential information memoranda, marketing
materials, offering documents, lender presentations, materials for rating
agency presentations and similar documents reasonably required in connection
with the debt financing obtained in connection with the Transaction (the "
_Debt Financing_ "); (ii) causing members of senior management of the Business
to participate with reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times in the
marketing activities undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Debt
Financing and in a reasonable number of presentations, due diligence sessions,

such financing; (iii) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, one or more credit agreements, guarantees, pledge and security
documents, indentures, supplemental indentures, currency or interest rate
hedging agreements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates (including solvency certificates), documents, or closing
deliverables with respect to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested
by Tronox or otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral,
provided that no such documents shall be effective until the Closing Date;
(iv) furnishing to Tronox and its financing sources, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, such financial information regarding Cristal, the Company and the
Transferred Companies as may be reasonably requested by Tronox; (v) assisting
with the establishment of bank accounts; (vi) within the time period required
by the commitment letter providing for the Debt Financing (when obtained),
providing all documentation and other information required by regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act; (vii)
providing to Tronox a copy of the resolutions of the board of directors of
Cristal approving this Agreement and the Transactions; and (viii) requesting
that its independent auditors cooperate with the Debt Financing and using
reasonable best efforts to cause such independent auditors to provide
customary "comfort" letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) in
relation to the Business in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 6.04_ , until the Closing occurs, neither
Cristal nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of their respective
Representatives, shall (A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee, (B) enter into any definitive agreement or have any liability or any
obligation under any certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or
any related document or any other agreement or document related to the
financing in connection with the Transactions, in each case that is not
contingent upon the Closing, (C) be required to incur any expenses in
connection with such financing or (D) be required to take any action in his or
her capacity as a director of Cristal or any of its Affiliates with respect to
such financing. Tronox shall promptly reimburse Cristal for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
by Cristal or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with their respective obligations pursuant to, and in accordance
with, this _Section 6.04_ , and shall indemnify and hold harmless Cristal, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred prior to
the Closing Date by any of them in connection with the arrangement of Tronox's
financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than
information provided by Cristal or any of its Affiliates) and all other
actions taken by Cristal, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.04_. Cristal hereby consents to the use of its,
the Company\'s and the Transferred Companies' respective logos in connection
with such financing; provided that such logos are used solely as a means to
identify Cristal, the Company and the Transferred Companies and in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Cristal, any
of its Affiliates, the Company or the Transferred Companies or their
reputation, goodwill or Marks or any of their other Intellectual Property
Rights.

Agreements_ "), a counterpart agreement to the Tronox TL Agreement, along with
supplements to the pledge and security agreements related thereto, and (v) a
joinder agreement to the intercreditor agreement relating to the Tronox Loan
Agreements, in each case, effective as of the Closing and at Tronox\'s sole
expense, and deliver any required certificates, legal opinions and other

(c) Tronox will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause its
Subsidiaries to obtain, (x) a commitment letter providing for the Debt
Financing sufficient, together with all available cash and other proceeds, to
fund the Cash Consideration at the Closing and (y) the Debt Financing
sufficient, together with all available cash and other proceeds, to fund the
Cash Consideration at the Closing. Upon the reasonable request of Cristal,
Tronox will provide Cristal with updates in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (including providing Cristal with
copies of any commitment letter providing for the Debt Financing, if and when
obtained). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tronox will give
Cristal prompt notice (i) of any material breach or default by any party to
any of the commitment letter providing for the Debt Financing (if and when
obtained) or definitive financing documents related to the Debt Financing of
which Tronox obtains Knowledge, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication, in each case from any financing sources (that are
or may become parties to the Debt Financing) with respect to (A) any material
actual or potential breach or default, or any termination or repudiation by
any party to the commitment letter providing for the Debt Financing (if and
when obtained) or definitive financing documents related to the Debt Financing
or (B) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to
the commitment letter providing for the Debt Financing (if and when obtained)
or definitive financing documents related to the Debt Financing with respect
to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded at Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason
Tronox in good faith determines that it will not be able to obtain all or any
material portion of the Debt Financing. Promptly after Cristal delivers to
Tronox a written request, Tronox will provide any information reasonably
requested by Cristal related to any circumstances referred to in clauses
(i)-(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that
Tronox need not provide any information which, after consultation with its
legal counsel, it has determined to be privileged or subject to
confidentiality restrictions.

  


 

  

Section 6.05 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not such Transactions are consummated.

  

  

 

54  

  

Section 6.06 _[Intentionally Omitted_ _.]_

  


 

  

Section 6.07 _Section_ _16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Cristal and Tronox
each shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of
Tronox Ordinary Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Tronox

become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Tronox to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Tronox and Cristal shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such Party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law; court process; with any
employees of such Party or their representatives as required to implement the
Transactions or as is otherwise reasonably considered by such Party to be
appropriate to maintain good employee relations; or by obligations pursuant to
the listing rules of, or any listing agreement with, any applicable national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Cristal and
Tronox agree that the initial press release(s), whether joint or several, to

by the Parties prior to the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.09 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Tronox shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Consideration Shares to be issued in connection with the

subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

Section 6.10 _Post-Closing Transfer of Assets_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement (including the Restructuring)
shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense or otherwise
provide rights with respect to any Contract to which the Company or a
Transferred Company is a party or any right thereunder if an attempted
assignment, license or other provision, without the Consent of a third party,
would constitute a breach or other contravention of a Contract with such third
party or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Tronox or any of its
Affiliates relating to such Contract. If any such Consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such Consent as promptly thereafter as
practicable and the costs of obtaining any such Consent shall be borne one
half by Cristal and one half by Tronox; provided that, without Tronox's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Cristal shall not (x) agree to pay any such costs of obtaining any
such Consent or (y) grant to any third party any concession that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Tronox's operation
of the Business after the Closing. If the Parties are unable to obtain any
required Consent prior to the Closing, Cristal shall, for a period of 18
months following the Closing, solely to the extent any Contract inures to the
benefit or burden of the Business, use reasonable best efforts to (i) continue
to be bound thereby pending assignment to Tronox, (ii) at the direction and
expense of Tronox, pay, perform and discharge fully all of its obligations
thereunder after the Closing and prior to assignment to Tronox, (iii) without
further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Tronox promptly all
monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such Contract
and (iv) exercise or exploit its rights and options under such Contract, when
and as reasonably directed by Tronox. During the period between the Closing
Date and two years after the Closing Date, if and when any such Consent shall
be obtained or such Contract shall otherwise become assignable, licensable,
sublicenseable or able to be provided to Tronox, Cristal shall promptly
assign, license, sublicense or otherwise provide such Contract to Tronox,
without payment of further consideration, and Tronox shall, without the
payment of any further consideration therefor, assume such Contract.

parties of the Transferred Companies or the Business for goods or services
provided by the Business or otherwise are in respect of a Transferred Company
hereunder (including promptly forwarding invoices or similar documentation to

Section 6.12 _Use of Name_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Tronox agrees that (except as expressly set forth in this _Section 6.12_ )
after the Closing neither Tronox nor its Affiliates (including the Company and
the Transferred Companies) shall have any rights in and to the mark "Cristal"
or any Mark containing or comprising the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Cristal Marks_ "), and will not at any time after the Closing market,
promote, advertise or offer for sale any products, goods or services utilizing
any of the Cristal Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having any
affiliation with Cristal or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
any Transferred Company). Tronox agrees that if any of the Business Assets,
including any promotional materials or printed forms, bear a Cristal Mark,
Tronox shall, prior to distributing, selling or otherwise making use of such
Business Assets for the general public, remove, delete, cover or render
illegible the Cristal Mark as it may appear on such Business Assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of six months after the Closing
Date, Tronox may use any remaining inventory of materials, including business
cards, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials
and other similar materials that include one or more of the Cristal Marks to
the extent such materials were included in the Business Assets as of the
Closing. Tronox shall indemnify and hold harmless Cristal, its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives against all Losses asserted against
or imposed upon them as a consequence of the use of the Cristal Marks by
Tronox and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred
Companies) following the Closing.

  

  

 

56  

  

(b) Tronox shall, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, make
the initial filing required to be made with the applicable Governmental Entity
to cause the Company and each Transferred Company whose name includes the name
"Cristal" to change its name such that its name does not include the name
"Cristal".

  


 

  

(c) Cristal agrees that, after the Closing, neither Cristal nor its Affiliates
(other than the Company or any Transferred Company) shall (i) have any rights
in and to any Marks of any of the Company or the Transferred Companies, or any
Marks that are included in the IP Assets, in each case containing or
comprising any of the foregoing, but excluding the Cristal Marks
(collectively, the " _Transferred Company Marks_ "); or (ii) market, promote,
advertise or offer for sale any products, goods or services utilizing any of
the Transferred Company Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having any
affiliation with Tronox, the Company, the Transferred Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

Section 6.13 _Shared Contracts_. Tronox acknowledges that Cristal and/or
Seller is a party to certain Contracts that relate both to the Business and
one or more of Cristal's other businesses with the vendors, distributors,
licensors and customers listed on _Section 6.13_ of the Cristal Disclosure
Letter (each, a " _Shared Contract_ "). Prior to the Closing, Cristal will, at
Tronox's request, use reasonable best efforts (at Tronox's cost and expense)
to cause the Company or a Transferred Company to enter into a new Contract
with respect to each such Shared Contract (each, a " _Replacement Contract_ ")
on terms that have been approved in writing in advance by Tronox (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). From the
Closing Date, until the six month anniversary thereof, Tronox shall use
reasonable best efforts to enter into any Replacement Contract not previously
entered into prior to the Closing. If the Company or a Transferred Company is
unable to enter into any Replacement Contract prior to the Closing, until the
earlier of such time as such Replacement Contract is entered into and six
months following the Closing Date, Cristal will, at Tronox's request, if
practicable, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Tronox (at Tronox's
cost and expense) in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Tronox and
Cristal intended to provide Tronox with services under such Shared Contract
and for Tronox to assume the Liabilities related thereto. For the avoidance of
doubt, from and after six months following the Closing, Tronox shall have no
right to receive any claims, rights or benefits under any Shared Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.13_ , the
effectiveness of any such Replacement Contract or other arrangement or any
liability or obligation thereunder shall be contingent upon the consummation
of the Closing.

  


 

  

Section 6.14 _Intercompany Arrangements_ _._

  


 

  

(a) As of the Closing, all Business Contracts and transactions between Cristal
and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Companies) on
the one hand, and the Company and the Transferred Companies, on the other hand
(other than the Business Contracts or other transactions listed on _Section
6.14_ of the Cristal Disclosure Letter), will either be terminated or amended
to remove or replace the applicable Company or Transferred Company or
Affiliate of Cristal, as the case may be, as a party to such agreement, as
applicable, without further liability to Tronox and its Affiliates (including
the Company or any Transferred Company) with respect to periods following the
Closing.

  

  

 

57  

  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Cristal shall cause the Company and each

Section 6.15 _Credit Support_ _._

  


 

  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
Closing, except to the extent Tronox consents in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Cristal and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Companies) shall not
provide any Credit Support to the Business, except for (i) replacements of
Credit Support existing on the date of this Agreement or extensions of the
term thereof, (ii) Credit Support required to be provided under Law, (iii)

(b) No later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Cristal shall
provide Tronox with an updated _Section 4.25_ of the Cristal Disclosure Letter
that sets forth all of the Credit Support reasonably expected to be
outstanding as of the Closing Date. Cristal and its Affiliates shall keep in
effect and maintain all of the Credit Support as of the Closing Date until the
earlier of (i) the date the applicable Credit Support is released or replaced
by Tronox or (ii) the date that is the ninetieth (90th) day following the
Closing Date. Tronox shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, on or
before the Closing Date (to the extent Cristal so requests), and in any event
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the release or replacement
of each of the obligations of Cristal (or any Affiliate or shareholder
thereof, other than the Company or the Transferred Companies) to provide
Credit Support in respect of any liability of the Company and/or any
Transferred Company set forth on such updated _Section 4.25_ of the Cristal
Disclosure Letter. To the extent Tronox does not obtain any such release or
replacement, Tronox shall indemnify and hold harmless Cristal in respect of
any liability or expense incurred by Cristal (or any Affiliate or shareholder
thereof, other than the Company and the Transferred Companies) in respect of
any claim made in respect of any such liability or expense arising or incurred
after the Closing Date.

  


 

  

Section 6.16 _Release of Indemnity Obligations_. Tronox and Cristal shall
cooperate with each other with a view to entering into arrangements effective

Cristal and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred
Companies) in any guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or arrangements
entered into by Cristal or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Transferred Companies) in respect of the Business. If Tronox or its Affiliates
cannot enter into the arrangements referred to above, Cristal shall not
terminate any such guarantee, letter of comfort, indemnity or arrangement
without Tronox's prior written consent; provided that Tronox shall enter into
a separate guaranty with Cristal or its applicable Affiliate (other than the
Company and the Transferred Companies) to guarantee the performance of the
obligations of Cristal or such Affiliate (other than the Company and the
Transferred Companies), as applicable, under the Contract underlying such
guarantee, letter of comfort, indemnity or arrangement.

  

  

 

58  

  

Section 6.17 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Tronox or
Cristal, as applicable, is prosecuting, contesting or defending any
Proceeding, other investigation, charge, claim, or demand by a third party
(including any securities regulator) in connection with (a) the Transactions
(including in respect of any regulatory policy issued by a securities
regulator that is applicable to the Transactions), or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection
with or arising from the Transferred Assets, the Business, the Company or the
Transferred Companies, the other Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (including with respect to Tronox after the Closing, the
Company and the Transferred Companies) and its and their respective directors,
officers and employees to, cooperate with such first Party and its counsel in
such prosecution, contest or defenses, including making available its
personnel, and providing such testimony and access to its books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or
defense. In the event that any litigation related to this Agreement or the
Transactions is brought against Tronox, any Tronox Subsidiary and/or the
Tronox Board (or the board of directors of any of Tronox's Subsidiaries),
Tronox shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Cristal of any
such litigation, give Cristal the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense of any such litigation and keep Cristal reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. Tronox agrees that it shall not
compromise, offer to settle, agree to any settlement or come to any
arrangement regarding any such litigation without Cristal's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, consent shall be reasonably
withheld if such consent prejudices any of Cristal\'s rights under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement in any material respect. Cristal shall
notify Tronox promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) of the commencement
of any such litigation of which Cristal has received notice. If any securities
regulator applicable to Tronox seeks or institutes a Proceeding, enquiry,
investigation, charge, claim or demand referred to in the first sentence of
this _Section 6.17_ in connection with the Transactions (including in respect
of any regulatory policy issued by a securities regulatory that is applicable
to the Transactions), Tronox shall promptly reimburse Cristal for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees) and expenses incurred by Cristal or any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives in connection with such Proceeding, enquiry,
investigation, charge, claim or demand, except where the Proceeding, enquiry,
investigation, charge, claim or demand by such securities regulator pertains
to a breach of Law by Cristal, or any of its Affiliates or Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Tronox hereby
agrees, following the Closing, to (to the extent applicable) move for
substitution or take similar actions under applicable Law for Tronox or one of
its Affiliates to be substituted for Cristal in any and all Proceedings
exclusively related to the Business, and for Cristal to be released from any
and all such Proceedings effective as of the Closing. In the event of any
conflict between this _Section 6.17_ and _Article IX_ , then Article IX shall
govern.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Cristal shall reasonably cooperate with Tronox to
transfer any data related to the Business to databases of the Company, the
Transferred Companies or their designees. Prior to the Closing, Cristal shall
use reasonable best efforts to (i) file applications to duly record any prior
transfers of Intellectual Property Rights with any and all relevant
Governmental Entities around the world sufficient to evidence in the records

applicable Affiliate's sole and exclusive ownership (prior to transfer to
Tronox) of the Intellectual Property Rights identified on _Section 4.16_ of
the Cristal Disclosure Letter, (ii) assign or transfer or cause its Affiliates

Companies to assign or transfer to Cristal or any of its Affiliates (other

Companies and (B) includes, embodies or incorporates any Cristal Marks or is
not used primarily in the Business. All reasonable costs associated with
compliance with this _Section 6.18_ shall be borne one half by Cristal and one
half by Tronox. Prior to the Closing Date, Cristal shall deliver to Tronox a
list of any payment required to be made by the Company or a Transferred
Company with the applicable patent, trademark or copyright office within 60
days following the Closing Date to maintain or renew any Intellectual Property

59  

  

(b) Cristal, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to the
Company and the Transferred Companies and any Affiliates of the Company and
the Transferred Companies (including Persons that become an Affiliate of the
Company or a Transferred Company after the Closing Date) a perpetual, non-
exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free,
fully-paid up license to use any Intellectual Property Rights owned by Cristal
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or Transferred Company)
immediately prior to the Closing that are not included in the IP Assets or
owned by the Company or a Transferred Company and used or held for use in the
conduct of the Business immediately prior to the Closing, including such
Intellectual Property Rights assigned by the Company or a Transferred Company
pursuant to _Section 6.18(a)_ (other than Intellectual Property Rights that
include, embody or incorporate any Cristal Marks). Such license includes the
right to make, have made, use, sell, and import products and practice methods
covered by such Intellectual Property Rights and to reproduce, distribute,
perform, display, and prepare derivative works of, such Intellectual Property
Rights. Cristal represents and warrants that it has the authority to grant the
foregoing license on behalf of its Affiliates (other than the Company or the
Transferred Companies).

to Beneficially Own 4.9% or less of the applicable class of outstanding
Securities of such Person within twelve months after the date of such

more than $200,000,000 of the aggregate revenues of the Acquired Business in
such calendar year (measured using the Exchange Rate as of the last Business

Subsidiaries may consummate the acquisition of such Acquired Business,
provided further that Cristal or its applicable Subsidiaries shall enter into
a definitive agreement to divest such Acquired Competing Business within six
months following the date on which such Acquired Business was acquired. If the
divestiture of an Acquired Competing Business is required pursuant to this
_Section 6.19(a)(iii)_ , Cristal shall provide notice to Tronox, and Cristal
shall not, and shall not permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries to, enter
into any definitive agreement regarding such divestiture without first
commencing and conducting in good faith for not less than 20 Business Days
negotiations with Tronox regarding a potential acquisition by Tronox or its
Affiliates of such Acquired Competing Business.

  


 

  

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the second
anniversary thereof, Cristal shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly (including through representatives), solicit,
influence, entice or encourage any Transferred Employee to cease his or her
employment with Tronox or its Affiliates, as applicable, without the prior

Cristal.

  

  

 

61  

  

(d) _Section 6.19(b)_ and _Section 6.19(c)_ will not be deemed to prohibit the
Parties or their respective Affiliates from engaging in general media
advertising or general employment solicitation that may be targeted to a
particular geographic or technical area but that is not targeted towards
Transferred Employees or Cristal Employees, as applicable.

  


 

  

(e) The Parties acknowledge that (i) the restrictive provisions of this
_Section 6.19_ are material inducement for Tronox to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) Tronox would not enter into this Agreement without such
restrictive provisions and (iii) such restrictive provisions are reasonable
and necessary and that Tronox will be irrevocably damaged if such covenants
are not specifically enforced. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that,
in addition to any other relief or remedies available to Tronox, Tronox shall
be entitled to seek and obtain an appropriate injunction or other equitable
remedy from a Court for the purposes of restraining a Party from any actual or
threatened breach of such covenants, and no bond or security will be required
in connection therewith. It is the desire of the Parties that the restrictive
provisions of this _Section 6.19_ be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under any applicable Law and public policies applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If a Court declares that any term
or provision of _Section 6.19_ is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree
that the Court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability
shall have the power to (and the Parties shall request such Court to) reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or enforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closes to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and _Section 6.19_ shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  


 

  

(f) Cristal and Tronox shall take such actions that are necessary to cause the
non-solicit provisions contained in Section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement
to terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing.

information required by Tronox and its Affiliates (including the Company and

requirements and (ii) to submit any claims that would reasonably be expected
to be covered under the insurance policies of Tronox or its Affiliates or

avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, Cristal and its Affiliates shall
retain all rights to control its insurance policies and programs, including

deductible amount referred to in _Section 9.05 (b))_ and a maximum coverage
amount equal in aggregate to $231,000,000 (taking into account any exclusions
set forth in the RandW policy). Cristal and Seller agree to reasonably minimize
the retention amount under the RandW Policy to a customary level. Cristal and
Seller will bear the total cost of the RandW Policy. Tronox will take all steps

practicable following the date of this Agreement or at such time prior to

to the Closing, whether or not the Approval Resolutions have been passed:

  


 

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Cristal and Tronox;

  


 

  

(b) by either Cristal or Tronox:

  

  

 

72  

  

(i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before the date which is fifteen
(15) months after the date hereof (the " _End Date_ "); provided that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to any Party if such failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the End Date is primarily the result of the failure of the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  


 

  

(ii) if the condition set forth in _Section 7.01(f)_ is not satisfied and the
Legal Restraint giving rise to such non-satisfaction shall have become final
and non-appealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any Party if
the Legal Restraint's having become final and non-appealable was primarily due
to the failure of such Party to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(iii) if the Approval Resolutions are not passed at the Tronox General
Meeting;

  


 

  

(c) by Cristal, if Tronox breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or
warranties of Tronox contained herein fails to be true and correct, which
breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.02(b)_ or _7.02(c)_ and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being
cured by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured (A) within 30 days following receipt of written notice from Cristal
of such breach or failure or (B) any shorter period of time that remains
between the date Cristal provides written notice of such breach or failure and
the End Date; provided that Cristal shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ if it is then in material breach
of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and any
representation or warranty of Cristal contained herein then fails to be true
and correct, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(b)_ or
_7.03(d)_ would not then be satisfied; or

  


 

  

(d) by Tronox, if Cristal breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or
warranties of Cristal contained herein fails to be true and correct, which
breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.03(b)_ or _7.03(c)_ and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being
cured by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured (A) within 30 days following receipt of written notice from Tronox
of such breach or failure or (B) any shorter period of time that remains
between the date Tronox provides written notice of such breach or failure and
the End Date; provided that Tronox shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)_ if it is then in material breach
of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and no
representation or warranty of Tronox contained herein then fails to be true
and correct, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_ or
_7.02(c)_ would not then be satisfied.

  


 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.01_ ,
this Agreement may not be terminated by any Party unless any fee required to
be paid (or caused to be paid), if any, by such Party pursuant to _Section
8.02_ at or prior to the time of such termination shall have been paid in
full.

  

  

 

73  

  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_ _._

  


 

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Tronox or Cristal
as provided in _Section 8.01_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Cristal or
Tronox, other than this _Section 8.02_ , the last sentence of _Section 6.02_ ,
_Section 6.05_ and _Article XII_ , which provisions (and the Confidentiality
Agreement) shall survive such termination; provided that, no such termination
shall relieve any Party from any liability or damages incurred or suffered by
a Party to the extent such liabilities or damages were the result of fraud or
the willful and material breach by another Party of any of its covenants or
other agreements set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful and material breach" shall mean a deliberate act or a deliberate
failure to act, which act or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a
material breach of this Agreement, regardless of whether breaching was the
conscious object of the act or failure to act.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Cristal or Tronox
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ and on the date of such termination all of
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.01_ , _Section 7.02_ and
_Section 7.03_ shall have been satisfied or waived, other than (x) the
condition set forth in _Section 7.01(d)_ (relating to financing), and (y)
those conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the Closing (but,
in the case of clause (y), which conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), then Tronox
shall promptly, but in no event later than three Business Days after the date
of such termination, pay to Cristal a nonrefundable fee equal to $100,000,000
(the " _Tronox Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Cristal to Tronox for such
purpose (it being understood that in no event shall Tronox be required to pay
the Tronox Termination Fee on more than one occasion); provided that Cristal
shall not be entitled to receive the Tronox Termination Fee if Cristal is then
in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Cristal or Tronox pursuant to
(i) _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ and on the date of such termination the condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_ has not been satisfied or (ii) _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_ (relating to failure to pass the Approval Resolutions at the
Tronox General Meeting), then Tronox shall reimburse Cristal for any
reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket fees or expenses incurred or paid by
or on behalf of Cristal or any of its shareholders or its or their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, all
related agreements and documents, the due diligence investigation conducted by
or with respect to Tronox and the Tronox Subsidiaries and the transactions
contemplated hereby by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Cristal to Tronox for such purpose within
three Business Days after the date of Tronox's receipt of such documentation
and account designation; provided, that in no event shall the amount of such
fees and expenses reimbursed by Tronox to Cristal exceed $15,000,000 in the
aggregate.

  


 

  

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Tronox fails to pay any amount pursuant to this
_Section 8.02_ when due and, in order to obtain such payment, Cristal
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Tronox for any amounts due
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ , Tronox shall pay to the other Party its out-
of-pocket, documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) in connection with the collection of such overdue amount
and the enforcement by Cristal of its rights under this _Section 8.02_ and
Tronox will pay to Cristal interest on such overdue amount (for the period
commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be
paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Cristal in
full) at a rate per annum of the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of
America, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid.

  

  

 

74  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Tronox Termination Fee is payable and Tronox pays the Tronox
Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 8.02_ , such
payment, and any costs or expenses payable to Cristal pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 6.04_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, except
as provided in _Section 8.02(a)_ , of Cristal and its Affiliates against
Tronox, its Affiliates and any of their respective former, current, or future
shareholders, equityholders, partners, directors, officers, members, managers,
Affiliates or agents for any losses or damages suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Tronox
in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered in
connection herewith or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and
upon payment of such amount if and when due, none of Tronox, its Affiliates or
any of their respective former, current, or future stockholders,
equityholders, partners, directors, officers, members, managers, Affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  


 

  

Section 8.03 _Procedure for Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Cristal or Tronox, or both, pursuant to _Section 8.01_ ,
written notice thereof specifying the relevant provision under which
termination is made shall be given to the other Party and the basis therefor
described in reasonable detail, and the Transactions shall be abandoned,
without further action by any Party. A termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
Cristal or Tronox, action by its respective board of directors or the duly
authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Closing shall not require the approval of the shareholders of Cristal or
members of Tronox.

in their respective capacities as such, and the heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and permitted assigns of the foregoing Persons
(collectively the " _Tronox Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all

without duplication, any Taxes of the Company or the Transferred Companies as
a result of successor or transferee liability or other secondary or non-
primary liability for Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or the
Transferred Companies pursuant to any Law (including Section 1.1502-6 of the
U.S. Treasury Regulations or any similar provision of U.S. state or local or
non-U.S. Tax Law), or by contract or otherwise (other than a contract entered
into in the ordinary course of business, the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes), where such liability is imposed on the Company or the
Transferred Companies as a result of an act, transaction or agreement
occurring or entered into prior to the Closing, (f) any Taxes of Cristal, the
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (excluding, for avoidance of
doubt, the Company and the Transferred Companies) that any Tronox Indemnitee
is liable for jointly or severally, as a successor or transferee, or otherwise
or (g) the matter described in item 1 of _Section 4.11_ of the Cristal
Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
determination of whether any breach of any representation or warranty (other
than the representations and warranties in _Section 4.06(b)_ , _Section
4.06(d)_ or the first sentence of Section 4.08, or with respect to the
standard that must be met to create an obligation to include items in a list
set forth in the Cristal Disclosure Letter) has occurred and of the amount of
Losses arising out of or resulting from any such breach shall be made without
regard to any qualification or exception contained in such representation or
warranty relating to materiality or Business Material Adverse Effect.

Section 9.02 _Indemnification by Tronox_. From and after the Closing, subject
to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Tronox shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cristal and its
Affiliates, the past, present and future directors, officers, employees and
agents of Cristal, its shareholders and its and their respective Affiliates,
in their respective capacities as such, and the heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and permitted assigns of the foregoing Persons
(collectively the " _Cristal Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses which any Cristal Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent such
Losses arise out of or result from: (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Tronox contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
hereunder (other than the Tronox Fundamental Representations) as of the
Closing (or, in the case of any such representation or warranty specifically
made as of another date, as of such other date), (b) any breach of any Tronox
Fundamental Representation as of the Closing (or, in the case of any such
representation or warranty specifically made as of another date, as of such
other date), and (c) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be performed by Tronox, in whole or in part, after the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of
clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the determination
of whether any breach of any representation or warranty (other than with
respect to the standard that must be met to create an obligation to include
items in a list set forth in the Tronox Disclosure Letter) has occurred and of
the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting from any such breach shall be
made without regard to any qualification or exception contained in such
representation or warranty relating to materiality or Tronox Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

 

76  

  

Section 9.03 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  


 

  

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

  


 

  

(i) Any Tronox Indemnitee or Cristal Indemnitee seeking indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under _Section 9.01_
or _Section 9.02_ , as applicable, shall promptly deliver to the other Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written notice (a " _Third Party Claim
Notice_ ") setting forth a description in reasonable detail of the nature of
the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third
Party Claim (if any), the basis for the Indemnified Party's request for
indemnification under this Agreement and a reasonable estimate (if calculable)
of any Losses suffered with respect to such Third Party Claim; provided that
the failure to so transmit a Third Party Claim Notice shall not affect the
Indemnifying Party's obligations under this _Article IX_ , except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure.

  


 

  

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is asserted against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and to settle such Third Party Claim at the discretion of
the Indemnifying Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
if (A) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal claim involving the Indemnified Party as a defendant, (B) the
gravamen of the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against any Indemnified Party, (C) the Third Party Claim seeks has or would
reasonably be expected to result in Losses in excess of the amounts available
for indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ or (D) the Third Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
of Cristal or Tronox, as applicable, taken as a whole. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into
any settlement or consent to entry of any judgment that (1) does not include
the provision by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties
of a full, unconditional and irrevocable release from all Liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim, (2) includes an admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party or (3)
includes injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting any Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
legal fees or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party (it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense);
provided further that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses
of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable opinion of legal counsel
to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, a
conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party which makes representation of both parties
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct; provided
further that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than
one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified
Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party may
retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement of any Third
Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying Party has elected to control
if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under this
_Article IX_ and fully releases the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

  

  

 

77  

  

(iii) All of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
each Party (or a duly authorized representative of such Party) shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) furnish such records, information and testimony
that are within its possession or under its control and reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

  


 

  

(b) _Direct Claims_. If any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ that does not involve a Third Party
Claim being asserted against such Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice (a " _Direct Claim Notice_ ") setting forth a description in
reasonable detail of the nature of the Direct Claim, copies of all material
written evidence thereof, the basis for the Indemnified Party's request for
indemnification under this Agreement and a reasonable estimate (if calculable)
of any Losses suffered with respect to such Direct Claim; provided that the
failure to so transmit a Direct Claim Notice shall not affect the Indemnifying
Party's obligations under this _Article IX_ , except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party\'s investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including reasonable access to Cristal
and its Affiliates or Tronox and its Affiliates\' (as applicable) premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records
reasonably relevant to the Direct Claim) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its advisors may reasonably request; _provided_ , that any such access shall
be conducted at the Indemnifying Party's expense, during normal business hours
under the reasonable supervision of the Indemnified Party's agents and in such
a manner as not to interfere in any material respect with the normal
operations of the Indemnified Party; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall treat all such information as confidential and hereby
waives any right to use such information for any purpose other than in
connection with a Direct Claim or its investigation. If the Indemnifying Party
disputes a Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall attempt to resolve in good faith such dispute within 45 days of the
Indemnifying Party delivering written notice to the Indemnified Party of such
dispute. If such dispute is not so resolved within such 45-day period, then
either party may initiate a Proceeding with respect to the subject matter of
such dispute in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, _Article
XII_.

  

  

 

78  

  

Section 9.04 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the
Cristal Fundamental Representations and the Tronox Fundamental Representations
shall survive the Closing until the date that is six years after the Closing
Date, (b) all other representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the date that is 18 months after the Closing
Date and (c) except as otherwise specified herein, all covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed, in whole or in part,
after the Closing shall survive the Closing indefinitely; provided that each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement
shall survive the time at which it would otherwise expire pursuant to this
_Section 9.04_ if, prior to such time, notice of a breach or potential breach
thereof giving rise to a right or potential right of indemnity under this
_Article IX_ shall have been given to the Party against whom such indemnity
may be sought in accordance with _Section 9.03_. Any claim not asserted in
accordance with this _Article IX_ on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 9.04_ will be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

(j) (i) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect
any available third party insurance proceeds, including any proceeds from the

Loss for which an Indemnified Party may make a claim shall be reduced by any
Insurance Proceeds actually collected by such Indemnified Party in respect of

been due if such Insurance Proceeds had been collected before such indemnity
payment was made, (iv) all Losses shall be net of any Tax Benefit actually

_Section 9.01(a)_ to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Tronox
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses which any Tronox Indemnitee
may incur or suffer to the extent such Losses arise out of or result from any
breach of any representation or warranty of Cristal contained in _Section
4.13_ to the extent that such Losses result from, or with respect to clause
(ii) below only, would not have arisen but for, or are increased by any of the
following:

provided voluntary sampling must be limited in scope to evaluate the specific
allegation in the claim; or

  


 

  

(ii) any cessation, closing, abandoning, decommissioning or terminating of
current mining or manufacturing activities at any property owned or leased for
the Business after Closing, or change in the use of such property to non-
industrial purposes after the Closing (but this clause (ii) shall not apply to
transfers to third-parties, provided such transfers will not result in a
change of use to a non-industrial purpose); or

  


 

  

(iii) any act or omission by a Relevant Tronox Person that is (A) reckless or
negligent, (B) not in the ordinary course of business of the Business as
carried out prior to Closing or (C) results in any exacerbation or worsening
of any pre-Closing condition; or

81  

  

Section 9.06 _Currency Conversion_. If the amount of any Losses incurred or

Section 9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in cases of common law fraud, from and

and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of action (including rights
of contributions, if any), whether in contract, tort or otherwise, known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law, that any Party
may have against the other Party in respect of any breach of this Agreement;
provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to deny (a) any Party
equitable remedies (including injunctive relief or specific performance) when
any such remedy is otherwise available under this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 12.12_ , or (b) any Party or its Affiliates any remedies under any
Ancillary Agreement, and the foregoing shall not interfere with or impede the

and the Seller and should be allocated to the transferred asset to which it
relates, unless otherwise required by Law (including by a determination of a
Tax authority that, under applicable Law, is not subject to further review or
appeal).

  


 

  

Section 9.09 _Payments; Sale Notice_. Any indemnification of the Tronox
Indemnitees pursuant to this Article IX shall be paid (i) first, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article IX and solely with respect to claims
which would be covered by the RandW Policy but for the retention amount under
such RandW Policy, by Cristal or the Seller up to the amount of the retention
amount under the RandW Policy, (ii) second from the RandW Policy to the extent
coverage is available to such Tronox Indemnitee under such RandW Policy, and
(iii) third, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX and
solely with respect to claims that are not covered by the RandW Policy
(including as the result of any exclusion), by Cristal or the Seller. If
Cristal or the Seller fails to make any payment due by it to a Tronox
Indemnitee under (i) or (iii) above within 10 Business Days of the final
resolution of an indemnification claim that is brought prior to the Security
Date in accordance with this Article IX, Tronox shall be entitled to issue a
notice to Cristal or the Seller (a "Sale Notice") requiring the Seller to, or
Cristal to cause the Seller to, transfer to Tronox a number of Consideration
Shares having an aggregate value equal to the unpaid amount calculated by
reference to the average market price per Tronox A Ordinary share over the 30
days immediately preceding the date on which the Sale Notice was issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tronox receives payment of the unpaid amount
from Cristal or any Cristal Affiliate within 10 Business Days of receiving a
Sale Notice, the Sale Notice shall be deemed to have been irrevocably
withdrawn by Tronox and shall be of no further effect. For the purposes of
this Section 9.09, "Security Date" means the later of (x) the date that is 18
months after the Closing Date (the "Termination Date") and (y) the date on
which all claims for indemnification under Section 9.01(a) asserted in writing
by a Tronox Indemnitee prior to the Termination Date have been finally
resolved.

ARTICLE X

  

  

 _Tax Matters_

  


 

  

Section 10.01 _Allocation_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, Tronox shall provide Cristal with a draft allocation of the
Consideration among the Acquired Shares, the Transferred Companies, the
Transferred Assets (in the aggregate), and the Yanbu Securities, determined
based on Tronox\'s good-faith determination of the fair market value of such
assets (the " _Draft Allocation_ "); _provided_ , that, to the fullest extent
possible, the Consideration Shares shall be reflected as paid in respect of
the BV Shares in the Draft Allocation. Within forty-five (45) calendar days
after receipt of the Draft Allocation, Cristal shall notify Tronox of any
disagreement with such allocation, together with reasonable written supporting
documentation describing Cristal's position. Tronox and Cristal shall
negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve any disagreement with respect
to the Draft Allocation, _provided_ that if such negotiations do not result in
an agreement within thirty (30) calendar days after Tronox's receipt of the
disagreement notice from Cristal, then the matter shall be submitted for
resolution and determination to the Independent Accountant in accordance with
the principles set forth in _Section 1.08(f)_ , which determination shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties (the allocation, as finally
agreed to by the Parties or determined by the Independent Accountant, the "
_Allocation_ "). In the event the Parties agree on a structure under _Section
1.09_ or _Section 10.09_ that involves a transfer by Cristal of interests in
any of the Transferred Companies at the Closing to Tronox or its Affiliates,
the Parties acting reasonably shall reflect in the Allocation an allocation of
appropriate portions of Consideration (including the amounts thereof
consisting of Cash Consideration and Consideration Shares) to such interests.
Any adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.08_ shall be
allocated to the Acquired Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent the Allocation provides that any of the Consideration
Shares are to be paid to Cristal in respect of the Transferred Assets, the
shares of CAP (if sold by Cristal to Tronox or its Affiliates pursuant to
_Section 1.01(y)_ ), or the Yanbu Securities (or interests referenced in the
second preceding sentence), the Parties agree that such Consideration Shares
shall be directed to the Seller and shall not be issued to Cristal.

  


 

  

(b) Tronox and its Affiliates will reflect the transactions set forth in
_Article I_ in their Business Financial Statements in a manner that is
consistent with U.S. GAAP.

  


 

  

Section 10.02 _Transfer Taxes and VAT_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Tronox and Cristal will each pay fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer
Taxes, and any Transfer Taxes due on the Closing Date and all related interest
and penalties on the Closing Date; provided, however, that each Party will
use, and will cause each of its Affiliates to use, reasonable efforts to avail
itself of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to
cooperate with the other Party in providing any information and documentation
that may be necessary to obtain such exemption.

  

  

 

83  

  

(b) Each of Cristal, Tronox and its respective Subsidiaries will cooperate in
timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in
connection with Tronox's payment of Transfer Taxes. Cristal and Tronox, as
appropriate, will execute and deliver, and each of Tronox and Cristal will
cause each of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, to execute and deliver, all
instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to enable the other party to
comply with any filing requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

(c) All sums (or other consideration) set out in this Agreement or otherwise
payable (or provided) by any Party to any other Party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT.

  


 

  

(d) Where, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any Party (the "
_Supplier_ ") makes a supply to any other Party (the " _Recipient_ ") for VAT
purposes and VAT is or becomes chargeable on such supply for which the
Supplier is required to account to the relevant Governmental Entity, the
Recipient shall, subject to the receipt of a valid VAT invoice (if required by
applicable law), pay to the Supplier (in addition to and at the same time as
any other consideration for such supply) a sum equal to the amount of such
VAT.

  


 

  

(e) Where any Party is required by the terms of this Agreement to reimburse or
indemnify any other Party for any cost or expense, such first Party shall
reimburse or indemnify such other Party for the full amount of such cost or
expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent
that such other Party is entitled to recover (by way of credit, repayment or
otherwise) such VAT from the relevant Governmental Entity.

  


 

  

Section 10.03 _Filing of Tax Returns_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Cristal shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause
to be filed, at its own expense (i) all Tax Returns of, or with respect to the
assets of, the Company and the Transferred Companies, and (ii) all Tax Returns
with respect to the Transferred Assets, in each case, with a due date (taking
into account applicable extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a "
_Cristal Tax Return_ "); provided that each Cristal Tax Return shall be
prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Company, the Transferred
Companies or the owner of the Transferred Assets, as applicable, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Cristal shall (or shall cause its
Affiliates to) timely remit all Taxes shown thereon as due.

  


 

  

(b) Cristal shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, at its own expense (i) all
Tax Returns of, or with respect to the assets of, the Company and the
Transferred Companies, and (ii) all Tax Returns with respect to the
Transferred Assets, in each case, with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
other than Cristal Tax Returns, with a due date (taking into account
applicable extensions) after the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Return_ "); provided, that: (i) each Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be prepared
in accordance with the past practice of the Company and the Transferred
Companies, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, (ii) Cristal shall
provide Tronox with a draft of each Pre-Closing Tax Return at least thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the due date (taking into account applicable
extensions) for such Tax Return, (iii) Tronox shall have the right to review
and comment on any Pre-Closing Tax Return, and (iv) to the extent Tronox
provides any reasonable comments at least ten calendar days prior to the due
date for any Pre-Closing Tax Return, Cristal shall make such modifications as
are requested by Tronox on such Tax Returns. Cristal shall timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, such Pre-Closing Tax Returns and, to the extent that
Cristal would be liable in respect of such Taxes under _Section 9.01_ , remit,
or cause to be remitted, payment for any Taxes shown as due on such Pre-

other Tax Returns of the Company, the Transferred Companies and the

case of non-income Tax Returns, as soon as reasonably possible) prior to the
due date (taking into account applicable extensions) for such Tax Return,
(iii) Cristal shall have the right to review such Tax Return, and (iv) to the
extent Cristal provides any reasonable comments at least ten (10) calendar
days prior to the due date for any such income Tax Return (and promptly after

Section 10.04 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it
is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company, the
Transferred Companies or the Transferred Assets for any Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit for the Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two taxable
years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books
of the Company and the Transferred Companies were closed at the close of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes (other than income, franchise/capital,
sales, use, or withholding Taxes) such as real and personal property taxes,
shall be apportioned ratably between such periods based on the number of days
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date, on the other hand.

(including the Company or any Transferred Company) which involves the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any audit, suit, action or
proceeding involving Taxes (collectively, a " _Tax Claim_ ") in respect of
which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, or that otherwise
could increase the liability of Cristal or any of its Affiliates for Taxes;
provided, however, that no failure or delay by Tronox to provide notice of a
Tax Claim shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of Cristal or any of
its Affiliates hereunder, except to the extent that Cristal or its Affiliate
is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

  


 

  

(b) Cristal at its own expense shall have the right to represent the interests
of itself, the Company and the Transferred Companies in any and all Tax Claims
relating to (x)Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company or any Transferred Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (y) any Tax Return of or Taxes of Cristal
and/or its Affiliates, (z) any Tax Return or Taxes imposed on or with respect
to the Business or any Transferred Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
provided, however, that (i) Tronox shall have the right at its own expense,
directly or through its designated representatives, to participate fully in
such Tax Proceeding, including to review in advance and reasonably comment
upon submissions of briefs or similar documents made in the course of such Tax
Proceeding and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, (ii) Cristal
shall defend or prosecute such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (iii)
Cristal shall keep Tronox advised of any significant developments and events
relating to such Tax Claim and (iv) Tronox's consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any settlement by
Cristal that would result in liability of Tronox or its Affiliates for Taxes
for which they are not entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.01_.

  


 

  

(c) Tronox at its own expense shall have the right to represent the interests
of the Company and the Transferred Companies in any and all Tax Claims, other
than Tax Claims described in _Section 10.05(b)_ ; provided, that, in the case
of any Tax Claim relating to (x)Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company or any
Transferred Company for any Straddle Period or (y) any Tax Return or Taxes
imposed on or with respect to the Business or any Transferred Assets for any
Straddle Period, (i) Cristal shall have the right at its own expense, directly
or through its designated representatives, to participate fully in such Tax
Proceeding, including to review in advance and reasonably comment upon
submissions of briefs or similar documents made in the course of such Tax
Proceeding and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, (ii) Tronox

fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns of the Company or the Transferred

respective legal and tax advisors (it being understood such information may be

86

as a current asset in Closing Working Capital on the final Closing Statement,
Cristal shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes
for which Cristal is responsible pursuant to _Article IX_. Upon the reasonable
request of Cristal and at Cristal's expense, Tronox agrees to file or cause to

Taxes directly or indirectly imposed on the receipt or accrual of such refund
(including any withholding Taxes directly or indirectly incurred in connection
with the payment of such amount by Tronox or Cristal)). No amounts shall be
payable by Tronox or its Affiliates under this _Section 10.07_ to the extent
(A) the receipt of such refund obligates the Company or any Transferred
Company to make a payment to a third party pursuant to a contract entered into
on or prior to the Closing Date or under applicable Law; or (B) the refund is
with respect to a Tax that Cristal did not pay prior to the Closing Date or
include in the calculation of Closing Working Capital or indemnify for
pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 10.08 _Tronox Pre-Closing Reorganization_. In connection with or
reasonably promptly following the execution of this Agreement (and in any
event prior to the Closing), Tronox will satisfy (or will have satisfied) the
requirements of _Exhibit I_.

  


 

  

Section 10.09 _Cristal Metals Inc._. For avoidance of doubt, no representation
is made in _Section 4.09_ as of the date hereof as to whether the stock of
Cristal Metals Inc. is or has been a USRPI during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Reasonably promptly
following the date of this Agreement (and in any event prior to the Closing),
Cristal will determine whether the stock of Cristal Metals Inc. is or has been
a USRPI during such applicable period. To the extent Cristal determines the
stock of Cristal Metals Inc. is not and has not been a USRPI during such
applicable period, Cristal shall make the representation set forth in _Section
4.09(e)_ of this Agreement with respect to Cristal Metals Inc. as of the
Closing Date and shall provide the certificate described in _Section
1.07(a)(vi)_ of this Agreement with respect to Cristal Metals Inc. To the
extent Cristal determines the stock of Cristal Metals Inc. is or has been a
USRPI during such applicable period, Cristal shall seek a certificate from the
IRS pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-3 to the effect that a
transfer of the shares of Cristal Metals Inc. is exempt from withholding;
provided, that to the extent Cristal is unable to obtain such a certificate
prior to Closing, the transfer of the shares of Cristal Metals Inc. in
connection with the Restructuring shall be subject to withholding in
accordance with Section 1445 of the Code and Cristal shall prior to Closing
provide evidence to Tronox that (x) the appropriate amount has been withheld
and set aside by the Company for timely payment of the applicable Taxes (if
any) following an IRS determination, in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-1(c)(2) or (y) the appropriate Taxes were withheld and remitted
to the applicable taxing authority. To the extent that, as of the time of
Closing, an amount has been withheld and set aside pursuant to clause (x) of
the preceding sentence, (i) Tronox will procure that the appropriate Taxes (if
any) are remitted by the Company to the applicable taxing authority promptly
following the applicable IRS determination and, to the extent the amount of
such Taxes does not exceed the amount that has been withheld and set aside as
of the time of the Closing, no indemnification shall be required in respect of
such Taxes under _Section 9.01_ , (ii) to the extent the amount that has been
withheld and set aside exceeds the amount of Tax (if any) the Company is
required to pay pursuant to the applicable IRS determination, Tronox shall
promptly refund such excess to Cristal, and (iii) such amount and the
withholding Tax liability such amount was set aside to address shall not be
reflected in the calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount or the Actual
Adjustment Amount. If Cristal does not make the representation in _Section
4.09(e)_ of this Agreement or provide the certificate described in _Section
1.07(a)(vi)_ with respect to Cristal Metals Inc. and Tronox determines that a
post-closing transfer of Cristal Metals Inc. could be subject to withholding
under Section 1445 of the Code, Tronox and Cristal shall work in good faith to
determine whether to cause the shares of Cristal Metals Inc. to be sold
directly to a US subsidiary of Tronox (either subject to no withholding under
Section 1445 of the Code, if a certificate under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-3 is obtained from the IRS and provided to Tronox prior to Closing, or
subject to applicable withholding under Section 1445 of the Code), it being
understood Cristal and its Affiliates shall not be required to make such a
sale if doing so would reasonably be expected to result in material Taxes
(other than the withholding under Section 1445 of the Code just described) for
the Cristal Indemnitees, against which they are not indemnified by Tronox to
Cristal\'s reasonable satisfaction.

months and (y) (with respect to other compensation and employee benefits) 12
months immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Tronox shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries (including the
Company and the Transferred Companies), to provide each employee of each of
the Company and Transferred Companies (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity or equity-based
compensation) that are equal to the greater of (i) compensation and employee
benefits (other than equity or equity-based compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to compensation and employee
benefits to which the Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to
the Closing and (ii) compensation and employee benefits (other than equity or
equity-based compensation) that are at the same level as applies to similarly
situated individuals employed by Tronox or any Tronox Subsidiaries, provided,
that notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.01(a)_ to the contrary,
Tronox shall provide or shall cause to be provided each Continuing Employee
covered by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with compensation,
benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment in compliance with the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, as may be modified
from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, Tronox shall, or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries (including the Company and the Transferred
Companies) to use reasonable best efforts to take the following actions with
respect to each Continuing Employee under any employee benefit plans of Tronox
or any of its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee may become eligible
to participate after the Closing (each a " _Purchaser Plan_ ", and
collectively, the " _Purchaser Plans_ "): (i) to the extent required by law,
waive any limitations regarding pre-existing conditions, evidence of
insurability requirements and eligibility waiting periods to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Business Benefit
Plans in which a Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing; (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any such Purchaser Plans; and (iii) for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under all Purchaser Plans applicable to a Continuing
Employee, treat all service by such Continuing Employee with Cristal and its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or with the Company or any
Transferred Company before the Closing as service with Tronox and its
Subsidiaries and its or their Affiliates to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such
service under any similar Business Benefit Plan; provided that no such service
shall be credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  

  

 

88  

  

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Tronox or any
Tronox Subsidiaries to continue any specific benefit plans or to continue the
employment, or any changes to the terms and conditions of the employment, of
any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Tronox or Cristal or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to (i) amend, modify or terminate any plans,
programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Tronox or
Cristal or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee or other individual for any reason or at
any time, including without cause. Without limiting the scope of _Section
12.06_ , nothing in this _Section 11.01_ shall confer any rights or remedies
of any kind or description upon any Transferred Employee or any other person
other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

(c) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
constitute an amendment to any Tronox Business Benefit Plan or Business
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefits plan maintained for or
provided to employees, directors or consultants of Tronox or Cristal or any of
their respective Subsidiaries prior to or following the Closing.

  


 

  

(d) In no event shall Tronox be obligated to replicate, replace or cash out
any equity awards of Cristal held by any Continuing Employee.

  


 

  

(e) In furtherance of the integration activities relating to the acquisition
by Tronox of the Business hereunder, there shall be appropriate integration
committees, including a committee to address prior to the Closing the
consideration and determination of certain employee-related matters, and any
such committees shall include representatives designated by Cristal.

Parties any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

 

103  

  

Section 12.07 _Governing Law and Venue_ _._

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws of the State of
Delaware.

  


 

  

(b) Except as provided in _Section 1.08_ , each Party agrees that it shall
bring any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
including any question regarding its existence, validity, interpretation,
breach or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration under the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration
(" _LCIA_ "), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this
_Section 12.07(b)_. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this _Section 12.07(b)_ and the Rules of the LCIA, the provisions of this
_Section 12.07(b)_ shall prevail.

  


 

  

(i) The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. The claimant(s) shall
jointly nominate one arbitrator and the respondent(s) shall jointly nominate
one arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who shall be the chairman of the
tribunal, shall be nominated by the two Party-nominated arbitrators within
thirty (30) days of the last of their appointments.

  


 

  

(ii) The seat of the arbitration shall be London, England.

  


 

  

(iii) The language of the arbitration shall be in English.

  


 

  

(iv) The Parties shall not be entitled to discovery, and the arbitrators shall
have no power to order discovery or disclosure of documents, oral testimony or
other materials.

  


 

  

(v) The Parties mutually desire and intend that resolution of any disputes
referred to arbitration will be expeditious. The tribunal shall use its best
efforts to conduct an oral hearing not later than 180 days from the date of
appointment of the presiding arbitrator and to issue its final award not later
than 60 days after the close of the oral hearing. The Parties may extend this
timeline by written agreement. The tribunal may extend this timeline in its
discretion if it considers that the interest of justice so requires. The
tribunal\'s failure to make a final award within this time limit shall not be
a basis for refusing to comply with or for challenging or resisting
enforcement of any such award. Any award of the tribunal shall be final and
binding from the day it is made. The Parties waive any right of application to
determine a preliminary point of law or appeal on a point of law under
Sections 45 and 69 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (UK).

  


 

  

(vi) Nothing in this _Section 12.07(b)_ shall be construed as preventing any
Party from seeking conservatory or similar interim relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

  


 

  

(vii) The Parties agree to keep confidential all matters relating to the
arbitration, including the fact of the arbitration itself and any related
court proceedings, except as required by law or for the purposes of enforcing
this Agreement or an arbitral award.

  

  

 

104  

  

Section 12.08 _Bulk Sale Laws_. Tronox hereby waives compliance by Cristal and
its Affiliates, in connection with the Transactions, with the provisions of
any applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar Law.

  


 

  

Section 12.09 _Obligations of the Parties_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of a Party to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of such Party to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

  


 

  

Section 12.10 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 12.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tronox may assign
this Agreement and any of its rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its Affiliates; provided that such
assignment shall not relieve Tronox of its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

  


 

  

Section 12.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ , the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance
of terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages (and
each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

  


 

  

Section 12.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Each Party (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such Party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other Parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section
12.13.

  

  

 

105  

  

Section 12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered, including by e-mail in PDF format (which shall
constitute a legal and valid signature for purposes hereof and have the same
effect as an original), to the other Parties.

Exchange Act) to vote or deliver a written consent with respect to, or seek to

(d) It is understood and agreed that any action that would be prohibited by
Section 3.1(a) solely due to the fact that (i) Cristal and (ii) [●]5 are
acting as a "group" or otherwise acting in concert shall not be deemed to
violate Section 3.1(a); provided that this Section 3.1(d) does not limit in
any respect Article IV.

(f) The Board has approved an increase in the Voting Power of the Shareholder

voluntary or involuntary proceedings (which is not being contested by the
Company) to liquidate the Company or any of its material Subsidiaries or the
commencement of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
with respect to the Company or any of its material Subsidiaries or (ii) the
adoption of a plan by the Company or any material Subsidiary with respect to
any of the foregoing.

  


 

  

Section 3.3 _Voting_. During the term of this Agreement, at any meeting of the
Company's shareholders, however called, or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof, or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other
approval (including, without limitation, by written consent) is sought or
obtained by or from the shareholders of the Company, the Shareholder shall (a)
cause all of the Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder to be
represented at such meeting for purposes of the presence of a quorum and (b)
shall vote or cause to be voted, in person or by proxy, all of such Voting
Securities as of the applicable record date until the Shareholder no longer
has any nomination rights pursuant to Section 3.4, with respect to any
proposal or resolution relating to (i) the election or removal of Directors,
(ii) compensation of directors, officers or other employees of the Company
(including say-on-pay matters and option grants) and (iii) the engagement of
accountants, in each case, as recommended by the Board.

  


 

  

Section 3.4 _Board of Directors; Committees_.

  


 

  

(a) The Shareholder shall have nomination rights to the Board as follows:

  


 

  

(i) For so long as the Shareholder Beneficially Owns (A) 28,185,000 or more
Voting Securities (which number shall be adjusted to reflect any
consolidation, sub‑division, conversion or similar event affecting the Voting
Securities), the Shareholder shall have the right to designate for nomination
two (2) members of the Board to be elected by the class vote of the holders of
the Class A Shares and (B) 15,568,333 or more, but less than 28,185,000,
Voting Securities (which numbers shall be adjusted to reflect any
consolidation, sub‑division, conversion or similar event affecting the Voting
Securities), the Shareholder shall have the right to designate for nomination
one (1) member of the Board to be elected by the class vote of the holders of
the Class A Shares; provided, however, that if following any amendment or
other change to the Constitution or successor governing documents of the
Company only a single class of shares is outstanding, the right to designate
for nomination members of the Board shall continue to apply until the Cut-off
Time.

  

  

 

\- 10 -  

  

(ii) At least forty (40) Business Days prior to an annual general meeting or
any special meeting of shareholders of the Company at which the Directors are
to be elected to the Board, the Company shall notify the Shareholder of the
date of such proposed meeting. Within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such
notification, the Shareholder shall designate for nomination Shareholder
Nominee(s) in accordance with Section 3.4(a)(i). Within five (5) Business Days
of receiving such designation, the Company shall notify the Shareholder in
writing if the Nominating Committee either (A) intends to recommend to the
Company's shareholders the election of such Shareholder Nominees, or (B) does
not intend to recommend to the Company's shareholders the election of such
Shareholder Nominees (provided, however, that the Company shall procure that
the Nominating Committee shall only fail to recommend to the Company's
shareholders the election of a Shareholder Nominee if (1) such Shareholder
Nominee fails to meet any director qualification requirements expressly set
forth in the Constitution, or (2) such recommendation would otherwise breach
the fiduciary duties of the members of the Nominating Committee). If the
Nominating Committee does not intend to recommend to the Company's
shareholders the election of any such Shareholder Nominee, the Company shall
procure that the Nominating Committee promptly notifies the Shareholder of
such intention and provides reasonable justification as to why such
Shareholder Nominee will not be recommended to the Company's shareholders. The
Shareholder shall, within five (5) Business Days of being informed of such
intention, have the right to designate for nomination alternative Shareholder
Nominee(s) (and the Shareholder can provide a list of alternative Shareholder
Nominees which are to be considered by the Nominating Committee for
recommendation to the Company's shareholders in descending order of
preference) and the Company shall procure that the Nominating Committee
considers such alternative Shareholder Nominees. Again, the Company shall
procure that the Nominating Committee shall only fail to recommend to the
Company's shareholders the election of an alternative Shareholder Nominee if
(1) such alternative Shareholder Nominee fails to meet any director
qualification requirements expressly set forth in the Constitution, or (2)
such recommendation would otherwise breach the fiduciary duties of the members
of the Nominating Committee.

  


 

  

(iii) Without limiting the specificity of Section 3.4(a)(ii), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Board to take all action
necessary (including, subject to the Board's fiduciary duties, recommending
the election of Shareholder Nominees to the Company's shareholders) such that,
of the number of Directors nominated for election at each annual general
meeting or any special meeting of shareholders of the Company at which the
Directors are to be elected to the Board, the Shareholder Nominees designated
for nomination in accordance with Section 3.4(a)(i) shall be elected as
Directors, subject, in each case, to applicable Law.

  


 

  

(iv) Upon prior reasonable written notice by the Company to the Shareholder,
the Shareholder shall supply to the Company by the time such information is
reasonably requested by the Board, the following information insofar as it
relates to a Shareholder Nominee: (A) all such information and materials as
the Company reasonably requests from other members of the Board as is required
to be disclosed in proxy circulars under applicable Law or as is otherwise
reasonably requested by the Company from time-to-time from members of the
Board in connection with the Company's legal, regulatory, auditor or stock
exchange requirements (including, if applicable, any Directors' questionnaire
or similar document); and (B) an executed consent to serve as a Director if so
elected from each of the Shareholder Nominees to be named as a nominee in any
proxy circular or similar materials for any annual meeting or special meeting
of shareholders of the Company (collectively, the " _Nomination Documents_ ").

  

  

 

\- 11 -  

  

(v) If any Shareholder Director resigns from the Board or is rendered unable
to, or refuses to, or for any other reason ceases, to serve on the Board, the
Shareholder shall be entitled to designate a replacement (a " _Replacement_
"), and, subject to Section 3.4(b), the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly appoint such Replacement as a replacement Shareholder
Director to fill the resulting vacancy. If, despite using its reasonable best
efforts to promptly appoint such Replacement, the Company is unable to
promptly appoint such Replacement, the Shareholder shall be entitled to
designate an alternative Replacement and the provisions of this Section
3.4(a)(v) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such alternative Replacement. Any
such Replacement elected to the Board shall be deemed to be a Shareholder
Director for all purposes under this Agreement, and prior to his or her
appointment to the Board, shall be required to provide to the Company the
Nomination Documents as set forth in Section 3.4(a)(iv).

  


 

  

(b) Upon the first date that the Shareholder Beneficially Owns (i) less than
28,185,000 Voting Securities (which number shall be adjusted to reflect any
consolidation, sub‑division, conversion or similar event affecting the Voting
Securities), the Shareholder shall promptly cause one (1) Shareholder Director
designated by the Shareholder to tender his or her immediate resignation from
the Board, and (ii) less than 15,568,333 Voting Securities (which number shall
be adjusted to reflect any consolidation, sub‑division, conversion or similar
event affecting the Voting Securities), the Shareholder shall promptly
following such time (the " _Cut-off Time_ ") cause any Shareholder Director
designated by the Shareholder to tender his or her immediate resignation from
the Board. Subject to Section 3.4(a)(i), the resignation of a Shareholder
Director does not prevent such person from being eligible for election or
appointment as a Director in the future.

  


 

  

(c) For so long as such membership is permitted by all applicable Law and
stock exchange listing requirements (as determined in good faith by the
Board), the Board will cause the number of Shareholder Directors, if any, to
serve as members of the various standing committees of the Board (other than
the Nominating Committee but including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Corporate Governance Committee) proportional to their representation on the
Board, rounded down to the larger of the nearest whole number and one.

  


 

  

(d) At all times from the date of this Agreement through the termination of
their service as a member of the Board, each of the Shareholder Directors
shall comply with the qualification requirements applicable to all directors
expressly set forth under the Constitution, and all policies, procedures,
processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to all Board
members, including the Company's code of business conduct and ethics,
securities trading policies, Directors' confidentiality policy, and corporate
governance guidelines, and preserve the confidentiality of Company business
and information, including discussions of matters considered in meetings of
the Board or Board committees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, each Shareholder Director is authorized to disclose confidential
information on a strictly confidential basis to any director, officer or
employee of the Shareholder that appointed him or any director, officer or
management-level employee of such Shareholder\'s Affiliates to the extent
necessary for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating such Shareholder\'s
participation with the Company.

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

  


 

  

Section 4.1 _Transfer Restrictions_. Except as expressly provided in this
Article IV, or in accordance with a written consent granted by a committee of
the Board consisting solely of Independent Directors (the " _Committee_ "),
for the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date immediately
following the three (3) year anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Transfer
Prohibition Period_ "), the Co-op shall not Transfer any of the Voting
Securities Beneficially Owned by it, other than, following the later of (i)
the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date hereof (the "
_Termination Date_ ") and (ii) the date on which all claims for
indemnification under Section 9.01(a) of the Transaction Agreement asserted in
writing by the Company prior to the Termination Date have been finally
resolved, to a Permitted Transferee; provided, however, that no such transfer
shall be permitted if such transfer will result in an "owner shift" under
Section 382(g) of the Code with respect to the Company. Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer of Voting Securities in violation of this Section 4.1
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be null and void ab initio, and
the Company shall not, and shall instruct its transfer agent and other third
parties not to, record or recognize any such purported transaction on the
share register of the Company. The Board has approved Transfers made to
Permitted Transferees in accordance with this Section 4.1 such that such
Transfers are exempted from rule 11.3 of the Constitution.

  


 

  

Section 4.2 _Waiver of Transfer Restrictions_.

  


 

  

(a) Notwithstanding the restriction in Section 4.1, during the Transfer
Prohibition Period, (i) in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(or any similar rule then in force) (" _Rule 144_ "), including the volume and
manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144, or (ii) under the Initial
Registration Statement, the Shareholder may, directly or indirectly, sell or
transfer in accordance with all applicable Laws, up to an aggregate of [insert
number of shares equal to [4]% of the total number of outstanding Voting
Securities immediately after the Closing] Voting Securities, as adjusted for
any stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction (the " _Waived
Transfer Amount_ "); provided, however, that promptly following any sale or
transfer pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) that is included in the Waived
Transfer Amount the Shareholder shall provide to the Company a written notice
stating (x) the quantum of Voting Securities subject to such sale or transfer,
and (y) the portion of the Waived Transfer Amount allocated to such sale or
transfer; provided, further, that the sale or transfer of such Waived Transfer
Amount shall not be reasonably expected, based on the advice of an
internationally recognized investment bank selected by the Shareholder and
approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), to
materially and adversely affect the trading of the Voting Securities of the
Company on the NYSE.

  

  

 

\- 13 -  

  

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC reasonably promptly following the date
hereof, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the date hereof, a Short
Form Registration statement covering the resale of a number of Registrable
Securities up to the Waived Transfer Amount (the " _Initial Registration
Statement_ ") and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Initial
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof, and in any event within one-hundred
twenty (120) days after the date hereof. The Company shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to keep such Initial Registration Statement
continually effective until all of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Initial Registration Statement cease to constitute Registrable Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to postpone the
filing of the Initial Registration Statement or the using of its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Initial Registration Statement to be declared
effective to the same extent that it is entitled to prohibit sales of
Registrable Securities under an effective Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 5.1(d) below. The Company shall be liable for and pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with the Initial Registration Statement, regardless of
whether such registration is effected. The provisions of Section 5.3 shall
apply mutatis mutandis to the registration of Registrable Securities pursuant
to this Section 4.2(b).

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2(a),
beginning on the day following the expiry of the Transfer Prohibition Period,
the Shareholder may, subject to Section 4.3, directly or indirectly Transfer
any of the Voting Securities held directly or indirectly by it, and Sections
4.1 and 4.2(a) of this Agreement shall be of no further effect.

  


 

  

(d) The restrictions and limitations on Transfers contained in this Article IV
shall not apply to acceptance of any takeover offer for all the Voting
Securities in the Company where the Shareholder is not a participant in or a
member of the offeror's group.

  


 

  

Section 4.3 _Additional Transfer Restrictions_. In addition to the
restrictions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2(a), so long as this Agreement
has not terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Shareholder shall not, other
than in connection with a registered public offering, including any
underwritten offering or a Change of Control transaction, knowingly Transfer
Voting Securities (a) to a Person or group, other than to any Permitted
Transferee, who, after such acquisition, would, together with its Affiliates,
Beneficially Own in excess of 5% of the outstanding Voting Securities; or (b)
on any given day (other than to any Permitted Transferee) in an amount greater
than 10% of the average daily trading volume of the Voting Securities for the
twenty (20)-day period immediately preceding the date of such Transfer.

  


 

  

Section 4.4 _Legend_.

  


 

  

(a) All certificates or other instruments representing the Voting Securities
owned by the Shareholder will bear the following legend:

  


 

  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT WHILE A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

  

  

 

\- 14 -  

  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER,
OWNERSHIP AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT,
DATED [●], 2017, BY AND BETWEEN TRONOX LIMITED, CRISTAL INORGANIC CHEMICALS
NETHERLANDS COÖPERATIEF W.A., AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE OTHER PARTIES THERETO,
AS IT MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, COPIES OF WHICH ARE ON FILE WITH AND
AVAILABLE FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY, WITHOUT COST.

  


 

  

(b) Within one (1) Business Day after receipt by the Company of a demand by
the Shareholder, the Company agrees, in connection with any Transfer of Voting
Securities in compliance with applicable Law and as permitted by this
Agreement, to remove the aforementioned legend from any certificate or other
instrument representing such Voting Securities.

  


 

  

ARTICLE V

  

  

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

  


 

  

Section 5.1 _Demand Registrations_.

  


 

  

(a) _Requests for Registration_. At any time following the expiration of the
Transfer Prohibition Period, the Shareholder may request in writing that the
Company effect the registration under the Securities Act of all or any part of
the Registrable Securities held by the Shareholder (a " _Registration Request_
"). Promptly after its receipt of any Registration Request, the Company will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to register, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, all Registrable Securities (as defined below)
that have been requested to be registered in the Registration Request. Any
registration requested by the Shareholder pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(c)
is referred to in this Agreement as a " _Demand Registration_." As used
herein, the term " _Registrable Securities_ " shall mean (i) Class A Shares;
(ii) any other shares or securities that the Shareholder may be entitled to
receive, or will have received, pursuant to the Shareholder's ownership of the
Class A Shares, in lieu of or in addition to the Class A Shares; and (iii) any
shares or securities issued or issuable directly or indirectly with respect to
the shares referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) by way of
conversion or exchange thereof or share distribution or share split or in
connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation or other reorganization, in
each case held by the Shareholder. As to any particular securities
constituting Registrable Securities, such securities will cease to be
Registrable Securities when (A) they have been effectively registered for sale
under the Securities Act pursuant to a Registration Statement (as defined
below) and disposed of in accordance with the Registration Statement; (B) they
have been sold to the public pursuant to Rule 144 or other exemption from
registration under the Securities Act; (C) they have been bought back and
cancelled by the Company; or (D) when all remaining Registrable Securities can
be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without limitation.

  

  

 

\- 15 -  

  

(b) _Limitation on Demand Registrations_. At any time following the expiration
of the Transfer Prohibition Period, the Shareholder will be entitled to
initiate no more than three (3) Demand Registrations (including Short-Form
Registrations permitted pursuant to Section 5.1(c)). _No request_ for
registration _will count_ for the purposes of the limitations in this Section
5.1(b) _if_ (i) the Shareholder determines in good faith to withdraw the
proposed registration prior to the effectiveness of the prospectus and other
documents filed with the SEC to effect a registration under the Securities Act
(" _Registration Statement_ ") relating to such request due to marketing
conditions (but only if the Shareholder reimburses the Company for all fees
with respect thereto) or regulatory reasons relating to the Company, (ii) the
Registration Statement relating to such request is not declared effective
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date such Registration Statement
is first filed with the SEC (other than solely by reason of matters relating
to the Shareholder) and the Shareholder withdraws its Registration Request
prior to such Registration Statement being declared effective, (iii) prior to
the sale of at least 90% of the Registrable Securities included in the
applicable registration relating to such request, such registration is
adversely affected by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement
of the SEC or other Governmental Entity for any reason and the Company fails
to have such stop order, injunction or other order of requirement removed,
withdrawn or resolved to the Shareholder's reasonable satisfaction within
thirty (30) days of the date of such order or injunction, (iv) more than 10%
of the Registrable Securities requested by the Shareholder to be included in
the registration are not so included pursuant to Section 5.1(d), (v) the
conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement or purchase
agreement entered into in connection with the registration relating to such
request are not satisfied (other than as a result of a material default or
breach thereunder by the Shareholder), or (vi) more than 10% of the
Registrable Securities requested by the Shareholder to be included in the
registration cannot be sold due to the restrictions on Transfer contained in
_Article IV_.

  


 

  

(c) _Short-Form Registrations_. Following the expiration of the Transfer
Prohibition Period, the Company will, if requested by the Shareholder and the
use of such form is then available to the Company, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3
(including any successor form thereto, " _Short Form Registration_ ")
providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed
basis of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act. In no event shall the Company be obligated to effect any shelf
registration other than pursuant to a Short-Form Registration.

  


 

  

(d) _Restrictions on Demand Registrations_. If the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement, including a Short
Form Registration, with respect to a Demand Registration would (i) require the
Company to make a public disclosure of material non-public information, which
disclosure in the good faith judgment of the Company (A) would be required to
be made in any Registration Statement so that such Registration Statement
would not be materially misleading, (B) would not be required to be made at
such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of such
Registration Statement and (C) would in the good faith judgment of the Company
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Company or
its business if made at such time, or (ii) would in the good faith judgment of
the Board reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Company or
its business or on the Company's ability to effect a planned or proposed
acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction, then the Company may upon giving prompt written notice of
such action to the participants in such registration (each of whom hereby
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information disclosed to such
participants) delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of,
such Registration Statement, provided, however, that the Company shall not be
permitted to do so (x) more than two (2) times during any twelve (12)-month
period or (y) for periods exceeding, in the aggregate, one hundred (100) days
during any twelve (12)-month period. In the event the Company exercises its
rights under the preceding sentence, the Shareholder agrees to suspend,
promptly upon its receipt of the notice referred to above, its use of any
prospectus relating to such registration in connection with any sale or offer
to sell Registrable Securities. If the Company so postpones the filing of a
prospectus or the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, the Shareholder
will be entitled to withdraw such request and, if such request is withdrawn,
such registration request will not count for the purposes of the limitation
set forth in Section 5.1(b) and the Company shall, for the avoidance of doubt,
pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such registration.

  

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

(e) _Selection of Underwriters_. If the Shareholder intends that the
Registrable Securities covered by its Registration Request shall be
distributed by means of an underwritten offering, the Shareholder will so
advise the Company as a part of the Registration Request. In such event, the
lead underwriter to administer the offering will be an Approved Bank chosen by
the Shareholder.

  


 

  

(f) _Priority on Demand Registrations_. If a Demand Registration involves an
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the Company that in
its reasonable opinion the number of Registrable Securities (and any other
securities requested to be included in such offering) exceeds the number of
securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share
offering price), the Company will include in such offering only such number of
securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriter can be sold
without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an
adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities will be so
included in the following order of priority: (i) first, Registrable Securities
of the Shareholder and (ii) second, any other securities of the Company that
have been requested to be so included.

  


 

  

Section 5.2 _Piggyback Registrations_.

  


 

  

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. At any time following the Transfer Prohibition
Period, and subject to the restrictions and limitations on transfers contained
in Article IV, whenever the Company proposes to register any of its securities
(other than a registration statement to be filed on Form S-8 or Form S-4 or
any similar form from time to time or registration of shares, securities
and/or options or other rights in respect thereof to be offered to directors,
members of management, employees, consultants, lenders or vendors of the
Company or in connection with dividend reinvestment plans, each a " _Special
Registration_ ") and other than a registration pursuant to Section 5.1, and
the registration form to be filed may be used for the registration or
qualification for distribution of Registrable Securities, the Company will
give prompt written notice (and in any event no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the filing of a Registration Statement with respect to
such registration) to the Shareholder of its intention to effect such a
registration and, subject to Section 5.2(c), will include in such registration
all Registrable Securities of the Shareholder with respect to which the
Company has received a written request from the Shareholder for inclusion
therein within five (5) Business Days after the date of the Company's notice
(a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this
Section 5.2 prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not
the Shareholder has elected to include its Registrable Securities in such
registration, and the Company will have no liability to the Shareholder in
connection with such termination or withdrawal. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Piggyback Registration shall not be considered a Demand Registration for the
purposes of the limitations set forth in Section 5.1(b).

  

  

 

\- 17 -  

  

(b) _Underwritten Registration_. If the registration referred to in Section
5.2(a) is proposed to be underwritten, the Company will so advise the
Shareholder as a part of the written notice given pursuant to Section 5.2(a).
In such event, the right of the Shareholder to registration pursuant to this
Section 5.2 will be conditioned upon the Shareholder's (together with the
Company's) entry into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting. If the
registration referred to in Section 5.2(a) is proposed to be underwritten and
is initiated as a primary offering on behalf of the Company, the Company shall
select the investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter
or underwriters in connection with such offering.

  


 

  

(c) _Priority on Primary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration relates
to an underwritten offering, and the managing underwriters advise the Company
that in their reasonable opinion the number of securities requested to be
included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering
(including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company
will include in such offering only such number of securities that in the
reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price), which securities will be so included in the
following order of priority: (i) first, the securities the Company proposes to
sell, and (ii) second, other securities of the Company that have been
requested to be so included pro rata on the basis of the number of securities
requested to be registered by the Shareholder or any other holder of
securities.

  


 

  

Section 5.3 _Registration Procedures_. Subject to Section 5.1(d), whenever the
Shareholder requests that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to
Sections 5.1 or 5.2 of this Agreement, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the registration and sale of such Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable in
accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant
thereto the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

  


 

  

(a) prepare and file within sixty (60) days of a request, with the SEC, a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities, cooperate
in all required filings with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable;
provided, however, that before filing a Registration Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will, in the case of a Demand
Registration, furnish to counsel to the Shareholder copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to review and
comment by such counsel, and the Company will make such reasonable changes to
the Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto (including
changes to, or the filing of amendments reflecting such changes to, documents
incorporated by reference) as may be reasonably requested by the Shareholder
subject to the Company's obligations with respect to such Registration
Statement;

  

  

 

\- 18 -  

  

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for a period of either (i) not less than (A) three (3) months, (B)
if such Registration Statement relates to an underwritten offering, such
longer period as a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection
with sales of Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer or (C) one
(1) year in the case of shelf registration statements (or in each case such
shorter period ending on the date that the securities covered by such shelf
registration statement cease to constitute Registrable Securities) or (ii)
such shorter period as will terminate when all of the securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in
such Registration Statement (but in any event not before the expiration of any
longer period required under the Securities Act), and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of
such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods
of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement;

  


 

  

(c) furnish to the Shareholder such number of copies, without charge, of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, including each
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, any other prospectus (which for
purposes of this Agreement shall also include any prospectus filed under Rule
424, Rule 430A or Rule 430B under the Securities Act and any "issuer free
writing prospectus" as such term is defined under Rule 433 promulgated under
the Securities Act), all exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such
other documents as the Shareholder may reasonably request including in order
to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by the
Shareholder;

  


 

  

(d) register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Shareholder
reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things that may be
reasonably necessary to enable the Shareholder to consummate the disposition
in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by the Shareholder
(provided, however, that the Company will not be required to (i) qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this subsection, (ii) subject itself to taxation
in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any
such jurisdiction);

  


 

  

(e) notify the Shareholder, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, upon discovery that, or
upon the discovery of the happening of any event as a result of which, the
prospectus contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and, as soon as reasonably
practicable, prepare and furnish to the Shareholder a reasonable number of
copies of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made;

  

  

 

\- 19 -  

  

(f) notify the Shareholder (i) when such Registration Statement or the
prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been
filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC
for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or to amend or to
supplement such prospectus or for additional information, and (iii) of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for any of such
purposes;

  


 

  

(g) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

  


 

  

(h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities
not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement;

  


 

  

(i) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements
and lock-up agreements in customary form, and including provisions with
respect to indemnification and contribution in customary form) and take all
such other customary actions as the Shareholder or the underwriters, if any,
reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities (including making members of senior management of the
Company available to participate in "road show" and other customary marketing
activities to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of the
Company);

  


 

  

(j) make available for inspection by the Shareholder and counsel to the
Shareholder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such
Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by
the Shareholder or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and documents relating to the business of the Company, and
cause the Company's officers, directors, employees and independent accountants
to supply all information reasonably requested by the Shareholder,
underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such
Registration Statement; provided, however, that it shall be a condition to
such inspection and receipt of such information that the inspecting person (i)
enter into a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and (ii) agree to minimize the disruption to the
Company's business in connection with the foregoing;

  


 

  

(k) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain the
withdrawal of such order;

  


 

  

(l) obtain one or more comfort letters, addressed to the underwriters, if any,
dated the effective date of such Registration Statement and the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement for such offering, signed by the
Company's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by comfort letters as such
underwriters shall reasonably request; and

  

  


 

  

 

\- 20 -  

  

(m) provide customary legal opinions of the Company's counsel, addressed to
the underwriters, if any, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement, with respect to the Registration Statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto (including the preliminary prospectus) and such other
documents relating thereto as the underwriter shall reasonably request in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
legal opinions of such nature.

  


 

  

Section 5.4 _Furnishing of Information_. As a condition to registering
Registrable Securities of the Shareholder, the Company may require the
Shareholder to furnish the Company with such information regarding the
Shareholder and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the
registration and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from
time to time reasonably request in writing.

  


 

  

Section 5.5 _Registration Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all expenses incidental to the Company's performance of or
compliance with this Agreement, including all registration and filing fees,
fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws and printing
expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company and all independent certified public accountants of
the Company and other persons retained by the Company (collectively, "
_Registration Expenses_ "), will be borne by the Company. All underwriting
discounts, selling commissions and transfer taxes applicable to the sale of
Registrable Securities of the Shareholder or its Affiliates hereunder and any
other expenses required by Law to be paid by the Shareholder will be borne by
the Shareholder.

  


 

  

Section 5.6 _Holdback_. In consideration for the Company agreeing to its
obligations under this Agreement, the Shareholder agrees in connection with
any registration of Voting Securities (whether or not the Shareholder is
participating in such registration) upon the request of the Company and the
underwriters managing any underwritten offering of Voting Securities, not to
effect (other than pursuant to such registration) any public sale or
distribution or other Transfer of Registrable Securities, including, but not
limited to, any sale pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A, without the prior
written consent of the Company or such underwriters, as the case may be,
during the Holdback Period (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Holdback Period_ " means, with respect to any registered offering covered
by this Agreement, (i) one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to customary
"booster shot" provisions, after and during the ten (10) days before, the
effective date of the related Registration Statement or, in the case of a
takedown from a shelf registration statement, ninety (90) days after the date
of the prospectus supplement filed with the SEC in connection with such
takedown and during such prior period (not to exceed ten days) as the Company
has given reasonable written notice to the Shareholder or (ii) such shorter
period as the Company, the Shareholder and the underwriter of such offering,
if any, shall agree.

  


 

  

Section 5.7 _Registration in Foreign Jurisdictions_. If the Company does not
list its Voting Securities in the United States and instead lists its Voting
Securities in a jurisdiction other than the United States, then the Company
and the Shareholder shall negotiate in good faith to enter into such
amendments to this Agreement as are necessary to ensure that the Shareholder
retains registration rights substantially similar to those granted under this
Agreement, as and to the extent permissible under the Laws of such other
jurisdiction.

  

  

 

\- 21 -  

  

Section 5.8 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the
Shareholder the benefits of certain SEC rules and regulations that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration
after such time as a public market exists for the Registrable Securities, the
Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take the following
actions:

  


 

  

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144, at all times after the date that the Company becomes
subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act;

  


 

  

(b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and

  


 

  

(c) furnish to the Shareholder forthwith upon request a written statement by
the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144,
and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has
become subject to such reporting requirements) and such other reports and
documents as the Shareholder may reasonably request in connection with
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell any
Registrable Securities without registration.

ARTICLE VI

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION and CONTRIBUTION

  


 

  

Section 6.1 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

  

 

  

(a) The Company shall, and it hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless
each Shareholder and its controlled Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, members, employees, managers, partners, accountants, attorneys and
agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act) such Persons, in any offering or sale of the Registrable
Securities, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
actions or proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) in respect thereof
and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) (collectively, " _Claims_
") to which each such indemnified Person may become subject, insofar as such
Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement effected with the consent of
the Company as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof,
arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact in any registration statement used to register Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact in any prospectus or preliminary
prospectus used to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
the Company shall, and it hereby agrees to, reimburse periodically (but, in
any event, within one month of such expenses being incurred) the indemnified
Persons for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claims; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable to any such Person in any such
case only to the extent that any such Claims arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in such registration statement, or preliminary or final prospectus, or
amendment or supplement thereto, made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by the Shareholder or its
Affiliates expressly for use therein. The Shareholder shall, and hereby
agrees, to (A) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
officers, employees and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons, if any, in any offering or
sale of Registrable Securities, against any Claims to which each such
indemnified Person may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any
amounts paid in settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in
respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon (1) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement used to
register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference
therein, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
(2) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any
prospectus or preliminary prospectus used to register Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or
any document incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder expressly for use therein, and (B)
reimburse the Company for any documented legal or other out-of-pocket expenses
reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder shall
not be liable under this Section 6.1(a) for amounts in excess of the proceeds
(net of underwriting discounts and commissions) received by such Shareholder
in the offering giving rise to such liability.

  

  

 

\- 23 -  

  

(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified Person under Section 6.1(a) of
written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding for which
indemnification under Section 6.1(a) may be requested, such indemnified Person
shall notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such
action or proceeding; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified
Person in respect of such action or proceeding hereunder except to the extent
the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure of the
indemnified Person to give such notice, and in no event shall such omission
relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability it may have to such
indemnified Person. In case any such action or proceeding shall be brought
against any indemnified Person, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it shall determine, jointly with
any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified Person, and,
after written notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified Person of
its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified Person for any legal or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified Person in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of
investigation; provided, however, that (i) if the indemnifying party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding
within twenty (20) days after receiving written notice from such indemnified
Person that the indemnified Person believes it has failed to do so; (ii) if
such indemnified Person who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which
is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably shall have concluded
(upon advice of competent counsel) that there may be one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to such indemnified Person which are not
available to the indemnifying party; (iii) if representation of both parties
by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate (in the reasonable opinion of
the indemnified Person's counsel) under applicable standards of professional
conduct, or (iv) such action or proceeding seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against an indemnified Person or involves actual or alleged criminal
activity, then, in any such case, the indemnified Person shall have the right
to assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more
than one firm of counsel for all indemnified Persons in each jurisdiction) and
the indemnifying party shall be liable for any reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses therefor (including, without limitation, any such
reasonable counsel's fees). If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified Person
with respect to such claim. The indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No indemnifying party shall,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified Person, compromise or
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement agreement with
respect to any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is
sought under Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b) (whether or not the indemnified
Person is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such compromise,
consent or settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified
Person from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, does not
subject the indemnified Person to any obligations, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy and does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified Person.

  


 

  

(c) The Shareholder and the Company agree that if, for any reason, the
indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6.1(a) hereof are
unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified Person in
respect of any Claims referred to herein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a
result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified
Person, on the other hand, with respect to statements or omissions that
resulted in such Claims. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and
indemnified Person shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied
by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified Person, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the
second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable Law, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified Person, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentences of this Section 6.1(c). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified Person as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed
to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.1(b) hereof) any
documented and out-of-pocket legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified Person in connection with investigating or
defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder
shall not be required to make a contribution in excess of the proceeds (net of
underwriting discounts and commissions) received by such Person from the sale
of its Registrable Securities in connection with the offering that gave rise
to the contribution obligation.

ARTICLE VII

  

  

OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

  


 

  

Section 7.1 _Access to Information_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Shareholder shall, and
shall cause its representatives and the Shareholder Directors, to keep
confidential all information and documents of the Company and its Affiliates
obtained by a Shareholder Director in such Shareholder Director's capacity as
a Director unless such information (1) is or becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.1(a) by the Shareholder,
including by way of actions taken by its representatives or a Shareholder
Director; (2) was within the possession of the Shareholder or a Shareholder
Director prior to it being furnished such information by or on behalf of the
Company on a non‑confidential basis; provided, that the source of such
information was not known by the Shareholder, its representatives or a
Shareholder Director after due inquiry to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other contractual, fiduciary or legal obligation of
confidentiality to, the Company with respect to such information; or (3) is or
becomes available to the Shareholder or a Shareholder Director on a
non‑confidential basis from a source other than the Company or any of its
representatives; provided, that such source was not known to the Shareholder
or a Shareholder Director after due inquiry to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other contractual, fiduciary or legal obligation of
confidentiality to, the Company with respect to such information. Nothing in
this Section 7.1(a) shall prevent the Shareholder Directors, subject to
compliance with applicable fiduciary duties, from sharing information with the
Shareholder, which information will continue to be covered by the
confidentiality provisions of this Section 7.1(a).

  


 

  

(b) The Shareholder may, at its expense on a business day during normal
business hours, with reasonable prior notice to the Company's management,
visit and inspect the Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties, examine its
books of account and records, and discuss with members of management such
company's affairs, finances, and accounts. The Company shall provide to the
Shareholder copies of the Monthly Accounts within 30 days following the end of
each calendar month, and within 45 days following the end of each fiscal half-
year and within 45 days following the end of each fiscal year, such other
financial information about the Company's operations as is necessary to permit
the Shareholder to prepare the financial disclosures required to satisfy the
Shareholder's disclosure obligations. For purposes of this Section 7.1(b), "
_Monthly Accounts_ " means, to the extent prepared in the ordinary course of
business, the Company's unaudited, consolidated financial statements,
including the balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows, for the
relevant monthly period, prepared in accordance with IFRS, separately
identifying inter-company and related party transactions but not including
footnotes.

  

  

 

\- 25 -  

  

(c) The Shareholder hereby acknowledges that as a result of its receipt of
information regarding the Company and its Affiliates it may be, or be treated
as being, in possession of material non‑public information (which for the
purposes of this Section 7.1(c) includes information which could reasonably be
expected to have a material effect on the price or value of a company's
securities) and it is aware of and agrees to comply with (and it will procure
that its Affiliates and representatives comply with) securities laws in
Australia and the United States in relation to that material non‑public
information. In addition, the Shareholder acknowledges that other foreign
securities laws may prohibit any person who has received from an issuer
material, non‑public information from purchasing or selling securities of such
issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely
to purchase or sell such securities.

  


 

  

Section 7.2 _Pre-emptive Rights_.

  


 

  

(a) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date on
which the Shareholder Beneficially Owns less than 11,743,750 Voting Securities
(which number shall be adjusted to reflect any consolidation, sub‑division,
conversion or similar event affecting the Voting Securities), if the Company
issues any additional Voting Securities (an " _Additional Issuance_ "), except
for issuances pursuant to (i) any option to acquire Voting Securities,
warrant, convertible security or other right to purchase shares of the Company
existing at the date of the Transaction Agreement, (ii) any benefit plan or
other employee or director plan or arrangement or any awards granted
thereunder, (iii) an employee share ownership or purchase plan, or (iv) any
share split, share distribution or similar distribution made available to
holders of Voting Securities generally (including the Shareholder) (each a "
_Permitted Issuance_ "), then during the 30‑day period following the date on
which the Company has given the Shareholder written notice of the occurrence
of the Additional Issuance, the Shareholder shall be entitled to subscribe for
(and the Company must, subject to the Corporations Act, issue), at the then
Current Market Price (as defined below) of Class A Shares, up to that number
of Class A Shares obtained by calculating, on the third business day (as
defined in the Constitution) prior to the closing date of such issue, (1) the
product of (A) the quotient of (x) the number of Class A Shares owned by the
Shareholder immediately prior to the Additional Issuance divided by (y) the
aggregate number of Voting Securities immediately prior to the Additional
Issuance and (B) the aggregate number of Voting Securities being issued by the
Company in the Additional Issuance and (2) subtracting from such product the
number of Class A Shares, if any, issued to, or purchased by, the Shareholder
in such Additional Issuance and the number of Voting Securities otherwise
acquired by the Shareholder during the period beginning on the date of the
Additional Issuance until the third business day prior to the closing date of
such issue.

  

  

 

\- 26 -  

  

(b) For purposes hereof, the " _Current Market Price_ " on the date of the
calculation thereof shall be deemed to be the arithmetic average of the volume
weighted average price per Class A Share for each of the 30 consecutive
Trading Days immediately prior to such date (x) if the Class A Shares are not
listed or admitted for trading on any national, international or foreign
securities exchange but trades in the Class A Shares are otherwise quoted or
reported by the OTC Bulletin Board service (the " _OTCBB_ ") or such other
quotation system then in use, as reported by Bloomberg (or in the event such
price is not so reported for any such Trading Day for any reason or is
manifestly erroneous, as reasonably determined by an Approved Bank), or (y) if
the Class A Shares are listed or admitted for trading on any national,
international or foreign securities exchange, as reported by such exchange
(provided, that if the Class A Shares are listed on more than one national,
international or foreign securities exchange, then the national, international
or foreign securities exchange with the highest average trading volume for the
Class A Shares during the 30 Trading Day period shall be used for such
purpose; provided, further, that in the event such price is not so reported
for any such Trading Day for any reason or is manifestly erroneous, as
reasonably determined by an Approved Bank); provided, however, that in the
event that the Current Market Price per share of the applicable Voting
Securities is determined during a period following the announcement by the
Company of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Voting Securities payable in
such Voting Securities or securities convertible into such Voting Securities,
or (B) any conversion, subdivision, combination, consolidation, reverse share
split or reclassification of such Voting Securities, and the ex‑dividend date
for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such conversion,
subdivision, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or
reclassification shall not have occurred prior to the commencement of the
requisite 30 Trading Day period, then the Current Market Price shall be
properly adjusted to take into account ex‑dividend trading.

  


 

  

(c) If the Class A Shares are not publicly held or not so listed or traded,
Current Market Price per share shall mean the fair value per share as
determined in good faith by an Approved Bank (as defined below), whose
determination shall be conclusive for all purposes. The term " _Trading Day_ "
shall mean a day on which the OTCBB is open for the transaction of business
or, if the Class A Shares are listed or admitted to trading on the applicable
national, international or foreign securities exchange, a day on which such
national, international or foreign securities exchange is open for transaction
of business. For the purposes of this Section 7.2 only, the term " _Approved
Bank_ " shall mean the highest-ranking investment bank (other than the first-
ranked investment bank) as determined by reference to the Thomson Reuters
League Tables (or successor thereto) for worldwide mergers and acquisitions
for the most recently completed calendar year that is willing to perform such

(i) having Beneficial Ownership of (A) any Voting Securities or (B) up to and
including 4.9% of any class of outstanding securities of any other Person;
provided that if the Beneficial Ownership by such Person or any of its
Affiliates of the securities of any other Person exceeds 4.9% of any class of
outstanding securities of such Person as a result of a combination of shares,
recapitalization, consolidation or other reorganization of such Person, there
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.3(a)(i) if such first
Person or its applicable Affiliate divests or causes the divestiture of an
amount of the securities of such second Person necessary for such first Person
or its applicable Affiliate to Beneficially Own 4.9% or less of the applicable
class of outstanding securities of such second Person within twelve months
after the date of such combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation
or other reorganization;

  


 

  

(ii) conducting the Other Cristal Businesses (as defined in the Transaction

carrying on the Acquired Competing Business if such Acquired Competing
Business comprises less than the greater of (A) 20% of the revenues of the
Acquired Business (measured as of the completed calendar year preceding the
year in which the acquisition of the Acquired Business is completed), but not
more than $200,000,000 of the aggregate revenues of the Acquired Business in
such calendar year (measured using the Exchange Rate (as defined in the
Transaction Agreement) as of the last Business Day of such calendar year) and
(B) $50,000,000 of the revenues of such Acquired Business (measured as of the
completed calendar year preceding the year in which the acquisition of the
Acquired Business is completed and using the Exchange Rate as of the last
Business Day of such preceding calendar year); provided, that if neither
clause (A) nor (B) applies, such Person or its Affiliates may consummate the
acquisition of such Acquired Business, provided further that such Person or
its applicable Affiliates shall enter into a definitive agreement to divest
such Acquired Competing Business within six months following the date on which
such Acquired Business was acquired. If the divestiture of an Acquired
Competing Business is required pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iii), such
Person shall provide notice to Triangle, and such Person shall not, and shall
not permit or cause any of its Affiliates to, enter into any definitive
agreement regarding such divestiture without first commencing and conducting
in good faith for not less than 20 Business Days negotiations with Triangle
regarding a potential acquisition by Triangle or its Affiliates of such
Acquired Competing Business.

  


 

  

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the second

respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (including through
representatives), solicit, influence, entice or encourage any Transferred
Employee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to cease his or her employment
with Triangle or its Affiliates, as applicable, without the prior written
consent of Triangle; provided that the foregoing will not be deemed to
prohibit any Person or its Affiliates from engaging in general media
advertising or general employment solicitation that may be targeted to a
particular geographic or technical area but that is not targeted towards
Transferred Employees.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the restrictive provisions of this
_Section 7.3_ are material inducement for Triangle to enter into this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreement, (ii) Triangle would not enter into
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreement without such restrictive
provisions and (iii) such restrictive provisions are reasonable and necessary
and that Triangle will be irrevocably damaged if such covenants are not
specifically enforced. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees that, in
addition to any other relief or remedies available to Triangle, Triangle shall
be entitled to seek and obtain an appropriate injunction or other equitable
remedy from a court for the purposes of restraining a party hereto from any
actual or threatened breach of such covenants, and no bond or security will be
required in connection therewith. It is the desire of the parties hereto that
the restrictive provisions of this _Section 7.3_ be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under any applicable Law and public policies applied in
each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If a court declares that any
term or provision of _Section 7.3_ is invalid or unenforceable, the parties
hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to (and the parties hereto shall request
such court to) reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or enforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closes to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and _Section 7.3_ shall be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  


 

  

Section 7.4 _Matching Rights_. If any other Person (the " _Other Investor_ ")
who is or becomes a holder of Voting Securities was or is granted rights by
the Company as a shareholder of the Company (solely in such capacity) that are
(i) within the express scope of the rights granted to the Shareholder pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) more favorable to such shareholder than the rights
granted to the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall, if
the Other Investor owns or comes to own fewer Voting Securities than the
Shareholder, promptly cause this Agreement to be amended to cause the same
rights to be provided to the Shareholder. In determining whether an Other
Investor is granted rights more favorable than the rights granted to the
Shareholder under this Agreement, no account shall be taken of any
restrictions or obligations to which the Shareholder is subject under this
Agreement or to which such Other Investor agrees.

  


 

  

Section 7.5 _Tax Cooperation_. During the period beginning on the date hereof
and ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall act in accordance with Exhibit A.

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

TERM

  


 

  

Section 8.1 _Term_. This Agreement will be effective as of the date hereof
and, except as otherwise set forth herein, will continue in effect thereafter
until the earliest of (a) the date on which the Shareholder no longer
Beneficially Owns at least 7,829,167 Voting Securities (which number shall be
adjusted to reflect any consolidation, sub‑division, conversion or similar
event affecting the Voting Securities) or (b) its termination by the consent
of all parties hereto or their respective successors-in-interest.
Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the
provisions set forth in Article VI (Indemnification and Contribution), Article
IX (Miscellaneous) and in this Article VIII (Term) shall survive such
termination, and the provisions set forth in Article V (Registration Rights)
shall survive such termination until the first date on which there are no
Registrable Securities outstanding.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IX

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  


 

  

Section 9.1 _Injunctive Relief_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it would
be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that each other party shall, in
addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to
seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court
of competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or
defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement specifically
enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 9.2 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Company and by
the Shareholder and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and no
such term or provision is for the benefit of, or intended to create any
obligations to, any other Person, except (a) that the Persons indemnified
under Article VI are intended third party beneficiaries of Article VI, (b)
that Non-Liable Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 9.11
and (c) as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly provided for or permitted herein, neither this Agreement
nor any rights or obligations hereunder shall be assignable without the
consent of the other party.

  


 

  

Section 9.3 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by an agreement in writing executed by each of the parties
hereto. Either party hereto may waive in whole or in part any benefit or right
provided to it under this Agreement, such waiver being effective only if
contained in a writing executed by the waiving party. No failure by any party
hereto to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement
or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent
upon breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any
other covenant, duty, agreement or condition, nor shall any delay or omission
of either party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the
exercise of any such right accruing to it thereafter.

  

  

 

\- 30 -

other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

Section 9.5 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, to the
extent such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (such courts
collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or action relating to
this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Courts, (iv) agrees that
each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Courts, (v)
expressly and irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any action arising out of this Agreement
in the Delaware Courts or that any such action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (vi) consents to service of process
in the manner set forth in Section 9.4. Each of parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

Section 9.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several sections in
this Agreement are for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 9.7 _Integration_. This Agreement, the Transaction Agreement and the
other writings referred to herein and therein or delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto which form a part hereof or thereof contain the entire understanding
of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The
aforementioned agreements and writings supersede all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

  


 

  

Section 9.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible
in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each

shall constitute a legal and valid signature for purposes hereof and have the
same effect as an original), to the other parties hereto.

TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

  

  

 

\- 33 -  

  

Section 9.11 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, and notwithstanding the fact that any party hereto
may be a partnership or limited liability company, each party hereto, by its
acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the named parties hereto shall have
any obligation hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder
against, and no recourse hereunder or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith shall be had against, any
former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, manager,
assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, general
or limited partner, shareholder, member or employee of the Shareholder or the
Company (or any of their respective heirs, successors or permitted assigns),
or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent, employee,
Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative, general or limited partner, shareholder or member of any of
the foregoing Persons, but in each case not including the named parties hereto
(each, a " _Non-Liable Person_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) by or on behalf of such party against any Non-Liable Person, by the
enforcement of any assignment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law or otherwise; it
being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever
shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Liable
Person, as such, for any obligations of the applicable party under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or for any claim (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation), or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith.

  

  

Section 9.12 _No Adverse Actions_. Until such time as the Shareholder no
longer has the right to designate a Shareholder Nominee for nomination to the
Board pursuant to Section 3.4, without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder, except as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not take
any action to cause the amendment of its Constitution such that any of the
rights expressly provided to the Shareholder under this Agreement would be
adversely affected. Further, the Company undertakes that if it is redomiciled
following the date hereof, it will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the organizational documents of the redomiciled Company incorporate the
rights granted to the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement contained in
Section 3.4 (if operative at such time).

  

  

 

\- 34 -  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
