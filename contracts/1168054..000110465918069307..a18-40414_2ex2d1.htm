advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger and the
issuance of shares of common stock of Parent, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ ") pursuant to the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub 1 (the " _Merger Sub 1 Board_ ")

other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company agree as
follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** 
**CERTAIN DEFINITIONS**

 



 

1.1 _Certain Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the capitalized terms
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Annex A_ or as otherwise defined
elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _The First Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL (the " _First
Merger_ "). As a result of the First Merger, the separate existence of Merger
Sub 1 shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under the laws
of the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the
Company is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
At the Effective Time, the First Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
rights, immunities, and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub 1, of
a public as well as a private nature, and all debts and obligations due the
Company and Merger Sub 1, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred and
vested in the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible and liable for all of the liabilities and obligations of the
Company and Merger Sub 1.

 



 

2.2 _The Second Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Second Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the "
_LLC Act_ ") (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with the First Merger, the
" _Merger_ "). As a result of the Second Merger, the separate existence of the
Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub 2 shall continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving company (in
such capacity, Merger Sub 2 is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Company_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Second Merger Effective Time, all rights, immunities,
and franchises of each of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2, of a
public as well as a private nature, and all debts and obligations due the
Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2, shall be taken and deemed to be
transferred and vested in the Surviving Company,

 



     

 

 



 

and the Surviving Company shall be responsible and liable for all of the
liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2.

 



 

2.3 _Closing_.

 



 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place at 8:00
a.m., Mountain time, on a date that is two Business Days following the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver in
accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (excluding conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the continuing satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions as of the Closing) at the offices of Arnold and Porter
Kaye Scholer LLP in Denver, Colorado, or at such other time and place as
Parent and the Company may agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Closing Date_ " shall mean the date on which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(b) As early as practicable on the Closing Date, a certificate of merger
prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(the " _Certificate of First Merger_ ") shall be filed with the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The First Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of First Merger with the Office
of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as
shall be agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the
Certificate of First Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(c) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall cause a certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the LLC Act (the " _Certificate
of Second Merger_ ") to be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Second Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Second Merger with the Office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as shall be agreed upon
in writing by the Surviving Corporation and Parent and specified in the
Certificate of Second Merger (the " _Second Merger Effective Time_ "). At the
Second Merger Effective Time (i) each share of the Surviving Corporation
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto,
(ii) each share of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one share of Parent Series B Preferred Stock, and (iii)
the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub 2 outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company interests
of the Surviving Company. Without any action on the part of the holders of the
Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock, all outstanding certificates which
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time represented such shares
of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock and book-entry shares which
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time represented such shares
of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock shall, from and after the Second
Merger Effective Time, continue to represent a number of shares of Parent
Series B Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Preferred
Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time.

 



     

 

 



 

2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Company
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to be in the form set forth in _Annex D_ to this
Agreement, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or as
provided by applicable Law and (ii) subject to _Section 6.9(b)_ , the bylaws
of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of
Merger Sub 1 in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so
amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or as provided by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Second Merger Effective Time, (i) the certificate of formation of
Merger Sub 2 in effect immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided therein or as provided by applicable Law and
(ii) subject to _Section 6.9(b)_ , the limited liability company agreement of
Merger Sub 2 in effect immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company
until thereafter amended as provided therein or as provided by applicable Law.

 



 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company_.

 



 

(a) The directors and officers of Merger Sub 1 immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve until their
respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Parent shall take all actions necessary so that from and after the Second
Merger Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Company, to hold office until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company.

 



 

2.6 _Tax Consequences_. The parties intend that for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b) this Agreement, including any
amendment thereto, be and is hereby adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
involving the Merger for purposes of Section 354 and Section 361 of the Code.

EXCHANGE**

 



 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
1, the Company or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or the
Company:

 



     

 

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub 1_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
1 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III (including the
election procedures in _Section 3.3_ and the proration provisions in _Section
3.4_ ), each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares
and any Appraisal Shares, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
share of Company Restricted Stock, each Company Outperformance RSU and each
Company Option that has been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.2_ ), shall be converted into the
right to receive:

 



 

(A) _Mixed Election Shares_ : if a Mixed Election has been validly made with
respect to such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(b)(i)(A)_ and remains in effect at the Election Deadline, (1) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to $14.00 (the " _Mixed Election Cash Amount_ ")
and (2) 0.2366 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Mixed Election Exchange Ratio_ ") (subject to adjustment
in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ ) (such consideration, the " _Mixed
Election Consideration_ ");

 



 

(B) _Cash Election Shares_ : if a Cash Election has been validly made with
respect to such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(b)(i)(B)_ and remains in effect at the Election Deadline, an amount of
cash, without interest, equal to $35.00 (subject to adjustment in accordance
with _Section 3.1(c)_ ) (such consideration, the " _Cash Election
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
aggregate Cash Election Consideration payable in respect of the aggregate Cash
Election Shares would be greater than the Maximum Cash Election Consideration,
the proration provisions of _Section 3.4(a)_ shall apply; or

 



 

(C) _Stock Election Shares_ : if a Stock Election has been validly made with
respect to such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(b)(i)(C)_ and remains in effect at the Election Deadline, 0.3943 validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") (subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_
) (such consideration, the " _Stock Election Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that the aggregate Stock Election Consideration
payable in respect of the aggregate Stock Election Shares would be greater
than the Maximum Stock Election Consideration, the proration provisions of
_Section 3.4(b)_ shall apply.

 



      

 

 



 

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_ , shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each
holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Converted Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions
in accordance with _Section 3.5(g)_ , and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.5(h)_ , in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(iii) _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding from and after the Effective Time as one share of Surviving
Corporation Preferred Stock having the powers, preferences and rights
substantially similar to the Company Preferred Stock. Without any action on
the part of the holders of the Company Preferred Stock, all outstanding
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares of Company Preferred Stock and book-entry shares which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Company Preferred Stock
shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue to represent a number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares
of Company Preferred Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each such share, a " _Rolled Preferred Share_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, any holder of a share of Company Preferred Stock may
exercise its right to convert its shares of Company Preferred Stock into
Company Common Stock pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Certificate
of Designations prior to the Effective Time, and such holder may make an
Election with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock following such
conversion (subject to the election procedures in _Section 3.3_ and the
proration provisions in _Section 3.4_ ).

 



 

(iv) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares
or by Parent or Merger Sub 1 immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in
each case, not held on behalf of third parties (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of either the
Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub 1) (" _Converted Shares_ ") shall be
automatically converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (subject
to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ ).

 



 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. Without limiting the parties respective
obligations under _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ , in the event of any change
in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock (including
options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time by reason of
any stock split, reverse

 



     

 

 



 

stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Maximum Cash Election
Consideration, the Maximum Stock Election Consideration, the Mixed Election
Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio, the Mixed Election Cash Amount and the
Cash Election Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect
of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such
event, be used to calculate the Merger Consideration, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Rights Agreement_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all issued
and outstanding preferred share purchase rights of the Company issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement (the " _Company Rights_ ") will expire in their
entirety without any payment being made in respect thereof in accordance with
the Rights Agreement Amendment.

 



 

3.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted Cash Awards_.

 



 

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the election procedures and calculations in
_Section 3.3_ , and the proration provisions in _Section 3.4_ , shall apply
to, and take into account, each share of Company Restricted Stock, Company
Outperformance RSU and Company Option that is entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration as of the Effective Time, _provided_ that in all cases Company
SARs and Company Restricted Cash Awards shall be payable solely in cash.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
then outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock, whether subject to time-
based and/or performance-based vesting, shall automatically become fully
vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse (with any performance-based
vesting deemed satisfied at the maximum level), and, for the avoidance of
doubt, each holder thereof shall have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to such Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1_ (less required withholdings as provided in _Section 3.5(i)_ ) and to
submit an Election in accordance with the applicable procedures set forth in
_Section 3.3_.

 



 

(c) _Company Outperformance RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding Company Outperformance RSU shall, to the extent
unvested, automatically become fully vested (with the performance-based
vesting deemed satisfied at the maximum vesting level) and, in lieu of the
issuance of a share of Company Stock in respect of such Company Outperformance
RSU, shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (less required withholdings as provided in _Section
3.5(i)_ ). With respect to the form of Merger Consideration, each holder of an
outstanding Company Outperformance RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall have the right to submit an Election in accordance with
the applicable procedures set forth in _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(d) _Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Company Option shall, to the extent unvested, automatically become
fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the excess of (i) the
Merger Consideration _minus_ (ii) the applicable exercise price per share
under such Company Option (less required withholdings as provided in _Section
3.5(i)_ ). With respect to the form of Merger Consideration, each holder of an
outstanding

 



     

 

 



 

Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have the
right to submit an Election in accordance with the applicable procedures set
forth in _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(e) _Company SARs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Company SAR shall, to the extent unvested, automatically become
fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR immediately prior
to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess of (A) the Cash Election
Consideration _minus_ (B) the per share base price of such Company SAR (less
required withholdings as provided in _Section 3.5(i)_ ).

 



 

(f) _Company Restricted Cash Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding Company Restricted Cash Award shall, to the extent
unvested, automatically become fully vested. Each such Company Restricted Cash
Award shall be payable at the time set forth in the Company Equity Plan and
applicable award agreement.

 



 

(g) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall adopt resolutions
approving the treatment of the Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted
Cash Awards pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.2_ and, to the extent
that the Company Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
determines advisable in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the
extent applicable, the termination and liquidation of the Company Equity Plan
and any Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted Cash Awards thereunder.

 



 

3.3 _Company Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall prepare, and the Company shall file as an exhibit to the
Proxy Statement, a form of election (the " _Election Form_ ") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Election Form and such
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall
have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree) and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the later of the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "), the Company shall mail to each
registered holder of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Record Date
(including each holder of shares of Company Restricted Stock, Company
Outperformance RSUs and Company Options, but excluding any Cancelled Shares
and Converted Shares), the Election Form with the Proxy Statement (the "
_Election Form Mailing Date_ "). The Election Form shall be used by each
registered holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of
nominee holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to make a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election,
as applicable. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the
Election Form available to all persons who become registered holders of
Company Common Stock during the period between the Record Date and the
Election Deadline.

 



 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) of a share
of Company Common Stock (including each holder of shares of Company Restricted
Stock, Company

 



     

 

 



 

Outperformance RSUs and Company Options, but excluding any Cancelled Shares
and Converted Shares), subject to limitations set forth in this _Section
3.3(b)_ , to submit a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election, as
applicable (each an " _Election_ ") in accordance with the following
procedures:

 



 

(i) Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock may specify in a request
made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.3(b)_ (A) the number
of such holders shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such
holder elects to receive the Mixed Election Consideration (such Election with
respect to such number of shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Mixed
Election_ "), (B) the number of such holders shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Cash Election
Consideration (such Election with respect to such number of shares of Company
Common Stock, the " _Cash Election_ "), (C) the number of such holders shares
of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive
the Stock Election Consideration (such Election with respect to such number of
shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Stock Election_ "), and (D) the
particular shares for which such holder desires to make any such election, and
the order in which any such election is to apply to any such shares if the
election is subject to proration under _Section 3.4(b)_.

 



 

(ii) Any holder of a share of Company Common Stock who does not properly make
an Election in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ or whose
Election is not received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
in the manner provided in this _Section 3.3_ , will be deemed to have made the
Mixed Election with respect to each share of Company Common Stock for which a
valid Election has not been made or received in accordance with this _Section
3.3_.

 



 

(iii) Any Election will be deemed properly made only if the Exchange Agent has
received at its designated office, (A) by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) if the Closing Date is more than 10
Business Days after the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the date
that is seven Business Days preceding the Closing Date (in either case, the "
_Election Deadline_ "), an Election Form duly completed and validly executed
and accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock to which such Election Form relates (or customary affidavits and, if
required by the procedures set forth in the Election Form, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Election Form may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate). Parent and the Company shall publicly
announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least 10 Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date,
and Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when
determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

 



 

(c) After an Election is validly made with respect to any share of Company
Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares shall be
made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until such
Election is properly revoked in accordance with this _Section 3.3(c)_. Any
holder of a share of Company Common Stock may, at any time

 



     

 

 



 

prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke such holders Election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form. In
addition, all Elections shall automatically be revoked upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_. If an Election is revoked, the
holder of the Company Common Stock to which such Election previously applied
shall be deemed to have made the Mixed Election with respect to such Company
Common Stock unless and until a valid Election in respect of such Company
Common Stock is subsequently submitted to the Exchange Agent on or prior to
the Election Deadline in accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Certificates will
not be returned to the holder unless the holder so requests.

 



 

(d) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the determination of Parent,
in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination)
shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not a Mixed Election, a Cash
Election or a Stock Election has been properly made, changed or revoked
pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ and as to when Mixed Elections, Cash Elections
and Stock Elections, changes and revocations were received by the Exchange
Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make the following computations) shall also make all computations
contemplated by this _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ , and absent manifest
error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent
may, with the written consent of Parent, make any rules as are consistent with
this _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ for the implementation of Mixed
Elections, Cash Elections and Stock Elections as shall be necessary or
desirable to effect such elections in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

3.4 _Proration for Oversubscription_.

 



 

(a) _Proration for Oversubscription of Cash Election_. In the event that the
aggregate Cash Election Consideration payable in respect of the aggregate Cash
Election Shares would be greater than the Maximum Cash Election Consideration:

 



 

(i) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Mixed Election
has been made pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)(i)(A)_ (including any election made
with respect to Company Restricted Stock, Company Outperformance RSUs or
Company Options) and remains in effect at the Election Deadline and each share
of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Mixed Election has been deemed
to have been made pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.3_ (each, a "
_Mixed Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Mixed Election Consideration;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election
has been made pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)(i)(C)_ (including any election made
with respect to Company Restricted Stock, Company Outperformance RSUs or
Company Options) and remains in effect at the Election Deadline (each, a "
_Stock Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Election Consideration; and

 



 

(iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a
Cash Election has been made pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)(i)(B)_ (including any
election made with respect to Company Restricted Stock, Company Outperformance

 



     

 

 



 

RSUs or Company Options) and remains in effect at the Election Deadline (each,
a " _Cash Election Share_ ") that shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Election Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Maximum Cash Election Consideration and the
denominator of which is the aggregate Cash Election Consideration payable in
respect of the aggregate Cash Election Shares (prior to the conversion
contemplated by this _Section 3.4(a)(iii)_ ), with the remaining number of
Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Election Consideration.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances where this _Section 3.4(a)_
is applicable, each record holder of Cash Election Shares shall, to the extent
reasonably possible receive, the same proportion of Cash Election
Consideration, and the same proportion of Stock Election Consideration, with
respect to their aggregate Cash Election Shares as each other record holder of
Cash Election Shares receives in respect of their aggregate Cash Election
Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Proration for Oversubscription of Stock Election_. In the event that the
aggregate Stock Election Consideration payable in respect of the aggregate
Stock Election Shares would be greater than the Maximum Stock Election
Consideration:

 



 

(i) each Mixed Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Mixed Election Consideration;

 



 

(ii) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Election Consideration; and

 



 

(iii) the number of Stock Election Shares that shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Consideration shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Stock Election Shares by (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Maximum Stock Election Consideration
and the denominator of which is the aggregate Stock Election Consideration
payable in respect of the aggregate Stock Election Shares (prior to the
conversion contemplated by this _Section 3.4(b)(iii)_ ), with the remaining
number of Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Election Consideration.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances where this _Section 3.4(b)_
is applicable, each record holder of Stock Election Shares shall, to the
extent reasonably possible, receive the same proportion of Stock Election
Consideration, and the same proportion of Cash Election Consideration, with
respect to their aggregate Stock Election Shares as each other record holder
of Stock Election Shares receives in respect of their aggregate Stock Election
Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.4(b)_.

 



 

(c) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent (or Parent, in the event
that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computations), shall
make all computations to give effect to this _Section 3.4_.

 



     

 

 



 

3.5 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Election Form Mailing Date,
Parent shall enter into, or cause Merger Sub 1 to enter into, an agreement
with the Companys transfer agent, or another firm reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent, to act as agent for the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for purpose of
receiving and holding their Elections, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. On
the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for distribution in accordance with
this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, an amount in cash and a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting at least the amounts necessary
to satisfy the payment of the Merger Consideration and payment of cash in lieu
of fractional shares to the holders of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article III_. Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.5(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.5(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of
the Exchange Fund to the holders of Company Common Stock (after taking into
account all Company Common Stock then held by such holder and the Election(s)
made with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock by such holder).
Except as contemplated by this _Section 3.5(a)_ and _Sections 3.5(g)_ and
_3.5(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash
and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
as payment for fractional shares in accordance with _Section 3.5(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.5(g)_ ) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund._ " The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger
Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of (A) shares represented by a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Cancelled
Shares or Converted Shares and other than any holder of a Certificate or a
Book-Entry Share who properly made and did not revoke an Election pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ ) a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of
the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 3.1(b)(i)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share who properly made and did not revoke a Mixed
Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election pursuant to _Section 3.3_ shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Mixed Election
Consideration, the Cash Election Consideration or the Stock Election
Consideration, as applicable (subject to the proration provisions in _Section
3.4_ ), for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, (B) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)_ , and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_ , and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or
a Book-Entry Share who did not properly make an Election, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other customary documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent), shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (1) the Mixed Election Consideration for each
such share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, (2) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 3.5(g)_ , and (3) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 



 

(iii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a
condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by _Section 3.5(b)(ii)_ , each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (A)
the Mixed Election Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock, (B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 3.5(g)_ , and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.5(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.5(h))_ paid upon the surrender of and in exchange
for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation

 



     

 

 



 

(which, following the consummation of the Second Merger, shall include the
Surviving Company) for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other
than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock described in _Section 3.1(b)(iv)_ ), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)_ , without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th
day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)_ , in each case without interest
thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company,
Parent, the Merger Subs or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered
prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _Section
3.1(b)(iv)_ ) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)_.

 



 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to the whole shares of Parent

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in
each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.5_. Following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a subsequent payment date with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends
or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock
for the five consecutive trading days ending on the date that is two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), the Exchange Agent shall so
notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 



 

3.6 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal with

 



      

 

 



 

respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.1(b)(i)_ , but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the "fair value of
such shares" in accordance with Section 262 and at the Effective Time all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then (i) such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall
be forfeited and shall cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the
Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)(ii)_. The
Company shall serve prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company from a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 262, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
waive any failure by any holder of Company Common Stock to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by any such
holder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund
any material benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) increase in the
amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee or

financial point of view to such stockholders. Copies of such opinions will be

results of operations and the cash flows of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein.

 



 

(c) Parent has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by
others within those entities in connection with the reports it files under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed in any Parent SEC Documents are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and further designed and maintained to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external

material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting utilized by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) is not, and
since January 1, 2017 there has not been, any illegal act or fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries and (iii) is not, and since January 1, 2017 there has not been,
any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-

in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since September 30, 2018, there has not been any Parent Material Adverse
Effect or any event, change, effect or development that, individually or in

(b) From September 30, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, (i) Parent and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their business in the ordinary course of
business in all material respects, (ii) there has not been any material

covered by insurance, and (iii) none of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has undertaken any action that would require the consent of the Company
pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)(i)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ or _(vii)_.

 



 

5.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,

5.8 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
representation is made by Parent with respect to statements made therein based
on information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

 



 

5.9 _Parent Permits; Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Parent and its
Subsidiaries hold, and at all times since January 1, 2017 have held, all

Governmental Entities necessary to own, lease and operate their respective
properties and assets and for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses (the " _Parent Permits_ "), and have paid all fees and assessments

Parent Material Adverse Effect. The businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries
are currently being conducted, and at all times since January 1, 2017 have

other than those the outcome of which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.10 _Compensation; Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ " means all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not

supplemental retirement, retention, bonus, employment, change in control,
termination or severance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored or maintained by, or required to be
contributed to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any
current or former employee or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
excluding, in each case, any Multiemployer Plan. Each Parent Benefit Plan has
been established, operated and administered in accordance with its terms and

to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination, opinion
or advisory letter with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Parent Qualified
Plans_ ") and the related trust, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Parent Qualified Plan
or the related trust.

 



 

(c) No Parent Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. During the immediately preceding six
years, no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Parent or its ERISA
Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no condition exists that presents a material risk to Parent or its
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) None of the Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer

plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or
medical or life insurance benefits for any group of retired or former
employees or their beneficiaries or dependents, except as required by Section
4980B of the Code or similar state Law.

 



 

(f) All contributions required to be made to any Parent Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to

 



     

 

 



 

insurance policies funding any Parent Benefit Plan, for any period through the
date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Parent, except as, either individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(g) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted against (i) the Parent
Benefit Plans, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit Plans or (iii) the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit Plans, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
(i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, cause Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
material benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) increase in the amount
or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee or director
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) result in any limitation on the
right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Parent Benefit Plan or related trust.

 



 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state or local Law relating to Tax).

 



 

(j) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each
Parent Benefit Plan subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States (i) has been maintained in all respects in accordance with all
applicable requirements; (ii) that is intended to qualify for special Tax
treatment meet all requirements for such treatment; and (iii) that is intended
to be funded and/or book reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as
appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

of time for filing) by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete, and (B) all Taxes that are due and payable by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Taxes required to be withheld

for the assessment or payment of any Tax by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(iii) There is no outstanding claim, assessment or deficiency against Parent

deficiency for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance
with GAAP in the financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

(iv) There are no disputes, audits, examinations, investigations or
Proceedings pending or threatened in writing in respect of any Taxes or Tax
Returns of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither Parent nor any of

adequate reserves have been established, in accordance with GAAP in the
financial statements included in SEC Documents.

 



 

(v) There are no Encumbrances for Taxes on any property of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

(vi) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax
allocation, sharing or indemnity contract or arrangement (not including, for
the avoidance of doubt (A) any contract or arrangement solely among Parent
and/or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any customary Tax sharing or
indemnification provisions contained in any agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of business (e.g., leases, credit agreements or other
commercial agreements)). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has (x)
been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income

any of its Subsidiaries) or (y) any liability for Taxes of any Person (other
than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or as a transferee
or successor.

 



 

(vii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested, has received
or is subject to any written ruling of a Taxing Authority that will be binding
on it for any taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date or has
entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

 



 

(viii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated, or is
currently participating, in a "listed transaction" as defined in Treasury
Regulations § 1.6011-4(b)(2) (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock intended
to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two
years prior to the date of this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement, or (ii) as part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
Transactions.

 



 

(c) After reasonable diligence, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action,
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Merger Sub 2 is, and at the effective time of the Second Merger will be,
treated as a "disregarded entity" of Parent for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations and
warranties contained in this _Section 5.11_ , to the extent relating to Taxes
or Tax matters, _Section 5.5(b)_ , and, to the extent expressly referring to

Parent with respect to Taxes and Tax matters.

 



 

5.12 _Labor Matters_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, there are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, by or on behalf of any
applicant for employment, any current or former employee, current or former
independent contractor or any class of the foregoing, relating to any
applicable Laws respecting employment and employment or labor practices
(including all applicable Laws relating to wages, hours, child labor,
collective bargaining, employment discrimination, disability rights or
benefits, equal opportunity, plant closures and layoffs, civil rights,
classification of employees, classification of service providers as employees
and/or independent contractors, affirmative action, safety and health,
workers compensation, immigration, pay equity and the collection and payment
of withholding or social security), or alleging breach of any express or
implied contract of employment or service, wrongful termination of employment
or service, or alleging any other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct
in connection with the employment or service relationship.

 



 

5.13 _Litigation_. Except for such matters as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, there is no (a) Proceeding pending or threatened in
writing (or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened orally) against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Parent Oil and Gas Properties, or (b)
judgment, decree, injunction, ruling, writ, stipulation, determination, award
or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.14 _Intellectual Property_. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or have the
right to use all Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the operation
of the businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted (collectively, the " _Parent Intellectual Property_ ") free and
clear of all Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the
failure to own or have the right to use such properties has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Parent, the use of the Parent
Intellectual Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the
business of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted does
not infringe upon or misappropriate, or otherwise violate, any Intellectual
Property of any other Person, except for such matters that has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have,

 



     

 

 



 

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality
of trade secrets used in the businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as presently conducted, except where failure to do so has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.15 _Real Property_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and with respect to _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , except with respect to
any of Parents Oil and Gas Properties, (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
good, valid and defensible title to all material real property owned by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Owned Real Property_
") and valid leasehold estates in all material real property leased,
subleased, licensed or otherwise occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or
pursuant to other occupancy arrangements) by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent (collectively, including the improvements thereon, the " _Parent
Material Leased Real Property_ ") free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
Permitted Encumbrances, (b) each agreement under which Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant or
occupant with respect to the Parent Material Leased Real Property (each, a "
_Parent Material Real Property Lease_ ") to the knowledge of Parent is in full
force and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors
Rights, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, has received written notice of any default
under any Parent Material Real Property Lease, and (c) there does not exist
any pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings that affect any of Parents Oil and Gas Properties,
Parent Owned Real Property or Parent Material Leased Real Property.

 



 

5.16 _Rights-of-Way_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has such Rights-of-
Way as are sufficient to conduct its business in the manner described, and
subject to the limitations, qualifications, reservations and encumbrances
contained in any Parent SEC Document, except for such Rights-of-Way the
absence of which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all its material
obligations with respect to such Rights-of-Way and conduct their business in a
manner that does not violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has
occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation
or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations
and impairments that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
pipelines operated by Parent and its Subsidiaries are subject to Rights-of-
Way, and there are no gaps (including any gap arising as a result of any
breach by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way)
in the Rights-of-Way other than gaps that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.17 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the

 



     

 

 



 

ordinary course of business since the dates of the reserve report audited by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (in such capacity, the " _Parent Independent
Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the Parent interests referred to therein
as of December 31, 2017 (the " _Parent Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in
the Parent Reserve Report or in the Parent SEC Documents as having been sold
or otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report (the " _Parent Oil and
Gas Properties_ ") and in each case as attributable to interests owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for
Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and
defensible title" means that Parents or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing), beneficially
or of record, to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or
purported to be held or owned by them) that (A) entitles Parent (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest
share shown in the Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from
such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas
Properties, (B) obligates Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance
and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties,
of not greater than the working interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report
for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any increases that are accompanied
by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas
Properties) and (C) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

 



 

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or its Subsidiaries to the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to
the Parent interests referred to in the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the
time provided, accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from
reports that have been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers,
and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas
reserves of Parent at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with
SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change
in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases that are part of the
Parent Oil and Gas Properties (the " _Parent Oil and Gas Leases_ ") have been
properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Parent Oil and Gas
Properties have been timely and properly paid, (iii) none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (and, to the Parents knowledge, no third party operator) has
violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any

 



     

 

 



 

action that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute
a default under the provisions of any Parent Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the
lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Parent Oil and Gas Lease)
included in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties.

 



 

(d) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Parent Oil and Gas
Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely manner and
no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Parent Oil
and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or
individual) for any reason other than (i) as reported in the Parent SEC
Documents or (ii) awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries is
obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties and similar arrangements
established in the Oil and Gas Leases) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds
from the sale thereof, attributable to such Persons interest in its Oil and
Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at the
time of delivery, except, in each case, as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) All of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or other wells located on
the Oil and Gas Leases of Parent and its Subsidiaries or otherwise associated
with an Oil and Gas Property of Parent or its Subsidiaries have been drilled,
completed and operated within the limits permitted by the applicable contracts
entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries related to such wells and
applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and plugging and abandonment)
of such wells and all related development, production and other operations
have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law except, in each
case, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, none of
the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent or its Subsidiaries is subject to any
preferential purchase, consent, tag-along or similar right that would become
operative as a result of the Transactions.

 



 

(g) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parents knowledge, (a) there are no wells
that constitute a part of the Parent Oil and Gas Properties in respect of
which Parent has received a notice, claim, demand or order from any
Governmental Entity notifying, claiming, demanding or requiring that such
well(s) be temporarily or permanently plugged and abandoned; and (b) all wells
drilled by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are either (i) in use for
purposes of production, injection or water sourcing, (ii) suspended or
temporarily abandoned in accordance with applicable Law, or (iii) permanently
plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable Law.

from any off-site location where Hazardous Substances from Parents operations
have been sent for treatment, disposal storage or handling;

 



 

(iv) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has assumed, either expressly
or by operation of Law, any liability of any other Person related to Hazardous
Substances or Environmental Laws; and

to negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate), which negotiations may be on a nonexclusive basis with respect to
other negotiations or discussions permitted by this _Section 6.3_, to make
such adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that the Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal; and (2) at the end of the five Business Day period, prior
to taking action to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, the Company Board takes into
account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed
to by Parent in writing, and determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Competing
Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that in the event
of any change to the financial terms of, or any other material amendment or
material modification to, any Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to

 



     

 

 



 

comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(f)(iii)_ with respect to
such new written notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set
forth in this _Section 6.3(f)(iii)_ shall be reduced to two Business Days;
and

 



 

(iv) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, seek
clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-public
information to) any Person that has made a Company Competing Proposal solely
to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide
adequate information for the Company Board or any committee thereof to make an
informed determination under this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement, the
Company may, if the Company Board so chooses, effect a Company Change of
Recommendation if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have given five
Business Days prior notice to Parent that the Company has determined that a
Company Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which notice will reasonably
describe such Company Intervening Event) and that the Company intends to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation, and (1) after giving such notice
and prior to effecting such Company Change of Recommendation, the Company
negotiates (and causes its officers, employees, financial advisors and outside
legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and (2) at the end of
the five Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company Board takes into account any adjustments
or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and
any other information offered by Parent in response to the notice, and
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material changes regarding any Company
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(g)_
with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance written
notice obligation set forth in _Section 6.3(g)_ shall be reduced to three
Business Days.

 



 

6.4 _Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 



 

(a) Parent and the Company will promptly furnish to the other party such data
and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including, in Parents case,
the Merger Subs) and the holders of its capital stock, as the Company or
Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request for the purpose of including
such data and information in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, and, in each case, any amendments or supplements thereto.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, (i) the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in preparing, and the Company shall cause to be filed with the SEC
as promptly as practicable, a mutually acceptable Proxy Statement relating to
the matters to be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included,
in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the First Merger. The Company and Parent shall
each use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon
after such filing as reasonably practicable and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the First Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will
advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional
information, and Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare any response to
such comments or requests, and each of the Company and Parent agrees to permit
the other (in each case, to the extent practicable), and their respective
outside counsels, to participate in all meetings and conferences with the SEC.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (A) provide the other
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response),
(B) include in such document or response all comments reasonably and promptly
proposed by the other and (C) not file or mail such document or respond to the
SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each
party shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of
the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 



 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the

 



     

 

 



 

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

6.5 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC. Except as
expressly permitted by _Section 6.3_, the Company Board shall recommend that
the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board shall
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement, and the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Company Board has made the Company Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement that is required to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Law is provided to the Companys stockholders or (B) if, as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that a proxy related to the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to a Voting Agreement shall be deemed
to have been received by the Company for such purpose; and (ii) may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably determines
in good faith that there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was
previously scheduled (it being understood that such Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described
in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist, and such Company
Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided_
, _further_ , that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date on or after two Business Days prior to the End Date. The
Company shall promptly provide all voting tabulation reports relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the
Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative and shall
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written
communications from or to the Companys stockholders with respect thereto.
Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation as expressly
permitted by _Section 6.3_, the parties agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Companys
stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Stockholder Approval
from being obtained.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company agrees
that (i) its obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not be affected by
the making of a Company Change of Recommendation and (ii) its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company of any Company
Competing Proposal or other proposal (including, a Company Superior Proposal)
or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby acknowledges that pursuant to the Voting Agreements,
the stockholders of the Company party thereto have appointed and constituted
Parent (subject to Section 4 of the applicable Voting Agreement) as such
stockholders true and lawful attorney-in-fact and proxy (which proxy is
irrevocable and which appointment is coupled with an interest, including for
purposes of Section 212 of the DGCL), to the fullest extent of such
stockholders rights with respect to the Subject Securities (as defined in the
applicable Voting Agreement) beneficially owned by such stockholder, to vote
such Subject Securities at the Company Stockholders Meeting, solely on the
matters and in the manner specified in the Voting Agreement (the "
_Stockholder Proxy_ "). The Company further agrees that, from and after the
date hereof until the Expiration Time (as defined in the applicable Voting
Agreement), it shall recognize the grant of the Stockholder Proxy and the
exercise thereof by Parent in accordance with its terms at any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company (including the Company Stockholders Meeting and
any adjournment or postponement thereof), subject to applicable Law.

 



 

6.6 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this _Section 6.6_,
the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. Each party shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its Representatives, during
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, reasonable access, at reasonable
times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries
and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other
party and its Representatives such information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be
reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the other party.
Each party and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
other party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the
other party and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6(a)_, neither party shall be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to the other party or any of its Representatives to the extent
that such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the

 



      

 

 



 

attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such
information is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or
agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does
not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither party shall have access to personnel records of the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the other
partys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither party shall be permitted to conduct any sampling or
analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of
the other party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
other party, which may be granted or withheld in such other partys sole
discretion. Each party agrees that (i) no investigation or information
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 herein and (ii) it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ for
any purpose unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 

(b) The Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of September 10, 2018, between
Parent and the Company (as amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All
information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as
defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

(b) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws
to which _Section 6.7(c)_, _Section 6.7(d)_ and _Section 6.7(e)_, and not
this _Section 6.7(b)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all authorizations, consents, notifications,
certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in
order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters. Neither Party nor its Subsidiaries shall agree to any actions,
restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods or
authorizations in connection with the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than 15 Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, the

 



     

 

 



 

parties shall make any filings required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate
fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust
Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity charged with
enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any Antitrust Law,
including the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States,
or any other competition authority of any other jurisdiction (" _Antitrust
Authority_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, in connection with the efforts referenced in this
_Section 6.7_, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (ii) promptly notify the other party of any communication
concerning this Agreement or any of the Transactions to that party from or
with any Governmental Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the
consent of such person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, and consider in good faith the views of the other party
and keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of matters related
to the Transactions, including furnishing the other party with any written
notices or other communications received by such party from, or given by such
party to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the Transactions, except that any materials concerning one partys
valuation of the other party may be redacted; and (iii) permit the other party
to review in draft any proposed communication to be submitted by it to any
Governmental Entity with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and
consult with each other in advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the
applicable Governmental Entity or Person, not participate in any meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings or
investigations concerning this Agreement or any of the Transactions unless it
consults with the other party and its Representatives in advance and invites
the other partys Representatives to attend in accordance with applicable
Laws. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to preserve the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege with respect to any information shared pursuant to this _Section
6.7(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take any and
all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise
disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose
of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv)
creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change
or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries
and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an
order or decree or file appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority
in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their

 



     

 

 



 

businesses or assets (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no
Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling,
injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, none of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take any Divestiture
Action or other action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, an adverse effect on the business, financial conditions
or operations of Parent and the Company on a combined basis, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Merger which effect would be a material adverse
effect relative to a company that is of a size and scope substantially similar
to the Company, taken as a whole. The Company shall not be required to take
any Divestiture Action requested by Parent unless such action is only
effective after the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of
the Transactions.

 



 

(e) In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the
Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action,
including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or
resolve such action (provided, that in no event shall this _Section 6.7(e)_
require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an adverse
effect on the business, financial conditions or operations of Parent and the
Company on a combined basis, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger which effect would be a material adverse effect relative to a company
that is of a size and scope substantially similar to the Company, taken as a
whole). Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.7_, including the immediately
foregoing sentence, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction
or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in
any Proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the End Date.

 



 

(f) Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall not take any action
that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay obtaining the clearance,
or the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, under the
HSR Act.

 



 

6.8 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to, employ each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) as of the
Effective Time and to provide to each such employee the base salary or wages
and annual target cash bonus opportunity in effect as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the forgoing, nothing herein shall, after
the Effective Time, impose on Parent or its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any obligation to retain any employee for
any amount of time or on any terms and conditions of employment.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to Closing become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company or
one of its Subsidiaries to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the analogous the Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the
Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective
Time.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates any right to continue in
the employ or service of the Surviving Company, or any Affiliate thereof, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Company, Parent or any Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Company) or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time except in any manner adverse to the relevant employees,
such plan or any severance provision therein. Without limiting the generality
of the final sentence of _Section 9.6_, nothing in this _Section 6.8_,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including
any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any
of its Affiliates, any third party beneficiary or other right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on
the date hereof or otherwise (which shall be assumed by Parent and the
Surviving Company), from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the

 



     

 

 



 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Company Benefit Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise (the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and
expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of
or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which
such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan
or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done
or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act
or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Company shall,
jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and in accordance with the procedures
(if any) set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company; provided, that such Covered Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

 



 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Company shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company
or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would)
adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement
or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of its directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
this _Section 6.9_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons
rights under this _Section 6.9_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract
regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company will cause to be put in place, and Parent shall
fully prepay immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the
Effective Time,

least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with

opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such public
announcement or statement in advance and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable changes suggested thereto); _provided_ , that each party may issue

ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from the Takeover Laws of
any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions.

as a basis for not consummating the Merger or for terminating this Agreement,
on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
primarily caused by such partys breach in any material respect of any
covenant of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained
(except as expressly set forth below):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 



 

(i) if any Governmental Entity of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over any party shall have issued any order, decree, ruling
or injunction or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such order, decree,
ruling or injunction or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable, or if there shall be adopted after the date of this Agreement
any Law that permanently makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
permanently prohibited; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
party whose violation or breach of any material covenant or agreement under
this Agreement has been the primary cause of or resulted in the action or
event described in this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ occurring;

 



 

(ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before 5:00 p.m.
Mountain time, on July 18, 2019; _provided_ that if on such date the condition
to closing set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ (if the failure
of such condition to be then satisfied is due to an Antitrust Law) shall not
have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall have been
satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied or waived by all
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions), such date may be extended
by Parent or the Company from time to time by written notice to the other
party up to a date that is no later than October 18, 2019 (the " _End Date
Extension_ ", and such date, as it may be extended by the End Date Extension,
the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party
whose violation or breach of any material covenant or agreement under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to occur on or before such date;

 



 

(iii) in the event of a breach by the other party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_
or _7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ , as applicable, if it was
continuing as of the Closing Date and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by
the earlier of (i) forty-five days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching party of such breach and the basis for such notice, and (ii) two
Business Days prior to the End Date (a " _Terminable Breach_ "); _provided_ ,
that the terminating party is not then in Terminable Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement; or

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a
vote held at a duly held Company Stockholders Meeting, or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

 



 

(c) by Parent, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
if the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Company
Change of Recommendation;

 



 

(d) by the Company, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, in accordance with _Section 6.3(f)(iii)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall have contemporaneously with such termination paid or
caused to be paid to Parent of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_;

 



 

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination, and
any termination shall be effective immediately upon delivery of such written
notice to the other party ( _provided_ , that the terminating party has
complied with the other notice requirements set forth in _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ or paid the fee required by _Section 8.1(d)_, to the extent
applicable).

 



 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party as provided in
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of any party, except with respect to
this _Section 8.2_, _Section 6.6(b)_, _Section 8.3_ and _Articles I_ and
_IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any
damages (including, in the case of the Company, damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the stockholders of
the Company, which shall be deemed to be damages of the Company) for a Willful
and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder or
intentional and knowing fraud.

 



 

8.3 _Expenses and Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party shall pay its
own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, whether or not the Merger
shall be consummated.

 



 

(b) If (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_
(Company Change of Recommendation) or (ii) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ (Company Superior Proposal), then the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent. If the fee shall be payable pursuant to _clause (i)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence, the fee shall be paid no later than three
Business Days after notice of termination of this Agreement, and if the fee
shall be payable pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of the immediately preceding
sentence, the fee shall be paid contemporaneously with such termination of
this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) If (i) (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (Failure to Obtain Company Stockholder Approval) or (B)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (Company
Terminable Breach) and the breach giving rise to such termination was a
Willful and Material Breach by the Company of a covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement (provided, that solely for purposes of this
_Section 8.3(c)_, the word "may" in the definition of Willful and Material
Breach shall be replaced with the word "would"), (ii) on or before the date of
any such termination a Company Competing Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or disclosed prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (iii)
within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company Competing
Proposal or consummates any transaction meeting the parameters of a Company
Competing Proposal, then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent
the Company Termination Fee (less any amounts previously paid by the Company
to Parent in accordance with _Section 8.3(d)_), in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent, on the
earliest date of when such definitive agreement is executed or such
transaction is consummated. For purposes of this _Section 8.3(c)_, any
reference in the definition of Company Competing Proposal to "twenty five
percent (25%)" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than eighty percent
(80%)".

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iv)_ (Failure to Obtain Company Stockholder Approval), then the Company
shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the amount of the Parent Expenses, in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent within two Business Days of such termination.

 



 

(e) In the event that a terminating party has the right to terminate pursuant
multiple provisions of _Section 8.1_, such terminating party may elect which
provision pursuant to which it is terminating this Agreement. The parties
agree that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral
part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to promptly pay to
Parent the amount due by it pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, interest shall
accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at the prime
rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. If, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences
a Proceeding that results in judgment for Parent for such amount, the Company
shall pay to Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
Proceeding. The parties agree that the monetary remedies set forth in _Section
8.1(d)_ and this _Section 8.3_ and the specific performance remedies set
forth in _Section 9.10_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and
any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of
intentional and knowing fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only Parent shall be liable
for damages for such intentional and knowing fraud or Willful and Material
Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates shall have any further liability or

 



     

 

 



 

obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
except for the liability of Parent in the case of intentional and knowing
fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation; and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 against the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
directors, officers, stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in
the case of intentional and knowing fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of
any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be
liable for damages for such intentional and knowing fraud or Willful and
Material Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future directors,
officers, stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, except for the liability of the Company in the case of
intentional and knowing fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation.

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against
any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or
warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the
presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto, and for purposes of
_Schedule 6.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, any item disclosed in
response to any subclause of _Schedule 6.1_ shall be deemed to be disclosed in
response to each other subclause of _Schedule 6.1_ to the extent that the
relevance of such item to such subclause is reasonably apparent.

 



 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, to the extent
applicable, refer to the corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless
expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the
language contained therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited.
The words "this Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import, refer
only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word
"including" (in its various forms) means "including, without limitation."
Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state
and include any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms
defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural
and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include
the singular and plural and

 



     

 

 



 

the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to
Mountain time. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The term "dollars" and the symbol "$" mean United States
Dollars. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(e) In this Agreement, except as the context may otherwise require, references
to: (i) any agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute or
regulation are to the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in the case of
an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof and, if
applicable, by the terms of this Agreement); (ii) any Governmental Entity
includes any successor to that Governmental Entity; (iii) any applicable Law
refers to such applicable Law as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced
from time to time (and, in the case of statutes, include any rules and
regulations promulgated under such statute) and references to any section of
any applicable Law or other law include any successor to such section; (iv)
"days" mean calendar days; and (v) when calculating the period of time within
which, or following which, any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to
this Agreement, the date that is the reference day in calculating such period
shall be excluded (e.g., if an act must be completed within two days of an
event, if such event occurs on a Tuesday, then such act must be completed by
the end of the day on Thursday) and if the last day of the period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next Business Day or if
any action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day,
then such action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business
Day.

 



 

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including via electronic means (such as Docusign, Adobe Sign,
photocopy or scan of an original signature, or otherwise), all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



 

9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (together
with the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and any other
documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto constitute the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
for the provisions of _Article III_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the rights of the former holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or Company Equity Awards to receive the Merger Consideration), _Section
6.9_ (which from and after the Effective Time are intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Persons referred to therein and by their
respective heirs and representatives), nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Parents,
Merger Sub 1s or Merger Sub 2s Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement
or intentional and knowing fraud, then the Companys stockholders, acting
solely through the

 



     

 

 



 

Company, shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be entitled to
pursue any and all legally available remedies, including equitable relief, and
to seek recovery of all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of
every kind and nature, including reasonable attorneys fees; provided,
however, that the rights granted pursuant to this sentence shall be
enforceable only by the Company, on behalf of the Company stockholders, in the
Companys sole discretion, it being understood and agreed such rights shall
attach to such shares of Company Stock and subsequently trade and transfer
therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements, or other amounts
recovered or received by the Company with respect to such rights may, in the
Companys sole discretion, be (a) distributed, in whole or in part, by the
Company to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any
date determined by the Company or (b) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company
deems fit.

 



 

9.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR
TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

 



 

(b) THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF
CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR, IF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE OR THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT DETERMINES THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING
SECTION 111 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, THE COURT
OF CHANCERY DOES NOT HAVE OR SHOULD NOT EXERCISE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
OVER SUCH MATTER, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL
COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SOLELY
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE THAT ARISES IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED
TO IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND
AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR
INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IT IS NOT
SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR
IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE
APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN
OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY
CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH
PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF
PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 9.3_ OR IN SUCH

 



     

 

 



 

OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE
THEREOF.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

 



 

9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 



 

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of
this _Section 9.9_ shall be void.

 



 

9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent

 



     

 

 



 

breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 9.10_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or
in equity. Each party accordingly agrees (a) the non-breaching party will be
entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of actual
damages; (b) the breaching party will not raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement and will not
plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at Law; and
(c) the breaching party agrees to waive any requirement that the non-breaching
party obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section
9.10_, all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.10_. If prior to
the End Date, any party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End
Date shall automatically be extended by such other time period established by
the court presiding over such action.

 



 

9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law would require
the further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 



 

9.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, to the extent legally permitted: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party hereunder;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an

Agreement and the compliance by Company Stockholder with any provisions hereof
do not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
Company Stockholder, or (ii) result in any breach of or constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)

or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby.

 



 

 **10. _Miscellaneous_**.

 



 

 **10.1 _Severability_**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to

 



     

 

 



 

delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,
the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

 

 ** **

 

 **10.2 _Assignment_**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this _Section 10.2_ shall be void and shall not be deemed to
prevent Parent from engaging in any merger, consolidation or other business
combination transaction.

 



 

 **10.3 _Amendments and Modifications_**. No provision of this Agreement may
be amended or modified unless such amendment or modification is in writing and
signed by (a) Parent, and (b) Company Stockholder. No failure or delay by any
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law.

 



 

 **10.4 _Notices_**. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party under, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement shall be in

determined exclusively by such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such Parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that

monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Parties. Prior to

agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or

in equity.

of the Merger Agreement.

is entered into by and among Cimarex Energy Co., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and the undersigned signatories set forth on the signature pages
hereto under the heading "Company Stockholders" (collectively, the " _Company
Stockholders_ "). Parent and the Company Stockholders are each sometimes
referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_." Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 



 

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , each of the Company Stockholders is the beneficial or record
owners and has either sole voting power or shared voting power together with
the other Company Stockholders over, such number of shares of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), of Resolute
Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as is
indicated opposite Company Stockholders name on _Schedule A_ attached hereto;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, CR Sub 1 Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), CR Sub 2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub 2_ " and,
together with Merger Sub 1, the " _Merger Subs_ "), and the Company are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time,
the " _Merger Agreement_ ") that provides, among other things, for (i) the
merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the Company, with the Company being the
surviving entity (the " _First Merger_ ") and, immediately thereafter, the
merger of the surviving entity of the First Merger with and into Merger Sub 2,
with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity of such second merger (the "
_Second Merger_ " and, collectively with the First Merger, the " _Merger_ "),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition and an inducement to Parents willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that each Company
Stockholder agree, and Company Stockholder has agreed, to enter into this
Agreement with respect to all Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock that Company Stockholder Beneficially Owns (including those owned of
record);

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition and an inducement to Parents willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that certain other
company stockholders (" _Other Company Stockholders_ ") agree, and Other
Company Stockholders have agreed to, enter into substantially similar voting
and support agreements with respect to all Company Common Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock that such Other Company Stockholders Beneficially Own
(including those owned of record);

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , prior to the date hereof, the Company Board approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby for purposes of Section 203
of the DGCL; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent desires that the Company Stockholders agree, and the
Company Stockholders are willing to agree, subject to the limitations herein,
not to Transfer (as defined below) any of their Subject Securities (as defined
below), and to vote their Subject Securities in a manner so as to facilitate
consummation of the Merger.

 



     

 

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, do hereby
agree as follows:

tenses, cases and correlative forms shall have the meanings assigned to them
in this _Section 1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



 

" _Beneficially Own_ " or " _Beneficial Ownership_ " has the meaning assigned
to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, and Company Stockholders
beneficial ownership of securities shall be calculated in accordance with the
provisions of such Rule (in each case, irrespective of whether or not such
Rule is actually applicable in such circumstance). For the avoidance of doubt,
Beneficially Own and Beneficial Ownership shall also include record ownership
of securities.

 



 

" _Beneficial Owners_ " shall mean Persons who Beneficially Own the referenced
securities.

 



 

" _control_ " (including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlled by"

" _Expiration Time_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (a) the receipt of
Company Stockholder Approval; (b) the date of any amendment, waiver or
modification of the Merger Agreement without the Company Stockholders prior
written consent that has the effect of (1) decreasing the Merger

payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement in
effect on the date of this Agreement or (3) otherwise affecting the Company
Stockholders in a materially adverse manner; (c) such date and time as the
Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof; or (d)
the termination of this Agreement by mutual written consent of the Parties.

 



 

" _Permitted Transfer_ " shall mean, in each case, with respect to each
Company Stockholder, so long as (a) such Transfer is in accordance with
applicable Law and (b) such Company Stockholder is, and at all times has been,
in compliance with this Agreement, (A) any Transfer of Subject Securities by
Company Stockholder to an Other Company Stockholder or to any Person, so long
as such Person, in connection with, and prior to, such Transfer, executes a
joinder to this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_,
pursuant to which such Person agrees to become a party to this Agreement and
be subject to the restrictions and obligations applicable to such Company
Stockholder and otherwise become a party for all purposes of this Agreement
(the " _Joinder_ "), (B) any Transfer of Subject Securities (i) as a bona fide
gift or gifts, (ii) by will, other testamentary document or intestate
succession to the legal representative, heir, beneficiary or a member of the
immediate family of Company Stockholder or (iii) by operation of law, such as
pursuant to a qualified domestic order or as required by a divorce settlement,
in each case, so long as such transferee executes a Joinder, or (C) any
Transfer of Subject Securities in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and as expressly provided for in the Merger Agreement; _provided_ that
no such Transfer shall relieve Company Stockholder from its obligations under
this Agreement, other than with respect to the Company Common Stock
transferred in accordance with the foregoing provision.

 



     

 

 



 

" _Subject Securities_ " shall mean shares of Company Common Stock, New
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock.

 



 

" _Transfer_ " means any direct or indirect offer, sale, lease, assignment,
encumbrance, loan, pledge, grant of a security interest, hypothecation,
disposition or other transfer (by operation of law or otherwise), either
voluntary or involuntary, or entry into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to any offer, sale, lease,
assignment, encumbrance, loan, pledge, hypothecation, disposition or other
transfer (by operation of law or otherwise), of any capital stock or interest
in any capital stock (or any security convertible or exchangeable into such
capital stock), including in each case through the Transfer of any Person or
any interest in any Person; provided, that any transaction shall not
constitute a Transfer so long as such transaction does not in any way limit
the ability of such Company Stockholder to vote its Subject Securities in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"capital stock" shall include interests in a partnership or limited liability
company.

 



 

 **2. _Agreement to Retain Subject Securities_**.

 



 

 **2.1 _Transfer and Encumbrance of Subject Securities_**. Other than a
Permitted Transfer, hereafter until the Expiration Time, no Company
Stockholder shall, with respect to any Subject Securities Beneficially Owned
by such Company Stockholder, (a) Transfer any such Subject Securities, or (b)
deposit any such Subject Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to such Subject Securities or grant any
proxy (except as otherwise provided herein) or power of attorney with respect
thereto.

 



 

 **2.2 _Injunction_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the
Expiration Time a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction enters an
order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Company Stockholders
or their Affiliates from (a) consummating the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or (b) taking any action pursuant to _Section 3_ or _Section
4_, then (i) the obligations of each Company Stockholder set forth in _Section
3_ and the irrevocable proxy and power of attorney in _Section 4_ shall be of
no force and effect for so long as such order is in effect and, in the case of
clause (b), solely to the extent such order restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits such Company Stockholder from taking any such action, and (ii) each
Company Stockholder shall cause the Subject Securities to not be represented
in person or by proxy at any meeting at which a vote of such Company
Stockholder on the Merger is requested. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 2.2_, the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.1_
shall continue to apply with respect to the Subject Securities until the
Expiration Time.

 



 

 **2.3 _Additional Purchases; Adjustments_**. Each Company Stockholder agrees
that any shares of Company Common Stock and any other shares of capital stock
or other equity that Company Stockholder acquires Beneficial Ownership of
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Time (the "
_New Company Common Stock_ ") shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to the same extent as and shall constitute Company Common
Stock, and such Company Stockholder shall promptly notify Parent of the
existence of any New Company Common Stock. In the event of any stock split,
stock dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or the like of the capital stock of the
Company affecting the Subject Securities, the terms of this Agreement shall
apply to the resulting securities.

 



     

 

 



 

 **2.4. _Unpermitted Transfers; Involuntary Transfers_**. Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer of any Subject Securities in violation of this _Section 2_
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be null and void _ab initio_.
If any involuntary Transfer of any of such Company Stockholders Subject
Securities shall occur, the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall
include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial
transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Securities subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until valid termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **3. _Agreement to Vote and Approve_**. From and after the date hereof until
the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company
called with respect to any of the following matters, and at every adjournment
or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of
the stockholders of the Company with respect to any of the following matters,
each Company Stockholder shall, and shall cause each holder of record of
Subject Securities on any applicable record date to (including via proxy),
vote the Subject Securities: (a) in favor of (i) the approval of the Merger
and adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or
postpone such meeting of stockholders of the Company to a later date if there
are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement
and (b) against (i) any action or agreement that would result in any condition
to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VII of the Merger
Agreement not being fulfilled, (ii) any Company Competing Proposal, (iii) any
action which would materially delay, materially postpone or materially
adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, or dilute, in any material respect,
the benefit of the transactions contemplated thereby to Parent or to Parents
stockholders, and (iv) any action which would result in a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Merger
Agreement; provided, that in the case of each of clause (a) and (b) above, the
Merger Agreement shall not have been amended or modified without the Company
Stockholders consent (1) to decrease the Merger Consideration, (2) to change
the form of Merger Consideration, in each case, payable to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement or (3) otherwise affecting the Company Stockholders in a materially
adverse manner, provided further, that in the event the Company has effected
(and not withdrawn) a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company
Stockholders shall be released from their obligations under this _Section 3_.

 



 

 **4. _Irrevocable Proxy_**. Each Company Stockholder hereby revokes any and
all previous proxies granted with respect to such Company Stockholders
Subject Securities. By execution of this Agreement, each Company Stockholder
hereby appoints and constitutes Parent, until the Expiration Time (at which
time this proxy shall automatically be revoked), with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, as such Company Stockholders true and lawful
attorney-in-fact and proxy (which proxy is irrevocable and which appointment
is coupled with an interest, including for purposes of Section 212 of the
DGCL), to the fullest extent of such Company Stockholders rights with respect
to the Subject Securities Beneficially Owned by such Company Stockholder, to
vote such Subject Securities solely with respect to the matters set forth in
_Section 3_ hereof and each Company Stockholder shall retain the authority to
vote its Subject Securities in its discretion on all other matters with no
power granted to Parent in respect of such other matters; _provided_ ,
however, that the foregoing shall only be effective if (i) such Company
Stockholder fails to be counted as present, to consent or to vote such Subject
Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the Company
Stockholders have not been released from their obligations under _Section 3_
of this Agreement pursuant to the final proviso thereof. The Company
Stockholders and Parent (or its substitute hereunder) shall have the right to
vote the Subject Securities in accordance with this Agreement on the matters
set forth in _Section 3_ and the Company Stockholders shall be obligated to
so vote the Subject Securities.

authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement and to
grant the irrevocable proxy as set forth in _Section 4_ hereof. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Company
Stockholder and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such Company Stockholder
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that

exist pursuant to securities laws, Encumbrances under such Company
Stockholders Organizational Documents or customary Encumbrances pursuant to
the terms of any custody or similar agreement applicable to shares of Company
Common Stock held in brokerage accounts that in each case would not reasonably
be expected to (x) impair in any material respect the ability of such Company
Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule B1_ , and, (b)
except as set forth on _Schedule B2_ , has sole voting power or shared voting
power over all of the shares of Subject Securities Beneficially Owned by such

 **5.3 _No Conflict; Consents_**.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Company Stockholder
does not, and the performance by such Company Stockholder of the obligations
under this Agreement and the compliance by such Company Stockholder with any
provisions hereof do not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to such Company Stockholder, or (ii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Encumbrance on any of the shares of Subject Securities Beneficially Owned by
such Company Stockholder pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which such Company Stockholder is a party or by which such
Company Stockholder is bound which would materially adversely affect such
Company Stockholders ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person, is
required by or with respect to such Company Stockholder in connection with the

the Merger Agreement, (3) those Consents which have already been obtained or
made and (4) any Consents that, if not obtained, made or given, individually

obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially impede or delay
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.4 _Absence of Litigation_**. There is no Proceeding pending against, or,
to the knowledge of such Company Stockholder, threatened against or affecting,

Company Stockholder does not Beneficially Own any shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

 **6. _Termination_**. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no
further force or effect immediately as of and following the Expiration Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any party from liability for breach of this Agreement and (b) Section
10 (other than (x) the second and third sentences of Section 10.15 and (y)
Section 10.16) shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7. _Notice of Certain Events_**. Each Company Stockholder shall notify
Parent in writing promptly of (a) any fact, event or circumstance that would
cause or constitute, a breach in any material respect of the representations
and warranties of that Company Stockholder under this Agreement and (b) the
receipt by that Company Stockholder of any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available to any party.

 



 

 **8. _No Solicitation_. **Each Company Stockholder will not, and will not
authorize or permit its controlled Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, employees and officers to, and will not authorize or permit its
Representatives to, and will not announce any intention to, directly or
indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of a
Company Competing Proposal, (b) engage in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to a Company Competing Proposal, (c) furnish any non-

of intent or agreement in principle, or other agreement or commitment in
respect of any proposal or offer that constitutes a Company Competing Proposal
or (e) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the actions referred

contrary, the Company Stockholders, directly or indirectly through one or more
of their Representatives, may engage in the actions referred to in clauses (a)
\- (d) of this Section 8 with any Person if the Company is permitted to engage
in such actions with such Person pursuant to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement, in each case subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth
in Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

 **9. _Waiver of Certain Actions_**.

 



 

(a) Each Company Stockholder hereby waives, and agrees not to exercise, any
rights of appraisal or rights of dissent from the Merger that such Company
Stockholder may have with respect to the Subject Securities.

 



 

(b) Each Company Stockholder hereby agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or successors (i) challenging
the validity of, or seeking to enjoin or delay the operation of, any provision
of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (including any claim seeking to
enjoin or delay the Closing) or (ii) alleging a breach of any duty of the
Company Board or Parent Board in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby.

 



 

 **10. _Miscellaneous_**.

 



 

 **10.1 _Severability_**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,
the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

 



 

 **10.2 _Assignment_**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this _Section 10.2_ shall be void and shall not be deemed to
prevent Parent from engaging in any merger, consolidation or other business
combination transaction.

 



 

 **10.3 _Amendments and Modifications_**. No provision of this Agreement may
be amended or modified unless such amendment or modification is in writing and
signed by (a) Parent, and (b) each Company Stockholder. No failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable
Law.

 



 

 **10.4 _Notices_**. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party under, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) if delivered in

 **10.5 _Governing Law_**. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

 



     

 

 



 

 **10.6 _Submission to Jurisdiction_**. The Parties irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the Delaware Supreme Court
determines that, notwithstanding Section 111 of the DGCL, the Court of
Chancery does not have or should not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over
such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely
in connection with any dispute that arises in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and the documents referred
to in this Agreement or in respect of the transactions, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or Proceeding for
interpretation or enforcement hereof or any such document that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or Proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such action, suit or Proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively by such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
Parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with such action, suit or Proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section 10.4_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

 **10.7 _Enforcement_**. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Parties. Prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6_, it is accordingly
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 10.7_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or
in equity.

 



 

 **10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_**. Nothing in this Agreement express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_**. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.9_.

 



      

 

 



 

 **10.10 _Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

 **10.11 _Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including via electronic means (such as Docusign, Adobe Sign,
photocopy or scan of an original signature, or otherwise), all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



 

 **10.12 _No Agreement Until Executed_**. This Agreement shall not constitute
or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding
between the Parties unless and until (a) the Company Board approves the Merger
Agreement, and the transactions and documents contemplated thereby, including
this Agreement, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by all
parties thereto, and (c) this Agreement is executed and delivered by the
Parties.

 



 

 **10.13 _Expenses_**. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost or expense, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

 **10.14 _Action in Company Stockholder Capacity Only_**. No Person executing
this Agreement (or designee or Representative of such Person) who has been, is
or becomes during the term of this Agreement a director or officer of the
Company shall be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this
Agreement in such Persons capacity as a director or officer of the Company.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is entered into by each
Company Stockholder solely in its capacity as the Beneficial Owner of shares
of Subject Securities, and not, if applicable, in such Company Stockholders
capacity as a director (including "director by deputization"), officer or
employee of the Company, and nothing in this Agreement shall (a) restrict in
any respect any actions taken (or failure to take actions) by any Company
Stockholder or its designees or Representatives who are a director or officer
of the Company solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or (b) be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict such Company
Stockholder from exercising its fiduciary duties as a director or officer of
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 10.14_
shall in any way modify, alter or amend any of the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

 



 

 **10.15 _Documentation and Information_**. No Company Stockholder shall make
any public announcement or statement regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by
applicable Law or legal process (provided that reasonable notice of any such
disclosure will be provided to Parent to the extent permitted by applicable
Law); provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any disclosure required
to be made by any Company Stockholder to the SEC or other Governmental Entity,
including any amendment of any Schedule 13D, so long as such disclosure is
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the
public statements made by the Company and Parent pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement. Each Company Stockholder consents to and hereby authorizes
Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules
filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document that
Parent reasonably determines to be necessary in connection with the Merger and
any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, such Company
Stockholders identity and ownership of the Subject Securities, the existence
of this Agreement and the nature of such Company Stockholders commitments and
obligations under this Agreement, and such Company Stockholder acknowledges
that Parent may, in Parents sole

 



     

 

 



 

discretion, file this Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity. Each Company Stockholder agrees to promptly give Parent
any information it may reasonably require for the preparation of any such
disclosure documents, and such Company Stockholder agrees to promptly notify
Parent of any required corrections with respect to any written information
supplied by such Company Stockholder specifically for use in any such
disclosure document, if and to the extent that any such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent shall in any
instance where the Company Stockholders or information relating thereto is
disclosed, use its reasonable best efforts to provide drafts of such
disclosures with sufficient time to enable the Company Stockholders to review
and provide comments on such disclosures and Parent shall in good faith
consider incorporating any reasonable modifications requested by such Company
Stockholder.

 



 

 **10.16 _Other Stockholders_**. Parent confirms that it is requiring each of
the Company Stockholders who have Affiliates or Representatives currently
serving on the Company Board (such stockholders, the " _Other Stockholders_
"), contemporaneously herewith, to enter into substantially similar agreements
that are each no less favorable to Parent than this Agreement. In the event
any provision in any of such agreements with any of the Other Stockholders (or
any amendment thereto or waiver thereof) that results in less stringent
obligations upon such Other Stockholder than those imposed upon the Company
Stockholders under this Agreement, or otherwise results in more favorable
treatment of any such Other Stockholder as compared with the Company
Stockholders treatment hereunder, such provision (or amendment thereto or
waiver thereof, as applicable) shall be deemed to be incorporated herein, and
Parent shall make reasonable best efforts to reasonably promptly inform the
Company Stockholders of such fact.

 



 

 **10.17 _Other Parties_**. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, members, managers, agents, affiliates, general or limited
partners or assignees of Parent or any Company Stockholder, or of any former,
current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person,
stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, general or limited
partner, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing, shall have any
liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, obligations or liabilities of Parent or the Company Stockholders
under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim,
litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or
failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a
party hereto or another person or otherwise.

 



 

 **10.18 _Ownership Interest_**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent, the Company or any other Person any direct or
indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to, or
pecuniary interest in, any of the Subject Securities. All rights, ownership
and economic benefits of and relating to, and pecuniary interest in, the
Subject Securities shall remain vested in and belong to the applicable Company
Stockholder, and neither Parent nor any other Person shall have any power or
authority to direct any Company Stockholder in the voting or disposition of
any of the Subject Securities, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement. Except as set forth herein, each Stockholder shall remain free to
vote (or execute consents or proxies with respect to) the Subject

 



     

 

 



 

Securities in any manner such Company Stockholder deems appropriate, including
in connection with the election of directors.

 



 

 **10.19 _Obligation to Update Schedule A_**. Each Company Stockholder agrees
that in connection with any acquisitions or Transfers (to the extent
permitted) of Subject Securities by any Company Stockholder, such Company
Stockholder will, as promptly as practicable following the completion of
thereof, notify Parent in writing of such acquisition or Transfer and the
Parties will update Schedule A to reflect the effect of such acquisition or
Transfer.

_Board_** ") and included in a certificate of designations filed pursuant to
the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the authority, to the
full extent now or hereafter provided by law, to adopt any such resolution or
resolutions.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE V 
LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY; 
INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 



 

Section 5.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. To the fullest extent that the
DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or is
hereafter amended permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of
directors, no person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any repeal or amendment of
this _Section 5.1_ by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in
law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate inconsistent
with this _Section 5.1_ will, unless otherwise required by law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits
the Corporation to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors) and
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
** _proceeding_** ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " **
_indemnitee_** "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
against all expenses, liability and loss (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee
in connection with such proceeding. The right to indemnification conferred by
this _Section 5.2_ shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if
the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery
to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for the expenses under this
_Section 5.2_ or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses conferred by this _Section 5.2_ shall be contract rights and such
rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.2_, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance
expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any
indemnitee by this _Section 5.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights
that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate,
the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or
otherwise.

 



 

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 5.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Certificate inconsistent with this _Section 5.2_, shall, unless
otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such
amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto),
and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

 



 

(d) This _Section 5.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

 



 

ARTICLE VI 
BY-LAWS

 



 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws of
the Corporation. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed
by the stockholders.

 



 

ARTICLE VII 
AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate (including any certificate of
designations filed pursuant to the DGCL), in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by this Certificate and the DGCL; and except as set forth in
_ARTICLE VII_, all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon
stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this
Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to
the right reserved in this Article.

 ** _3._** **_Dividends._**

 



 

(a) Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Stock, Holders shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds of the
Corporation legally available for payment, cumulative cash dividends at the
Dividend Rate. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall be payable
quarterly in arrears at the Dividend Rate, and shall accumulate from the most

Dividends payable for any period less than a full quarterly dividend period
(based upon the number of days elapsed during the period) shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 



 

(b) If, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including,
the date that is six months after the Initial Issue Date, the Corporation
fails to timely file any document or report that the Corporation is required
to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as
applicable (other than current reports on Form 8-K and any delay permitted
under Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act), or shares of the Series B Preferred
Stock are not otherwise freely tradable by Holders thereof other than the
Corporations affiliates (as a result of restrictions pursuant to U.S.
securities laws or the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock), the Dividend
Rate on the Series B Preferred Stock shall increase by 0.50% per annum from,
and including, the later of (i) the date six months after the Initial Issue
Date and (ii) the first date on which such failure to file exists or shares of
the Series B Preferred Stock are not otherwise freely tradable, as the case
may be, until the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Initial Issue
Date (the " ** _Scheduled Free Trade Date_** ") and (y) the date on which such
failure to file has been cured (if applicable) and the Series B Preferred
Stock are freely tradable as described above.

 



 

(c) Further, if, and for so long as:

 



 

(i) the restrictive legend on the Series B Preferred Stock described in

(iii) the Series B Preferred Stock are not otherwise freely tradable by

restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities laws or the terms of the Series B
Preferred Stock,

 



 

in each case, on or after the first day following the Scheduled Free Trade
Date, the Dividend Rate on the Series B Preferred Stock shall be increased by
0.50% per annum until such restrictive legends are removed, the Series B
Preferred Stock are assigned unrestricted CUSIP numbers and the Series B
Preferred Stock are freely tradable as described above.

 



 

(d) Any additional dividends paid pursuant to _Section 3(b)_ or _Section
3(c)_ shall be payable at the times and in the manner provided for the payment
of regular dividends in _Section 3(a)_.

 



 

(e) If any Dividend Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day,
the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no
interest or dividends on such payment will accrue or accumulate, as the case
may be, in respect of the delay.

 



 

(f) No dividend shall be declared or paid upon, or any sum of cash set apart
for the payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series B
Preferred Stock with respect to any dividend period unless all accumulated
dividends for all preceding dividend periods have been

 



 

Annex A - 8    

 

 



 

declared and paid upon, or a sufficient sum in cash has been set apart for the
payment of such dividends upon, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock.

 



 

(g) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, no
dividends or other distributions (other than (i) in the case of Parity Stock,
a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior
Stock, (ii) in the case of Junior Stock, a dividend or distribution payable
solely in shares of Junior Stock and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares)
may be declared, made or paid upon, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity
Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or
made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or
Junior Stock) by the Corporation or on behalf of the Corporation or by any of
the Corporations Subsidiaries, unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends
for all preceding dividend periods have been or contemporaneously are declared
and paid in full in cash, or a sum sufficient of cash for the payment thereof
is set apart for such dividends upon, the Series B Preferred Stock and any
Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods ending on or prior to the date
of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. The
foregoing limitation shall not apply to:

 



 

(i) conversions into or exchanges for (A) in the case of Parity Stock, shares
of Parity Stock or Junior Stock or cash solely in lieu of fractional shares of
Parity Stock or Junior Stock and (B) in the case of Junior Stock, shares of
Junior Stock or cash solely in lieu of fractional shares of Junior Stock;

 



 

(ii) payments in connection with the satisfaction of employees tax
withholding obligations pursuant to employee benefit plans or outstanding
awards (and payment of any corresponding requisite amounts to the appropriate
governmental authority);

 



 

(iii) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of Parity Stock or Junior
Stock in connection with the administration of any benefit or other incentive
plan, including any employment contract, in the ordinary course of business;

 



 

(iv) any dividends or distributions of rights in connection with a
stockholders rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant
to any stockholders rights plan; or

 



 

(v) the deemed purchase or acquisition of fractional interests in shares of
Parity Stock or Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions
of such Parity Stock or Junior Stock or the security being converted or
exchanged.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the
Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and
paid on the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the
dividends are declared and paid _pro rata_ so that the amounts of dividends
declared per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and shares of
such Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that
accumulated and unpaid dividends per share (whether or not declared) on the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock and shares of such Parity Stock bear to
each other, in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.

 



 

Annex A - 9    

 

 



 

(h) Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any
dividend in excess of full cumulative dividends.

 



 

(i) The Holders at the Close of Business on a Dividend Record Date shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, out of funds
legally available for payment, the dividend payment on their respective shares
of Series B Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date
notwithstanding the conversion of such shares in accordance with _Section 9_
following such Dividend Record Date. However, notwithstanding the foregoing,
shares of Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion during the
period between the Close of Business on any Dividend Record Date and the Close
of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the corresponding
Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount of cash
equal to the dividend payable on such shares on that Dividend Payment Date;
_provided_ that no such payment is required in respect of a mandatory
conversion pursuant to _Section 10_ during such period or if the Special
Rights End Date occurs during such period. Except as provided in _Section 9_
with respect to a voluntary conversion, the Corporation shall make no payment
or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on converted
shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

 



 

(j) Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, securities or
other property) as may be determined by the Board may be declared and paid on
any of the Corporations securities, including Common Stock, from time to time
out of funds legally available for such payment, and the Holders shall not be
entitled to participate in any such dividends.

 



 

 ** _4._** **_Method of Payment of Dividends_** _._ The Corporation will pay
any dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock for a current dividend period or
any prior dividend period (including in connection with the payment of
declared and unpaid dividends pursuant to _Section 5_ and _Section 10_) in
cash. All payments to which a Holder is entitled in connection with a
dividend declared on the Series B Preferred Stock will be rounded to the
nearest cent.

 



 

 ** _5._** **_Special Rights Upon a Fundamental Change_**.

 



 

(a) A Holder shall have the right, in connection with any Fundamental Change,
to convert shares of Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 9_
for that number of shares of Common Stock set forth in _Section 5(b)_ at any
time during the period (the " ** _Fundamental Change Conversion Period_**
")beginning at the Open of Business on the Trading Day immediately following
the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change and ending at the Close of Business
on the 20th Trading Day immediately following such Effective Date (or (x) if
earlier, the Mandatory Conversion Date, if applicable, or (y) if later, as
extended by _Section 5(d)_) (such end date, the " ** _Special Rights End
Date_** "), subject to the provisions of this _Section 5_.

 



 

(b) If a Holder converts shares of its Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to
this _Section 5_ during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, the
Corporation shall deliver to such converting Holder, for each share of Series
B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion, a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the sum of (A) the Conversion Rate and (B) the Make-Whole
Premium determined pursuant to _Section 5(f)_, if any. In addition, each
Holder that converts shares of its Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this
_Section 5_, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion pursuant to this _Section 5(b)_ shall, on any

 



 

Annex A - 10    

 

 



 

conversion date during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, have the
right to receive an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on
such converted shares, whether or not declared prior to that date, for all
prior dividend periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment Date
immediately preceding (or, if applicable, ending on) the conversion date
(other than previously declared dividends payable to Holders of record as of a
prior date), provided that the Corporation is then legally permitted to pay
such dividends. The amount payable in respect of such dividends will be paid
in cash.

 



 

(c) For any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are converted pursuant to
this _Section 5_ during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, subject to
the limitations described herein, the Corporation shall have the right to pay
the Make-Whole Premium, in its sole discretion, (i) in cash; (ii) by delivery
of shares of Common Stock; or (iii) by delivery of any combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock. Except to the extent the Corporation elects to make
all or any portion of such payment in shares of Common Stock, the Corporation
will pay the Make-Whole Premium on the Series B Preferred Stock in cash.

 



 

(d) The Corporation shall give notice (a " ** _Fundamental Change Notice_** ")
of each Fundamental Change to all Holders no later than 15 Business Days prior
to the anticipated Effective Date of the Fundamental Change or, if such prior
notice is not practicable, no later than two Business Days after such
Fundamental Change. If the Corporation notifies Holders of a Fundamental
Change later than the 15th Business Day prior to the actual Effective Date of
such Fundamental Change, the Fundamental Change Conversion Period will be
extended by a number of days equal to the number of days from, and including,
the 15th Business Day prior to the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change
to, but not including, the date of the notice; _provided_ that the Fundamental
Change Conversion Period will not be extended beyond the Mandatory Conversion
Date, if applicable.

 



 

(e) The Fundamental Change Notice shall be given in any manner compliant with
the procedures of the Depository in effect at such time to each Holder on the
date such notice is given. The Fundamental Change Notice shall state (i) the
anticipated Effective Date of such Fundamental Change; (ii) the Special Rights
End Date; (iii) the name and address of the Transfer Agent; and (iv) the
procedures that Holders must follow to exercise their conversion right
pursuant to this _Section 5_.

 



 

(f) The number of additional shares of Common Stock, if any, to be added to
Conversion Rate per share of Series B Preferred Stock in connection with a
Fundamental Change pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ above (the " ** _Make-Whole
Premium_** ") shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on
the Effective Date and the Stock Price with respect to such Fundamental
Change.

Annex A - 11     

 

  (1) The Stock Prices set forth in the table above shall be adjusted as of any
date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices
shall be equal to the Stock Prices immediately prior to such adjustment,
_multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate
immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment
and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The
number of additional shares in the table above will be adjusted in the same
manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate as set forth under _Section
9_.

 



 

(g) The exact Stock Price and Effective Date may not be set forth on the table
above, in which case:

 



 

(i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices on the table or the
Effective Date is between two Effective Dates on the table, the Make-Whole
Premium shall be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-
Whole Premium set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices or the earlier
and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;

 



 

(ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $100.00 per share (subject to
adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices), no Make-Whole Premium will
be added to the Conversion Rate; and

 



 

(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $25.68 per share (subject to adjustment
in the same manner as the Stock Prices), no Make-Whole Premium will be added
to the Conversion Rate.

 



 

(h) Whenever any provision of this Certificate of Designations requires the
Corporation to calculate the Closing Sale Prices or the Stock Prices for
purposes of determining any Make-Whole Premium in connection with a
Fundamental Change, the Board shall make appropriate adjustments to each to
account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or
any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Record Date
of the event occurs, at any time during the period when such Closing Sale
Prices or Stock Prices are to be calculated.

 



 

 ** _6._** **_Voting_**. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have
voting rights other than those set forth below or as otherwise required by
Delaware law or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation (as so amended and as further amended from time to time in
accordance with its terms and the DGCL, the " ** _Certificate of
Incorporation_** "):

 



 

(a) If at any time a Voting Rights Triggering Event has occurred, then the
Holders, voting as a single class with any other series of Preferred Stock or
preference securities having similar voting rights that are exercisable
(together, the " ** _Voting Rights Class_** "), shall be entitled at the next
regular or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to elect two
additional directors to the Board. Upon the election of any such additional
directors, the number of directors that comprise the Board shall be increased
by such number of additional directors.

 



 

(b) The voting rights set forth in _Section 6(a)_ may be exercised at a
special meeting of the Corporations stockholders, or at any annual meeting of
stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors, and thereafter at
each such special or annual meeting until such time as all dividends in
arrears, the nonpayment of which caused the Voting Rights Triggering Event,
shall have been paid in full, at which time or times, automatically and
without any further action by any

 



 

Annex A - 12    

 

 



 

Person, such voting rights shall terminate (subject to the reinstatement of
such rights upon a subsequent Voting Rights Triggering Event).

 



 

(c) At any meeting at which the holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class
shall have the right to elect directors as provided in _Section 6(a)_, the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares representing more than
fifty percent (50%) in voting power of the then outstanding shares of the
Voting Rights Class shall be required and shall be sufficient to onstitute a
quorum of such class for the election of directors by such class. The
affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing more than fifty percent
(50%) in voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Voting Rights
Class present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to
elect any such director. Any director elected pursuant to the voting rights
set forth in this _Section 6_ may be removed at any time, with or without
cause, by the holders of record of shares representing more than fifty percent
(50%) in voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Voting Rights
Class at any time during which such holders rights pursuant to _Section
6(a)_ continue. Any vacancy in respect of any such additional director
arising at any time during which such holders rights pursuant to _Section
6(a)_ continue (other than prior to the first election immediately following
the applicable Voting Rights Triggering Event) may be filled by the written
consent of the director elected by the Voting Rights Class remaining in
office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of shares
representing more than fifty percent (50%) in voting power of the then
outstanding shares of the Voting Rights Class; _provided_ that the filling of
each vacancy shall not violate the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Corporation as in effect on the effective date of this Certificate of
Designations or the corporate governance requirements of The New York Stock
Exchange (or any other exchange or automated quotation system on which
securities of the Corporation may be listed or quoted) that requires listed or
quoted companies to have a majority of independent directors. Directors
elected pursuant to the voting rights set forth in _Section 6(a)_ shall be
entitled to one vote per director on any matter.

 



 

(d) Any director elected pursuant to the voting rights set forth in _Section
6(a)_ shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders;
_provided, however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, at such time as all
dividends in arrears, the nonpayment of which caused the Voting Rights
Triggering Event, have been paid in full, then, automatically and without any
further action by any Person, the terms of office of directors elected
pursuant to the voting rights set forth in this _Section 6_ shall cease and
the number of directors comprising the Board shall be reduced accordingly.

 



 

(e) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in voting power of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock outstanding at the time, voting together as a single class with all
series of Parity Stock upon which similar voting rights have been conferred
and are exercisable, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a
meeting:

 



 

(i) amend or alter the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this
Certificate of Designations so as to authorize or create, or increase the
authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of Senior Stock or
reclassify any of our authorized Capital Stock into shares of Senior Stock, or
create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or
evidencing the right to purchase any shares of Senior Stock;

 



 

Annex A - 13    

 

 



 

(ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
or this Certificate of Designations (an " ** _Event_** ") so as to adversely
affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock;

 



 

(iii) consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with another entity, unless in each case: (A) shares of Series B
Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or
consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or
resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of
the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent; and (B) such shares
of Series B Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference
securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and
voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the
holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of
the Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as
a whole; _provided, however_ , that:

 



 

(i) any increase in the amount of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred
Stock;

 



 

(ii) any increase in the authorized or issued shares of Series B Preferred
Stock; and

 



 

(iii) the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any other series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock,

 



 

shall be deemed not to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers of Holders and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent
of Holders.

 



 

(f) If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification,
merger or consolidation described in this _Section 6_ would affect one or
more but not all series of voting Preferred Stock (including the Series B
Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series of voting Preferred
Stock adversely affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of
all other series of voting Preferred Stock.

 



 

(g) Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the Series B Preferred
Stock andany other voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any
matter shall be determined by reference to the respective liquidation
preference amounts of the Series B Preferred Stock and such other voting
Preferred Stock.

 



 

(h) Without the consent of the Holders, the Corporation may amend, alter,
supplement or repeal any terms of the Series B Preferred Stock to (i) conform
the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock to the description thereof in the

 ** _7._** **_Liquidation Preference._**

 



 

(a) In the event of any liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, each Holder shall be entitled
to receive in respect of its shares of Series B Preferred Stock and to be paid
out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its
stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to the Corporations creditors
and holders of shares of Senior Stock and before any payment or distribution
is made to holders of Junior Stock (including the Common Stock), the
Liquidation Preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock _plus_ an amount
equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares, whether or not
declared, to, but not including the date fixed for liquidation, winding up or
dissolution.

 



 

(b) Neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer of all or substantially
all the assets or business of the Corporation (other than in connection with
the liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Corporation), nor the merger
or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Person, nor any
share exchange or division involving the Corporation pursuant to applicable
statutes providing for the consolidation, merger, share exchange or division,
shall be deemed to be a liquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether
voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this _Section 7_,
notwithstanding that, for other purposes, such as for tax purposes, such an
event may constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, no
payment shall be made to Holders pursuant to this _Section 7_ upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, of
any of the Corporations Subsidiaries or upon any reorganization of the
Corporations Subsidiaries with or without the approval of the Corporations
stockholders.

 



 

(c) After the payment to the Holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
of full preferential amounts provided for in this _Section 7_, the Holders of
Series B Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the
remaining assets of the Corporation.

 



 

(d) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
the Holders and holders of shares of Parity Stock upon any liquidation,
winding up or dissolution of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to this _Section 7_, such Holders and such
holders of shares of Parity Stock shall share, equally and ratably in
proportion to the respective full amounts to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to this _Section 7_, in any distribution of the assets of the
Corporation.

 



 

 ** _8._** **_Acquisition Termination Redemption._**

 



 

(a) No sinking fund is provided for the Series B Preferred Stock. If the
Purchase Agreement is terminated (other than by consummation of the Delaware
Basin Acquisition), the Corporation shall have the right, at its option, to
redeem (an " ** _Optional Redemption_** ") all, but not less than all, of the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of such redemption,
on an Acquisition Termination Redemption Date to occur on or prior to April 1,
2017, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) $1,010.00, (ii)
accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Acquisition
Termination Redemption Date and (iii) 90% of the excess, if any, of the
Acquisition Termination Redemption Conversion Value over the Initial
Conversion Value (unless the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date falls
after a regular Dividend Record Date but on or prior to the immediately
succeeding Dividend Payment Date, in which case the Corporation shall pay the
full amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends to the applicable

 



 

Annex A - 15    

 

 



 

Holders as of the Close of Business on such Dividend Record Date and the
Acquisition Termination Redemption Price shall not include any such
accumulated and unpaid dividends) (the " ** _Acquisition Termination
Redemption Price_** "). The Acquisition Termination Redemption Price shall be
paid by the Corporation in cash to each Holder. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Series B Preferred Stock are not redeemable pursuant to this _Section 8_
after April 1, 2017.

 



 

(b) In case the Corporation exercises its Optional Redemption right to redeem
all of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, it shall fix
a date, which must be a Business Day, for redemption (an " ** _Acquisition
Termination Redemption Date_** "), and the Corporation shall deliver to each
Holder so to be redeemed a notice of such Optional Redemption (an " **
_Acquisition Termination Redemption Notice_** ") not less than 40 nor more
than 60 calendar days prior to the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date in
any manner compliant with the procedures of the Depository in effect at such
time.

 



 

(c) The Acquisition Termination Redemption Notice, if sent in any manner
compliant with the procedures of the Depository in effect at such time, shall
be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder of
any Series B Preferred Stock receives such notice. In any case, failure to
give such Acquisition Termination Redemption Notice in a manner compliant with
the procedures of the Depository in effect at such time or any defect in the
Acquisition Termination Redemption Notice to the Holder of any shares of
Series B Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series B
Preferred Stock.

 



 

(d) Each Acquisition Termination Redemption Notice shall specify, among other
things:

 



 

(i) the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date;

 



 

(ii) the Acquisition Termination Redemption Price (or manner of calculation if
not then known);

 



 

(iii) that on the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date, the Acquisition
Termination Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such share
of Series B Preferred Stock, and that dividends thereon, if any, shall cease
to accumulate on and after said date;

 



 

(iv) that Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may surrender their Series B
Preferred Stock for conversion at any time prior to the Close of Business on
the Business Day immediately preceding the Acquisition Termination Redemption
Date;

 



 

(v) the Conversion Rate as of the date of such notice; and

 



 

(vi) the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers, if any, assigned to such Series
B Preferred Stock and that no representation is made as to the correctness or
accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the
Series B Preferred Stock.

 



 

(e) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, from
and after the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date unless the Acquisition
Termination

 



 

Annex A - 16    

 

 



 

Redemption Price has been paid in full for all shares of Series B Preferred
Stock on the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date, no dividends or other
distributions (other than (i) in the case of Parity Stock, a dividend or
distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock, (ii) in
the case of Junior Stock, a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares
of Junior Stock and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared,
made or paid upon, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior
Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior
Stock) by the Corporation or on behalf of the Corporation or by any of the
Corporations Subsidiaries, unless the Acquisition Termination Redemption
Price has been paid in full upon, or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
is set apart for such payment upon, the Series B Preferred Stock and any
dividends on all Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods ending on or
prior to the Acquisition Termination Redemption Date have been declared and
paid, or declared and a sufficient sum has been set apart for the payment of
such dividend, upon all outstanding shares of Parity Stock. The foregoing
limitation shall not apply to:

 



 

(i) conversions into or exchanges for (A) in the case of Parity Stock, shares
of Parity Stock or Junior Stock or cash solely in lieu of fractional shares of
Parity Stock or Junior Stock and (B) in the case of Junior Stock, shares of
Junior Stock or cash solely in lieu of fractional shares of Junior Stock;

 



 

(ii) payments in connection with the satisfaction of employees tax
withholding obligations pursuant to employee benefit plans or outstanding
awards (and payment of any corresponding requisite amounts to the appropriate
governmental authority);

 



 

(iii) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of Parity Stock or Junior
Stock in connection with the administration of any benefit or other incentive
plan, including any employment contract, in the ordinary course of business;

 



 

(iv) any dividends or distributions of rights in connection with a
stockholders rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant
to any stockholders rights plan; or

 



 

(v) the deemed purchase or acquisition of fractional interests in shares of
Parity Stock or Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions
of such Parity Stock or Junior Stock or the security being converted or
exchanged.

 



 

 ** _9._** **_Conversion._**

 



 

(a) Each Holder shall have the right at any time, at its option, to convert,
subject to the terms and provisions of this _Section 9_, any or all of such
Holders shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of
33.8616 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, subject
to adjustment as provided in this _Section 9_, (the " ** _Conversion Rate_**
"), per share of Series B Preferred Stock. Upon conversion of any share of
Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall deliver to the converting
Holder, in respect of each share of Series B Preferred Stock being converted,
a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the third
Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date.

 



 

Annex A - 17    

 

 



 

(b) Before any Holder shall be entitled to convert a share of Series B
Preferred Stock as set forth in _Section 9(a)_, such Holder shall (i) in the
event such Holder holds a beneficial interest in Global Series B Preferred
Stock, comply with the procedures of the Depository in effect at the time of
conversion for converting a beneficial interest in a global security and, if
required, pay funds equal to any dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment
Date to which such Holder is not entitled pursuant to _Section 3(i)_, and
(ii) in the event such Holder holds Certificated Series B Preferred Stock, (1)
complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of such share of
Certificated Series B Preferred Stock (or a facsimile thereof), stating the
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or
names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for any shares of Common Stock to be delivered to be registered
(a " ** _Notice of Conversion_** "), a form of which is attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_, and deliver such Notice of Conversion, which is irrevocable, to
the Transfer Agent, in its capacity as the conversion agent (or such other
agent designated by the Corporation) (the " ** _Conversion Agent_** "), (2)
surrender such shares of Certificated Series B Preferred Stock to the
Conversion Agent, (3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, (4) if required, pay funds equal to any dividend payable
on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled
pursuant to _Section 3(i)_, and (5) if required, pay all transfer or similar
taxes, if any, as set forth more fully herein. The Conversion Agent shall
notify the Corporation of any conversion pursuant to this _Section 9_ on the
Conversion Date for such conversion. The date on which a Holder complies with
the procedures in this _Section 9(b)_ is the " ** _Conversion Date_**." If
more than one share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for
conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of shares of Common
Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock so surrendered.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Conversion Date with
respect to a conversion, conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion shall be deemed to have been effected, and, as of
the Close of Business on the Conversion Date, the converting Holder of such
shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record
of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holders Series B
Preferred Stock notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation
shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Common Stock shall
not then be actually delivered to such Holder. On the date of any conversion,
all rights with respect to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock so
converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices, will terminate,
excepting only the rights of holders thereof to (i) receive certificates for
the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock have been converted; and (ii) exercise the rights to which
they are thereafter entitled as holders of Common Stock.

 



 

(d) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, without duplication, upon the
occurrence of any of the following events:

 



 

(i) If the Corporation exclusively issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend
or distribution on all shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a
share subdivision or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted
based on the following formula:

 



 

Annex A - 18    

 

 



 

![](g404142kc41i001.gif)

 



 

where,

 



 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business
on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to
the Open of Business on the Effective Date of such share subdivision or share
combination, as the case may be;

 



 

CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on
the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the
Open of Business on the Effective Date of such share subdivision or share
combination, as the case may be;

 



 

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or
immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Effective Date of such share
subdivision or share combination, as the case may be; and

 



 

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after, and
solely as a result of, giving effect to such dividend or distribution, or such
share subdivision or share combination, as the case may be.

 



 

Any adjustment made under this _Section 9(d)(i)_ shall become effective
immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend
or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the Effective
Date for such share subdivision or share combination, as the case may be. If
any dividend, distribution, share subdivision or share combination of the type
described in this _Section 9(d)(i)_ is declared but not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier
of (A) the date the Board determines not to pay or make such dividend,
distribution, subdivision or combination and (B) the date the dividend or
distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or combination was to
have been effective, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if
such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
The Corporation shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares
of Common Stock held in treasury.

 



 

(ii) If the Corporation distributes to all or substantially all holders of its
Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period
expiring not more than 45 calendar days after the date of issuance thereof, to
purchase or subscribe for shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is
less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and

 



 

Annex A - 19    

 

 



 

including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date of such
distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following
formula:

 



 

![](g404142kc41i002.gif)

 



 

where,

 



    

CR0

on the Record Date for such distribution; 

---|---

CR1

the Record Date for such distribution;

OS0

 |  

= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 

   



 |  


 
   

X

 |  

= the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
rights, options or warrants; and 

   



 |  


 
   

Y

 |  

= the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the
aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants and (B)
the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day
immediately preceding the Ex-Date of such distribution. 

 



 

Any increase made under this _Section 9(d)(ii)_ shall be made successively
whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become
effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such
distribution. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not issued prior
to the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date of such
expiration, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the
increase with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants
been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common
Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so
distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the
earlier of (A) the date the Board determines not to make such distribution and
(B) the date such rights, options or warrants were to have been issued, to be
the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such
distribution had not occurred. If such rights, options or warrants are only
exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then the
Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted until the triggering events occur.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 9(d)(ii)_, in determining whether any rights,
options or warrants entitle the holders of the Common Stock to subscribe for
or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing
Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period
ending on, and including, the Trading Day

 



 

Annex A - 20    

 

 



 

immediately preceding the Ex-Date of such distribution, and in determining the
aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken
into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights,
options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof,
the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the
Board.

 



 

(iii) If the Corporation distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of
its indebtedness or other assets, securities or property of the Corporation or
rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities,
to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, excluding (A) dividends,
distributions, rights, options, warrants or other issuances as to which an
adjustment was effected pursuant to _Section 9(d)(i)_ or _Section 9(d)(ii)_,
(B) rights issued to all holders of Common Stock pursuant to a rights plan,
where such rights are not presently exercisable, trade with Common Stock and
the plan provides that Holders will receive such rights along with any Common
Stock received upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, (C) dividends
or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was
effected pursuant to (or a cash amount paid pursuant to the last paragraph of)
_Section 9(d)(iv)_, (D) any dividends and distributions in connection with
any recapitalization, reclassification, change, consolidation, merger or other
combination, share exchange, or sale, lease or other transfer or disposition
resulting in the change in the conversion consideration as described in
_Section 9(h)_ and (D) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below
in the last two paragraphs of this _Section 9(d)(iii)_ shall apply, then the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

outstanding share of Common Stock. 

 



 

Annex A - 21     

 

 



 

Any increase made under the portion of this _Section 9(d)(iii)_ above shall
become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date
for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (A) the
date the Board determines not to pay the distribution and (B) the date such
dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to be the Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or
greater than "SP0" (as defined above), or if the difference is less than
$1.00, in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, for each
share of Series B Preferred Stock held by it, at the same time and upon the
same terms as holders of the Common Stock, the amount and kind of the
Corporations Capital Stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of
indebtedness, or other assets, securities or property of the Corporation, or
rights, options or warrants to acquire the Corporations Capital Stock or
other securities that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect
immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for the
distribution.

 



 

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this _Section 9(d)(iii)_ where
there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common
Stock consisting solely of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or
similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business
unit of the Corporation where such Capital Stock or similar equity interest
is, or will be when issued, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national
securities exchange (a " ** _Spin-Off_** "), the Conversion Rate will be

become effective at the Close of Business on the 10th Trading Day immediately
following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off; _provided_ that, for
purposes of determining the Conversion Rate in respect of any conversion
during the 10 Trading Days following, and including, the Ex-Date of any Spin-
Off, references to "10 consecutive Trading Days" within the portion of this
_Section 9(d)(iii)_ related to Spin-Offs shall be deemed to be replaced with
such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-
Date of such Spin-Off and the relevant Conversion Date.

holders of Common Stock (excluding dividends or distributions made in
connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
and any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer
made by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), the Conversion Rate shall

date the Board determines not to pay or make such dividend or distribution and
(B) the date such dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to be the
Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution

purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange
offer, but the Corporation or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by
applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are
rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be such Conversion
Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had
not been made.

 



 

(vi) All calculations and other determinations under this _Section 9(d)_
shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest one-ten
thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no adjustment under this _Section 9(d)_ shall be made to the
Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would result in a change of at least 1%
in the Conversion Rate then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried
forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent
adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so
carried forward, shall amount to a change of at least 1% in such Conversion
Rate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation shall make all such
carried-forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is
less than 1%, (A) on December 31 of each calendar year, (B) on the Conversion
Date for any conversions of Series B Preferred Stock, (C) upon the occurrence
of a Fundamental Change and (D) in the event that the Corporation exercises
its mandatory conversion right pursuant to _Section 10_. No adjustment to
the Conversion Rate shall be made if it results in a Conversion Price that is
less than the par value (if any) of the Common Stock. The Corporation shall
not take any action that would result in the Conversion Price being less than
the par value (if any) of the Common Stock pursuant to this Certificate of
Designations and without giving effect to the previous sentence.

 



 

(vii) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) of this _Section 9(d)_, and to the extent permitted by
applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of The New York Stock
Exchange, the Corporation, from time to time, may increase the Conversion Rate
by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days or any longer period
permitted or required by law, so long as the increase is irrevocable during
that period and the Board determines that such increase would be in the
Corporations best interest. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall send to each Holder
at its last address appearing on the stock register of the Corporation a
notice of the increase at least 15 calendar days prior to the date the
increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the
increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.

 



 

(viii) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 9(d)_ and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted for: (A) the
issuance of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for
the reinvestment of dividends or

 



 

Annex A - 25    

 

 



 

interest payable on securities of the Corporation and the investment of
additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan; (B) the
issuance of Common Stock, options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance units or rights to purchase those shares or similar equity
instruments pursuant to any present or future employee, director, trustee or
consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) the issuance of Common Stock
pursuant to any option, warrant, right or excisable, exchangeable or
convertible security outstanding as of the Initial Issue Date; (D) a change in
the par value of Common Stock; (E) a sale of Common Stock, or securities
convertible or exercisable for Common Stock, for cash, other than in a
transaction described in _Section 9 (d)(i)_ through _Section 9(d)(v)_; (F)
ordinary course of business stock repurchases that are not tender offers
referred to in _Section 9(d)(v)_, including structured or derivative
transactions or pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by the Board;
(G) a third-party tender or exchange offer, other than a tender or exchange
offer by one of the Corporations Subsidiaries as described in _Section
9(d)(v)_; and (H) accumulated and unpaid dividends or distributions, except as
provided in _Section 5_ and _Section 10_. Except as described in this
_Section 9_, we will not adjust the conversion rate.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 9(d)(ii)_ and _Section 9(d)(iii)_, if the
Corporation has a rights plan (including the distribution of rights pursuant
thereto to all holders of Common Stock) in effect while any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock remain outstanding (including the rights plan adopted by the
Corporation in May 2016), Holders will receive, upon conversion of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, in addition to shares of Common Stock to which each
such Holder is entitled, a corresponding number of rights in accordance with
such rights plan. If, prior to any conversion of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, such rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable rights plan, the Conversion
Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had
distributed to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, shares of
Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, securities, property,
rights, options or warrants as described in _Section 9(d)(iii)_ above,
subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or
redemption of such rights. Any distribution of rights, options or warrants
pursuant to a rights plan that would allow a Holder to receive upon conversion
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in addition to any shares of Common
Stock to which such Holder is entitled, the rights described therein (unless
such rights, options or warrants have separated from the Common Stock (in
which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as
if the Corporation made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock as
described in _Section 9(d)(iii)_, subject to readjustment in the event of the
expiration, termination or redemption of such rights)) shall not constitute a
distribution of rights, options or warrants that would entitle such Holder to
an adjustment to the Conversion Rate.

 



 

(f) The Corporation may also (but is not required to) increase each Conversion
Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights
to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with a dividend or
distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event.
However, in either case, the Corporation may only make such a discretionary
adjustment if it makes the same proportionate adjustment to each Conversion
Rate.

 



 

(g) Upon any increase in the Conversion Rate, the Corporation promptly shall
deliver to each Holder a certificate signed by an Officer of the Corporation,
setting forth in reasonable

 



 

Annex A - 26    

 

 



 

detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such
adjustment was calculated, and specifying the increased Conversion Rate then
in effect following such adjustment.

 



 

(h) In the case of:

 



 

(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change in Common Stock (other
than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par
value to par value, or changes resulting from a subdivision or combination),

 



 

(ii) any consolidation, merger or other combination involving the Corporation,

 



 

(iii) any sale, lease or other transfer or disposition to a third party of the
consolidated assets of the Corporation and the Corporations Subsidiaries
substantially as an entirety, or

 



 

(iv) any statutory share exchange of the Corporations securities with another
person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition),

 



 

in each case, as a result of which Common Stock would be converted into, or
exchanged for, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including
cash or any combination thereof) (any such transaction or event, a " **
_Reorganization Event_** "), then, at and after the effective time of such
Reorganization Event, the right to convert each share of Series B Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock shall be changed into a right to convert
such share of Series B Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of
stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any
combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Reorganization Event would
have been entitled to receive upon such Reorganization Event (such stock,
securities or other property or assets, the " ** _Reference Property_** ").
The Corporation shall amend its Certificate of Incorporation to effect this
change, if applicable. In the event that, in connection with any such
Reorganization Event, the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to
elect the form of all or any portion of the consideration to be received by
such holders in such Reorganization Event, the Reference Property into which
shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible shall be deemed to be
the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the
holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such election (or of all
holders of Common Stock if no holders of Common Stock make such election).
The Corporation shall not become a party to any Reorganization Event unless
its terms are consistent with this _Section 9(h)_. Notwithstanding _Section
9(d)_, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made for any
Reorganization Event to the extent stock, securities or other property or
assets become the Reference Property receivable upon conversion of Series B
Preferred Stock.

 



 

The Corporation shall provide, by amendment hereto effective upon any such
Reorganization Event, for anti-dilution and other adjustments that shall be as
nearly equivalent as is possible to the adjustments provided for in this
_Section 9_. The provisions of this _Section 9(h)_ shall apply to
successive Reorganization Events.

 



 

None of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9(h)_ shall affect the
right of a Holder to convert its Series B Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock as set forth in _Section 9(a)_ prior to the effective time of
such Reorganization Event.

 



 

Annex A - 27    

 

 



 

In this Certificate of Designations, if Common Stock has been replaced by
Reference Property as a result of any such Reorganization Event, references to
"Common Stock" are intended to refer to such Reference Property.

 



 

(i) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance
upon the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock a number of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of all shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (including the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion during a Fundamental Change Conversion Period),
and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares
of Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient unissued shares of
Common Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

 



 

(j) A converting Holder is not required to pay any transfer or similar taxes
due upon conversion of such Holders shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
except that such Holder shall pay such transfer or similar taxes payable
relating to any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of
Common Stock, if any, due upon conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred
Stock in a name other than that of the converting Holder. The Corporation may
require that such converting Holder establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Corporation, that such converting Holder has paid in full all
applicable transfer or similar taxes, if any, payable by such converting
Holder prior to issuing and delivered the shares of Common Stock due upon
conversion of such converting Holders shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon surrender of a share of Series B Preferred
Stock for conversion, the Corporation or an applicable withholding agent may
deduct and withhold on cash dividends, shares of Common Stock or sale proceeds
paid, subsequently paid or credited (or on the consideration otherwise
delivered) with respect to such Holder or its successors and assigns the
amount required to be deducted and withheld under applicable law.

 



 

 ** _10._** **_Mandatory Conversion._**

 



 

(a) At any time on or after October 15, 2021, the Corporation shall have the
right, at its option, to elect to cause all, and not part, of the outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that
number of shares of Common Stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock
equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Mandatory Conversion Date. The
Corporation may exercise its right to cause a mandatory conversion pursuant to
this _Section 10_ only if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock equals
or exceeds 150% of the Conversion Price then in effect for at least 20 Trading
Days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days,
including the last Trading Day of such 30 Trading Day period, ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Business Day on which the
Corporation issues a press release announcing the mandatory conversion as
described in _Section 10(b)_.

 



 

(b) To exercise the mandatory conversion right described in _Section 10(a)_,
the Corporation must issue a press release giving notice of such mandatory
conversion for publication on the Dow Jones News Service or Bloomberg Business
News (or another broadly disseminated news or press release service selected
by the Corporation) prior to the Open of Business on the first Trading Day
immediately following any date on which the condition described in

 



 

Annex A - 28    

 

 



 

 _Section 10(a)_ is met, announcing such a mandatory conversion. The
conversion date will be a date selected by the Corporation (the " **
_Mandatory Conversion Date_** ") and will be no later than 10 calendar days
after the date on which the Corporation issues the press release described in
this _Section 10(b)_. In addition to any information required by applicable
law or regulation, such press release and notice of a mandatory conversion
shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Mandatory Conversion Date; (ii) the
number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of
Series B Preferred Stock; and (iii) that dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock to be converted will cease to accumulate on the Mandatory Conversion
Date.

 



 

(c) On and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, dividends shall cease to
accumulate on the Series B Preferred Stock called for a mandatory conversion
pursuant to this _Section 10_ and all rights of Holders shall terminate
except for the right to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion thereof and, if applicable, a dividend on a Dividend Payment Date
as provided in the following sentence. The full amount of any dividend
payment with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock called for a mandatory
conversion pursuant to this _Section 10_ on a date during the period
beginning at the Close of Business on any Dividend Record Date and ending at
the Close of Business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be
payable when, as and if declared by the Board, out of funds legally available
for payment, on such Dividend Payment Date to the record holder of such share
at the Close of Business on such Dividend Record Date if such share has been
mandatorily converted after such Dividend Record Date and prior to such
Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence with respect to a mandatory conversion pursuant to this _Section
10_, no payment or adjustment shall be made upon conversion of Series B
Preferred Stock for accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not
declared).

 



 

(d) The Corporation may not authorize, issue a press release or give notice of
any mandatory conversion pursuant to this _Section 10_ unless, prior to
giving the mandatory conversion notice, all accumulated and unpaid dividends
on the Series B Preferred Stock (whether or not declared) for dividend periods
ended prior to the date of such mandatory conversion notice shall have been
paid or such accumulated and unpaid dividends are declared and a sum
sufficient in cash for payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for
payment on or prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date.

 



 

 ** _11._** **_No Fractional Shares_**. No fractional shares of Common Stock
or securities representing fractional shares of Common Stock will be delivered
upon redemption or conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, whether
voluntary or mandatory. Instead, the Corporation shall round up to the
nearest whole share the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered.

 



 

 ** _12._** **_Rule 144A Information_**. At any time the Corporation is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Corporation will, so
long as any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock or any shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock will, at such
time, constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3)
under the Securities Act, promptly provide to Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, as Transfer Agent, and, upon written request, provide to any
holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act to facilitate
the resale of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock or shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Rule 144A under the

 



 

Annex A - 29    

 

 



 

Securities Act. The Corporation will take such further action as any Holder or
beneficial owner of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock may reasonably
request to the extent from time to time required to enable such Holder or
beneficial owner to sell such shares of Series B Preferred Stock or shares of
Common Stock in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such
rule may be amended from time to time.

 



 

 ** _13._** **_Transfer Restrictions_**.

 



 

(a) Until the date (the " ** _Resale Restriction Termination Date_** ") that
is the later of (1) the date that is one year after the last date of original
issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock or such other period of time as
permitted by Rule 144 or any successor provision thereto and (2) such later
date, if any, as may be required by applicable law, any certificate evidencing
the Series B Preferred Stock (and all securities issued in exchange therefor
or substitution thereof, other than Common Stock of the Corporation, if any,

Section 13(c), if applicable) shall bear a legend in substantially the
following form (unless such shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been
transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been
declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues to be effective
at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the exemption from registration
provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force under the
Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation in writing with
written notice thereof to the Transfer Agent):

(b) Any share of Series B Preferred Stock (or security issued in exchange or
substitution therefor) as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have
expired in accordance with their terms may, upon surrender of such share of
Series B Preferred Stock for exchange to the Transfer Agent, be exchanged for
a new share or shares of Series B Preferred Stock, of like aggregate number of

occurrence of the Resale Restriction Termination Date and promptly after a
registration statement, if any, with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock
or Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock has
been declared effective under the Securities Act.

_Exhibit A_, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of
this Certificate of Designations _. _The Series B Preferred Stock
certificate may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law or
stock exchange rules; _provided_ that any such notation, legend or endorsement
is in a form acceptable to the Corporation. Each Series B Preferred Stock
certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication.

 



 

Annex A - 33    

 

 



 

(i) _Global Series B Preferred Stock_ _. _The Series B Preferred Stock
shall be issued initially in the form of one or more fully registered global
certificates with the global securities legend set forth in _Exhibit A_
hereto (the " ** _Global Series B Preferred Stock_**"), which shall be
deposited on behalf of the Holders represented thereby with the Transfer
Agent, as custodian for DTC (or with such other custodian as DTC may direct),
and registered in the name of Cede and Co. or other nominee of DTC, duly
executed by the Corporation and authenticated by the Transfer Agent as
hereinafter provided _. _The number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
represented by Global Series B Preferred Stock may from time to time be

of Cede and Co. as nominee for DTC as depository for such Global Series B

by the Transfer Agent as the custodian of DTC or under such Global Series B

of such Global Series B Preferred Stock for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Corporation,
the Transfer Agent or any agent of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent from

furnished by DTC or impair, as between DTC and its Agent Members, the
operation of customary practices of DTC governing the exercise of the rights
of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Series B Preferred Stock.

_Section 14(a)_ or in _Section 14(c)_, owners of beneficial interests in
Global Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive physical

or an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation, or the Secretary or Assistant
Secretary of the Corporation, shall sign each Series B Preferred Stock
certificate for the Corporation by manual or facsimile signature, and such
certificates may bear the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof.

 



 

If any person who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon
a Series B Preferred Stock certificate on behalf of the Corporation shall have
ceased to be Chairman of the Board or shall have ceased to be an Officer
before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued
by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer at
the date of its issuance.

A Series B Preferred Stock certificate shall not be valid until an authorized
signatory of the Transfer Agent manually signs the certificate of
authentication on the Series B Preferred Stock certificate _. _The signature

been authenticated in accordance with this Certificate of Designations.

 



 

The Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver certificates for up to
62,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for original issue upon a written
order of the Corporation signed by two Officers of the Corporation _. _Such
order shall specify the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be

Preferred Stock is to be authenticated.

 



 

The Transfer Agent may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable
to the Corporation to authenticate the certificates for the Series B Preferred
Stock _. _Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating
agent may authenticate certificates for the Series B Preferred Stock whenever
the Transfer Agent may do so _. _Each reference in this Certificate of
Designations to authentication by the Transfer Agent includes authentication
by such agent _. _An authenticating agent has the same rights as the
