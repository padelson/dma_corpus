iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this _"Agreement"_ ), dated November 2,
2005, is made and entered into by and among MICROSEMI CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), APT ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and ADVANCED POWER
TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation (the _"Company"_ ). Merger Sub and
the Company are sometimes collectively referred to as the " _Constituent
Corporations_."



WITNESSETH:



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
the respective corporations and their stockholders that Merger Sub be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the _"DGCL"_ ) and the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to which the
Company will be the surviving corporation and will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the _"Merger"_ ); and



WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the parties intend
that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the
Code; and



WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection
with, and establish various conditions precedent to, the Merger; and



WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
third parties are concurrently herewith entering into one or more of
the following agreements (collectively the "Ancillary Agreements"): a
Stockholder Voting Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the _"Voting Agreement"_ ); a Non-competition Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Non-competition
Agreement"); a Lock-up Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the "Lock-up Agreement"), a Key-Employee Employment Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Employment
Agreement"), and/or an agreement to induce Parent to assume the outstanding
Company Options under the Company Stock Option Plans in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Option Assumption Agreement").



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and in the Certificate of
Merger (as defined in Section 1.3 hereof), the parties hereto, intending to be
legally bound, agree as follows: 



ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



_1.1 The Merger._ At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3 hereof),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall    continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, in its capacity as the
corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the " _Surviving Corporation_."



_1.2 Effect of Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Surviving Corporation shall succeed to and possess all the properties,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and purposes, and be
subject to all the duties, liabilities, debts, obligations, restrictions and
disabilities, of the Constituent Corporations, all without further act or
deed.



_1.3 Effective Time._  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto will cause the "Certificate of Merger," the form of which
is attached hereto as Exhibit F, to be executed, delivered and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL at the time of the Closing (as defined in Section 1.7
hereof). The Merger shall become effective upon filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
time as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Certificate of
Merger. The time of effectiveness is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_." The day on which the Effective Time shall occur is herein referred to
as the " _Effective Date_."



_1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws._ From and after the Effective Time
and until further amended in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, as amended as set forth in an exhibit to the Certificate of
Merger. From and after the Effective Time and until further amended in
accordance with law, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.



_1.5 Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time, the directors
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the persons who were the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the persons who were the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Said directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall hold office for the term specified in, and
subject to the provisions contained in, the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable law. If, at or after the
Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the Board of Directors or in any of
the offices of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy shall be filled in the
manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.



_1.6 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company, respectively, shall each use its or their commercially reasonable
best efforts to take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the Merger under the DGCL at the time specified in Section 1.3
hereof. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of either
of the Constituent Corporations, the officers of the Surviving Corporation are
fully authorized in the name of each Constituent Corporation or otherwise to
take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.



_1.7 The Closing._ The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Microsemi
Corporation at 2381 Morse Avenue, Irvine,  



 

2  California, 92614, within three (3) business days after the date on which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied
or waived, or at such other place and on such other date as is mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Company (the "Closing Date"). The Closing will be
effective as of the Effective Time.



ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



_2.1 Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below) or the holder
of any options, warrants or other rights to acquire or receive shares of
Company Common Stock, the following shall occur:



(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted
automatically into the right to receive the sum of two dollars ($2.00) in cash
(the "Cash Component"), without interest, plus 0.435 shares (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of common stock, par value $.20 per share, of the Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
above, the aggregate amount of cash received under this Section 2.1 by the
stockholders of the Company who exchange Company Common Stock for Parent
Common Stock in the Merger shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the sum of
(i) such amount of cash plus (ii) the product of (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received in the Merger by
such stockholders multiplied by (B) the closing sale price for a share of
Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Stock Component shall be
increased so as to prevent such a result. All references in this Agreement to
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to
include the corresponding rights to purchase pursuant to the Parent SRP Plan
(defined in Section 4.2 hereof), except where the context otherwise requires.



(b)  _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or Company._ At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.



(c) _Company Stock Option Plans and Warrant._ At the Effective Time, the
Companys 1995 Stock Option Plan and the Companys Advanced Power Technology,
Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option
Plans_ ") and all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding
under the Company Stock Option Plans shall be assumed by Parent in accordance
with Section 2.2 hereof. In addition, at the Effective Time, the Warrant to
Purchase Stock dated February 2002 (the "Warrant") shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof.



(d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, $.01 par value, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation,  



 

3  and the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such
shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.



(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._ The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted in
the event of (i) any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares, adjustment or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time or (ii) any increase in the number of shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted, as-converted basis (i.e., assuming issuance
of all shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise or
conversion of all securities outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time which are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock, whether or not vested), other than increases resulting from
transactions permitted in Section 5.1 hereof, so as to provide holders of
Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, adjustment
or like change or increase.



(f) _Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received
by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash without interest
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the closing sale price for a share of Parent Common Stock
on the Nasdaq National Market on the trading day immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



(g) _Dissenting Shares._  No dissenters rights shall arise in connection
with the Merger pursuant to Section 262(b) of the DGCL which applies to
Company Common Stock.



2.2. Stock Options and Warrant.



(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Option Plans (each, a " _Company
Option_ "), whether vested or unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (each, an "
_Assumed Company Option_ ") to acquire Parent Common Stock, on substantially
the same terms and conditions as the Company Option, including but not limited
to any performance criteria with respect to the Companys business operations
set forth in the applicable stock option agreements as were applicable under
such Company Option. The Assumed Company Options will be calculated based on
an "Implied Exchange Ratio" which shall equal the sum of (A) the Exchange
Ratio plus (B) the quotient equal to dividing the Cash Component per share by
the Parent Common Stocks closing sale price per share on the Effective Date.
The number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable with an Assumed
Company Option shall equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Implied Exchange Ratio, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) above (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock). The per share exercise price of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Company Option
shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by the Implied Exchange Ratio, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(e) above  



 

4  (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Other than pursuant to the terms of
existing commitments (all of which commitments are identified in Section
2.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter) (as defined in the preamble to Article
III hereof), the Company and any Company Stock Option Plan administrator shall
prior to the Effective Time not take any action that will add any benefit to
the Company Options, including to extend the exercise period of any Company
Option or to cause the holder of any Company Option to receive any right to
payment under any circumstances, regardless of whether such circumstances are
to occur before or after the Effective Time, or otherwise modify or amend the
terms of outstanding Company Options.



(b) All outstanding rights of the Company which it may hold immediately prior
to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Repurchase Options_ ") shall continue in effect following the Merger
and shall continue to be exercisable by the Parent upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and the purchase price
per shall be adjusted to reflect the conversion to Parent Common Stock and the
Exchange Ratio.



(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Company Options and to file all documents required to
be filed to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Assumed Company Options to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but subject to Parents blackout
procedures and the Lock-up Agreement, Parent shall file a registration
statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to
the Parent Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Options, and shall use
all commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Assumed Company Options remain outstanding. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall inform in writing the
holders of Company Options of their rights pursuant to the Company Stock
Option Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by Section 2.2(a) hereof), after giving effect to the
Merger and the assumption by Parent of the Company Options as set forth
herein.



(d) In the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of Section 422 of the Code (" _Incentive Stock Options_ "),
the option exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of
the Code to the extent practicable.



(e) Parent will make good faith efforts to ensure, to the extent permitted by
the Code and to the extent required by and subject to the terms of any such
Incentive Stock Options, that Company Options which qualified as Incentive
Stock Options prior to the Closing Date continue to qualify as Incentive Stock
Options of Parent after the Closing.



(f) At the Effective Time, the Warrant shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with Section 1.7.2 of the Warrant.



 

5 2.3. Exchange of Certificates.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a commercial bank,
trust company or other financial institution, which may include Parents
stock transfer agent, to act as the exchange agent (" _Exchange Agent_ ") in
the Merger.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) cash
in an amount sufficient to permit payment of the Cash Component pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.1(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



(c) Promptly, and in any event no later than ten (10) business days after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Cash
Component and a certificate or certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock,
plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(f), to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.3, each Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of
dividends, to evidence the right to receive the number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been so converted and the right to receive an amount of cash in lieu of
the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(f).



(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until
the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.
Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for the Certificate, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(e) None of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official in compliance with any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.



 

6 (f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company represents and warrants to Merger Sub and Parent that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as
set forth in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on
the date hereof (the _"Company Disclosure Letter"_ ) (which Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth the exceptions to the representations and warranties
contained in this Article III with regard only to the Sections corresponding
to the respective captions of the exceptions in the Company Disclosure Letter,
any other Sections expressly referenced by such exceptions, and any additional
Sections only if and to the extent that the context of the Company Disclosure
Letter makes it reasonably apparent that such exceptions apply to such other
Sections in this Article III):



_3.1._ Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a company duly incorporated, validly
existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and each such entity has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, and is qualified to conduct business, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
failures to be so qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable charter document (any such
document of any business entity hereinafter referred to as its "Charter
Document") or its Bylaws, or other applicable organizational document (any
such documents of any business entity hereinafter referred to as its
"Governing Document"). The  



 

7  Company has delivered to Merger Sub accurate and complete copies of the
respective Charter Documents and Governing Documents, as currently in effect,
of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event or
condition that (i) has a material adverse effect on the assets, business or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(other than any such change, effect, event or condition that arises as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby), or (ii) would prevent or
materially impair the Companys ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" when
used with respect to any party means any corporation or other organization,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which such party directly or
indirectly owns or controls at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions.



_3.2._ Capital Stock of Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns, controls or holds with the power to vote, directly or
indirectly, of record, beneficially or otherwise, any share of capital stock
or any equity or ownership interest in any company, corporation, partnership,
association, joint venture, business, trust or other entity, except for the
Subsidiaries described in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section
3.6(a) hereof) or listed in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and except for ownership of securities in any publicly traded company held
for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and comprising less
than five percent of the outstanding stock of such company. Except as set
forth in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company is
directly or indirectly the record and beneficial owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its Subsidiaries and no equity
securities of any of such Subsidiaries are or may be required to be issued by
reason of any options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe for, calls or
commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights
convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of any such
Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which the Company or any such Subsidiary is bound to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of such capital stock or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such shares. Other than as set forth in Section 3.2
of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of such shares so owned by the Company
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by it free and
clear of any claim, lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance of
any kind (collectively "Liens") with respect thereto other than restrictions
on transfer pursuant to applicable securities laws.



_3.3._ Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
19,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value per share (the "Company
Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on November 1, 2005 (the
"Company Measurement Date"), (a) 10,826,064 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, (b) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding, (c) the Company had 116,850 shares of Treasury stock,
and (d) Company Options to purchase 1,533,785 shares of Company Common Stock
had been granted and remained outstanding under the Company Stock Option
Plans, and (e) a warrant to purchase 1,725 shares of Company Common Stock.
Except as permitted by Section 5.1(b), since the Company Measurement Date, no
additional shares in the Company have been issued and no Rights (as defined
below) have been granted. Except as described in the preceding sentence or as
set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other securities or obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote or which are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote on any matter on which
any stockholder of the Company has a right to vote. All issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are  



 

8  duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. There are not as of the date hereof any existing options,
warrants, stock appreciation rights, stock issuance rights, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights which obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, exchange, transfer or sell any
shares of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other
than rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock issuable under the
Company Stock Option Plans ("Rights"). As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, reprice, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to vote or to
dispose of any shares of the capital stock of any of its Subsidiaries.



_3.4._ Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver, and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the necessary
approval of its stockholders, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby under applicable law. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby (other than approval by
the Companys stockholders as required by applicable law). This Agreement and
the agreements contemplated hereby have been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub, each constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
equitable principles.



_3.5. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._



(a) Assuming that all filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals
or waivers thereof have been duly made or obtained as contemplated by Section
3.5(b) hereof, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated
hereby nor compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof will
(i) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or suspension
of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (A) their
respective Charter Documents or Governing Documents, (B) any note, bond,
charge, lien, pledge, mortgage, indenture or deed of trust to which the
Company or any such Subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be subject, or (C) any license, lease,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any such
Subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their respective properties
or assets may be subject, or (ii) violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets,
except, in the case of clauses (i) (B) and (C) and (ii) above, for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, suspensions,
accelerations, rights of termination or acceleration or creations of
liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

9 (b) No filing, registration with or notification to, and, no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of any court, commission, governmental
body, regulatory authority, agency or tribunal wherever located (a "
_Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be obtained, made or given by the
Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation by the Company of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby except (i) (A) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger as provided in Section 1.3 hereof, (B) in connection with the
applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (C) the filing of the _Proxy

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Securities Act_ "), as may be required in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (D) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable state securities laws and the laws of any country
other than the United States, or in any case (ii) where the failure to obtain
any such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.



_3.6. SEC Filings; Financial Statements._



(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed by it since January 1, 2002 to the date hereof
(collectively, as supplemented and amended since the time of filing, the "
_Company SEC Reports_ ") with the SEC. The _Company SEC Reports_ (i) were
prepared in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The representation in clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence does not apply to any misstatement or omission in any
Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement which was
superseded by a subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any report, form
or other document with the SEC. The Company is, and shall at all times prior
to the Effective Time remain, in full compliance with the requirements of the
Securities Exchange Commission, applicable state securities commissions, the
Nasdaq Stock Market and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, including but not
limited to its Section 404, "Management Assessment of Internal Controls."



(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in such Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "
_Financial Statements_ ") have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be otherwise indicated in the notes
thereto) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at the respective dates and for the
respective periods indicated (except, in the case of all such financial
statements that are interim financial statements, for footnotes and normal
year-end adjustments).



(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, un-matured, contingent
or otherwise whether due or to become due, known or unknown, or any
unsatisfied judgments or any leases of personalty  



 

10  or realty or unusual or extraordinary commitments that are required to be
shown on the face of a balance sheet or disclosed in notes to financial
statements under United States generally accepted accounting principles,
except (i) liabilities recorded on the Companys balance sheet at December 31,
2004 (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") included in the financial statements referred
in Section 3.6(a) hereof and the notes thereto, or (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred since December 31, 2004 (whether or not incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice) that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



_3.7._ Absence of Changes or Events. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the
Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC Reports, since December 31,
2004 through the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have not incurred any liability or obligation that has resulted or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
there has not been any change in the business, financial condition or results
of operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
their past practices.



_3.8._ Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or as set
forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no (a) claim,
action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge (as defined in
Section 8.6 hereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened
against or relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (b)
outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree
(collectively, "Orders"), or application, request or motion therefor, in a
proceeding to which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
respective assets was or is a party except actions, suits, proceedings or
Orders that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default in any material respect with
respect to any such Order.



_3.9._ Title to Properties. Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter
includes an accurate list and general description of all real property owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to the real properties that it owns
(the "Owned Real Property") free and clear of all mortgages, covenants,
conditions, restrictions, easements, liens, security interests, charges,
claims, assessments and encumbrances, except for (a) rights of lessors,
lessees or sublessees in such matters that are reflected in a written lease
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter; (b) current taxes (including
assessments collected with taxes) not yet due and payable; (c) encumbrances,
if any, that are not substantial in character, amount or extent and do not
materially detract from the value, or interfere with present use, or the
ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to dispose, of the property subject
thereto or affected thereby; and (d) other matters as described in Section
3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent correct and complete copies of all leases, subleases and
other agreements (collectively, the "Real Property Leases") under which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries uses or occupies or has the right to use or
occupy, now or in the future, any real property or facility (the "Leased Real
Property"), including without limitation all modifications, amendments and
supplements thereto. Except in each case where the failure would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(i) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has a valid leasehold interest in
each parcel of Leased Real Property free and clear of all Liens except liens
of record and other permitted liens and each Real Property Lease is in full
force and effect, (ii) all rent and other sums and charges due and payable by
the Company or its  



 

11  Subsidiaries as tenants thereunder are current in all material respects,
(iii) no termination event or condition or uncured default of a material
nature on the part of the Company or any such Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, the landlord, exists under any Real
Property Lease, (iv) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is in actual
possession of each Leased Real Property and is entitled to quiet enjoyment
thereof in accordance with the terms of the applicable Real Property Lease and
applicable law, and (v) the Company and its Subsidiaries own outright all of
the personal property (except for leased property or assets for which it has
a valid and enforceable right to use) which is reflected on the Balance Sheet,
except for property since sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice and except for liens of record
and other permitted liens. Except where the failure would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the plant, property
and equipment of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are used in the
operations of their businesses are in good operating condition and repair,
subject to ordinary wear and tear, and, subject to normal maintenance, are
available for use.



_3.10._ Certain Contracts. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
breached, or received in writing any claim or notice that it has breached,
any of the terms or conditions of (i) any agreement, contract or commitment
required to be filed as an exhibit to the Company SEC Reports (including any
agreements, contracts or commitments entered into since December 31, 2004
that will be required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in any report),
(ii) any agreements, contracts or commitments with manufacturers, suppliers,
sales representatives, distributors, or original equipment manufacturer
("OEM") strategic partners of the Company pursuant to which the Company
recognized revenues or payments in excess of $250,000 for the twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2004, or (iii) any agreements, contracts
or commitments containing covenants that limit the ability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any Person
(as defined in Section 8.6 hereof), or that include any exclusivity provision
or involve any restriction on the geographic area in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may carry on its business (collectively, "Company Material
Contracts"), in such a manner as, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company Material
Contract described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence. Each
Company Material Contract that has not expired by its terms is in full force
and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries, enforceable against them in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally
and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), except
where the failure of such Company Material Contract to be in full force and
effect or to be legal, valid, binding or enforceable against the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries has not had and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
consent, approval, waiver or authorization of, or notice to any Person is
needed in order that each such Company Material Contract shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms without penalty,
acceleration or rights of early termination by reason of the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except
as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no
agreement, contract, commitment or obligation of any kind that arises by
reason of the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

12 _3.11._ Compliance with Law. Except where the failure would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, all activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are currently being, conducted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable United States federal, state, provincial and
local and other foreign laws, ordinances, regulations, interpretations,
judgments, decrees, injunctions, permits, licenses, certificates, governmental
requirements, and Orders of any court or other Governmental Entity or any
nongovernmental self-regulatory agency, and no notice has been received by
the Company or any Subsidiary of any claims filed against the Company or any
Subsidiary alleging a violation of any such laws, regulations or other
requirements which would be required to be disclosed in any Company SEC
Report or any New SEC Report (as defined in Section 5.16 hereof). The Company
Stock Option Plans have been duly authorized, approved and operated in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable securities, corporate
and other laws of each jurisdiction in which participants of such plans are
located. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and
franchises from Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as
now being conducted, except for such permits, licenses and franchises the
absence of which has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_3.12._ Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and its Subsidiaries own, or
are validly licensed or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to use,
all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names and
copyrights, any applications for and registrations of such patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names and copyrights, and all
database rights, net lists, processes, formulae, methods, schematics,
technology, know-how, computer software programs or applications and tangible
or intangible proprietary information or material that are necessary to
conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, or presently planned to be conducted, except for such rights the
absence of which would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (the "Company Intellectual Property Rights"). The Company and
its Subsidiaries have taken, or are taking (on going matters), all action
reasonably necessary to protect the Company Intellectual Property Rights which
is customary in the industry, including without limitation, use of
reasonable secrecy measures to protect the trade secrets included in the
Company Intellectual Property Rights.



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the breach of, or create
on behalf of any third party the right to terminate or modify, any material
license, sublicense or other agreement relating to the Company Intellectual
Property Rights, or any material licenses, sublicenses or other agreements as
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third
party patents, trademarks, copyrights or trade secrets (" _Company Third-Party
Intellectual Property Rights_ "), including software that is used in the
manufacture of, incorporated in, or forms a part of any product sold by or
expected to be sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the breach of
which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company Disclosure Letter, under the
caption referencing this Section 3.12, lists all royalties, license fees,
sublicense fees or similar obligations requiring payment in excess of
$100,000 per year by the Company or any Subsidiary for any Company Third-Party
Intellectual Property Rights that are used in the manufacture of, incorporated
in, or forms a part of any product sold by or expected to be sold by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(b) All patents, registered trademarks, service marks, domain names and
copyrights which are held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the loss
or invalidity of which  



 

13  would reasonably be expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect, are
in force and are believed to be valid and subsisting. The Company (i) has not
been sued in any unresolved suit, action or proceeding, or received in writing
any claim or notice, which involves a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of any patents, trademarks, service marks, domain names,
copyrights or violation of any trade secret or other proprietary right of any
third party; and (ii) has no Knowledge that the manufacturing, marketing,
licensing or sale of its products or services infringe upon, misappropriate or
otherwise come into conflict with any patent, trademark, service mark,
copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party, which
infringement, misappropriation or conflict in the cases of clause (i) and (ii)
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other
Person has interfered with, infringed upon, or otherwise come into conflict
with any Company Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



(c) Except where the failure to do so would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, to the Companys Knowledge, each employee, agent, consultant
or contractor who has materially contributed to or participated in the
creation or development of any copyrightable, patentable or trade secret
material on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
in interest thereto either: (i) is a party to an agreement under which the
Company or such Subsidiary is deemed to be the original owner/author of all
property rights therein; or (ii) has executed an assignment or an agreement
to assign in favor of the Company, such Subsidiary or such predecessor in
interest, as applicable, all right, title and interest in such material.



(d) Except where the failure to do so would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not suffered any
compromise of data security or any corruption or loss of data.



_3.13._ Taxes.



(a) " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " shall mean all United States federal, state,
provincial, local or foreign taxes and any other applicable duties, levies,
fees, charges and assessments that are in the nature of a tax, including

valorem, value-added, transfer, social security payments, and health taxes
and any deductibles relating to wages, salaries and benefits and payments to

such amounts.

3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter or as could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect:



(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have prepared and timely filed with the
appropriate governmental agencies all franchise, income, sales and all other
material Tax returns and reports required to be filed on or before the
Effective Time (collectively _"Returns"_ ), taking into account any extension
of time to file granted to or obtained on behalf of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries;



 

14 (ii) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries shown on such Returns or
otherwise known by the Company to be due or payable have been timely paid in
full to the proper authorities, other than such Taxes as are being contested

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;



(iii) all deficiencies resulting from Tax examinations of income, sales and
franchise and all other material Returns filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction in which such Returns are required to be so
filed have either been paid or are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings;



(iv) no deficiency has been asserted or assessed against the Company or any of

complete in all material respects or adequate reserves have been established
with respect to any additional Taxes that may be due (or may become due) as a
result of such Returns not being correct or complete;



(vii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no Tax liens have been filed with
respect to any Taxes;

Subsidiaries is liable to be assessed for or made accountable for any Tax for
which any other person or persons may be liable to be assessed or made
accountable whether by virtue of the entering into or the consummation of the
Merger or by virtue of any act or acts done by or which may be done by or any
circumstance or circumstances involving or which may involve any other person
or persons.



(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not parties to any agreement,
contract, or arrangement that would, as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, result, separately or in the aggregate, in (i) the
payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of  



 

15  Section 280G of the Code by reason of the Merger or (ii) the payment of any
form of compensation or reimbursement for any Tax incurred by any Person
arising under Section 280G of the Code.



_3.14._ Employees. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any collective bargaining agreement, arrangement or labor contract with a
labor union or labor organization, whether formal or otherwise. The
Company Disclosure Letter, under the caption referencing this Section 3.14,
lists all employment, severance and change of control agreements (or any other
agreements that may result in the acceleration of outstanding options) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, all
applicable extension orders) respecting employment and employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, equal opportunity, anti-discrimination
laws, and wages and hours, except where such noncompliance has not had and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no labor strike, slowdown or
stoppage pending (or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any unfair labor practice complaints, labor disturbances or
other controversies respecting employment which are pending or threatened
which, if they actually occurred, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect) against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.



_3.15._ Employee Benefit Plans.



(a) " _ERISA_ " means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and "Plan" means every plan, fund, contract, program and arrangement
(whether written or not) which is maintained or contributed to by the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of present or former employees or with
respect to which the Company and its Subsidiaries otherwise has current or
potential liability. Plan includes any arrangement intended to provide: (i)
medical, surgical, health care, hospitalization, dental, vision, workers
compensation, life insurance, death, disability, legal services, severance,
sickness, accident, or cafeteria plan benefits (whether or not defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), (ii) pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, retirement,
supplemental retirement or deferred compensation benefits (whether or not tax
qualified and whether or not defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) bonus,
incentive compensation, stock option, stock appreciation right, phantom stock
or stock purchase benefits, change in control benefits or (iv)
salary continuation, unemployment, supplemental unemployment, termination
pay, vacation or holiday benefits (whether or not defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA). The Company Disclosure Letter, under the caption referencing this
Section 3.15(a), sets forth all material Plans by name and brief description.



(b) To the extent required (either as a matter of law or to obtain the
intended tax treatment and tax benefits), all Plans comply and have complied
with the requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable law, except
where such noncompliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. With respect to the Plans, (i) all required
contributions which are due have been made and an accrual required by
generally accepted accounting principles has been made on the books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries for all future contribution
obligations; (ii) there are no actions, suits or claims pending, other than
routine uncontested claims for benefits; and (iii) there have been no
nonexempt prohibited transactions (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code), except for such transactions, if any, which have
not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter under the caption referencing this
Section 3.15(b), all benefits under the Plans (other than  



 

16  Code Section 125 cafeteria plans) are payable either through a fully-funded
trust or an insurance contract and no welfare benefit Plan (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA) is self-funded.



(c) Parent has received true and complete copies of (i) all Plan documents,
including related trust agreements or funding arrangements; (ii) the most
recent determination letter, if any, received by the Company or its
Subsidiaries from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") regarding the
Plans and any amendment to any Plan made subsequent to any Plan amendments
covered by any such determination letter; (iii) current summary plan
descriptions; and (iv) annual returns/reports on Form 5500 and summary annual
reports for the most recent plan year. To the Knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred that could materially adversely affect the qualification
of the Plans and their related trusts under Section 401(a) of the Code.



(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company does not maintain or contribute to (and has never contributed to) any
multi-employer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or potential material
liabilities under Title IV of ERISA, including under Section 4201 of ERISA for
any complete or partial withdrawal from a multi-employer plan.



(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or potential
material liability for death or medical benefits after separation from
employment, other than (i) death benefits under the employee benefit plans
or programs (whether or not subject to ERISA) set forth in Section 3.15 of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) health care continuation benefits
described in Section 4980B of the Code or similar requirements under
applicable state law.



(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or other "fiduciaries," as such term
is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA, has committed any breach of fiduciary
responsibility imposed by ERISA or any other applicable law with respect to
the Plans which would subject the Company, Parent or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees to any liability under ERISA or any
applicable law, except for such breaches, if any, which have not had
and would not, individual or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(g) There are no other trades or businesses (other than Subsidiaries of the
Company), whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company,
would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Code Sections
414(b), (c) or (m).



(h) Except with respect to Taxes on benefits paid or provided, no Tax has been
waived or excused, has been paid or is owed by any person (including, but not
limited to, any Plan, any Plan fiduciary or the Company) with respect to the
operations of, or any transactions with respect to, any Plan which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No action has been taken by the Company, nor
has there been any failure by the Company to take any action, nor is any
action or failure to take action contemplated by the Company (including all
actions contemplated under this Agreement), that would subject any person or
entity to any liability or Tax imposed by the IRS or the U.S. Department of
Labor in connection with any Plan, except for such liability or Tax that has
not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No reserve for any Taxes
has been established with respect to any Plan by the Company nor has any
advice been given to the Company with respect to the need to establish such a
reserve, except for  



 

17  such reserves which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(i) There are no (i) legal, administrative or other proceedings or
governmental investigations or audits, or (ii) complaints to or by any
Governmental Entity, which are pending, anticipated or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, against any Plan or its assets, or against any
Plan fiduciary or administrator, or against the Company or its officers or
employees with respect to any Plan which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(j) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there are no leased employees, as defined in Section 414(n) of the Code,
providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries, that must be taken into
account with respect to the requirements under Section 414(n)(3) of the Code.



(k) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
each Plan may be terminated directly or indirectly by Parent and the Company,
in their sole discretion, at any time before or after the Effective Date in
accordance with its terms, without causing the Parent or the Company to incur
any liability to any person, entity or government agency for any conduct,
practice or omission of the Company which occurred prior to the Effective
Date, except for (i) liabilities to, and the rights of, the employees
thereunder accrued prior to the Effective Date, or if later, the time of
termination, (ii) continuation rights required by the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or other applicable law,
and (iii) liabilities which would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

presently complying in all material respects with all applicable health,
safety and Environmental Laws (as defined below), and (ii) have obtained all
material permits, licenses and authorizations which are required under all
applicable health, safety and Environmental Laws and are in compliance in all
material respects with such permits, licenses and authorizations, except in
each case for such failure to comply or to obtain permits, licenses or
authorizations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, (i) none of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property

contaminated with any Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 3.16(b)
hereof) in quantities which require investigation or remediation under
Environmental Laws, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
liable for any off-site contamination, and (iii) there is no environmental
matter which could reasonably be expected to expose the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a claim to cleanup any Hazardous Materials or otherwise to
remedy any pollution or damage at any of the properties utilized in the
Companys business under any Environmental Laws, that would, with respect to
any of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, be required to be disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term (i) " _Environmental Laws_ "
means all applicable United States federal, state, provincial, local and
other foreign laws, rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, orders, decrees,
directives, permits, licenses and judgments relating to pollution,
contamination or protection of the environment (including,
without limitation, all applicable United States federal, state, provincial,
local and other foreign laws, rules, regulations, codes, ordinances,  



 

18  orders, decrees, directives, permits, licenses and judgments relating to
Hazardous Materials in effect as of the date of this Agreement), and (ii) "

safety, including without limitation any waste, material, substance, pollutant

each of the insurance policies currently in force with respect to the business
and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
and, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has failed to give any notice or to
present any such claim with respect to its business under any such policy in
due and timely fashion, except where such failure would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



_3.18._ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (nor any person representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) has at any time during the last five years (a) made any payment
in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other
countries where the Company engages in business, or (b) made any payment to

20 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MERGER SUB AND PARENT



Merger Sub and Parent jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct,
except as set forth in the letter delivered by Merger Sub and Parent to the
Company on the date hereof (the _"Parent Disclosure Letter"_ ) (which Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth the exceptions to the representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV with regard only to the Sections
corresponding to the respective caption in the Parent Disclosure Letter, any
other Sections expressly referenced by such exceptions and any additional
Sections only if and to the extent that the context of the Parent Disclosure
Letter makes it reasonably apparent that such exceptions apply to such other
Sections in this Article IV):



_4.1._ Organization and Qualification. Parent is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, with the corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Merger Sub is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Merger Sub and Parent is duly qualified
or licensed to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
qualified to conduct business, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for failures to be so qualified that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any of the provisions of its Charter
Document or its Governing Document. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event or condition
that (i) has a material adverse effect on the assets, business or financial
condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) would
prevent or materially delay Merger Subs or Parents ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.



_4.2._ Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.20 par value per share, and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share (of which
100,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
the "Parent Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on November 1,
2005 (the "Parent Measurement Date"), (a) 63,574,526 shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, (b) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock
were issued and outstanding, (c) 15,011,443 shares of Parent Common Stock
were reserved for issuance under the 1987 Stock Plan of the Parent (the
"Parent Stock Plan"), (d) options to purchase 11,958,035 shares of Parent
Common Stock in the aggregate had been granted and remained outstanding under
the Parent Stock Plan, and (e) rights to acquire shares or property pursuant
to the Microsemi Corporation Shareholder Rights Plan, dated as of December 22,
2000, as amended, between Parent and Mellon Investor Services LLC (the
"Parent SRP Plan"), there were no outstanding Parent Rights (as defined
below). Since the Parent Measurement Date, no additional shares of Parent
Common Stock have been issued and are outstanding, except pursuant to the
exercise of options, and no Parent Rights have been granted. All issued and
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights created by the DGCL
or Parents Charter Document or Governing Document, or any other agreement
with the Company. There are not at the date of this Agreement any existing
options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or
other rights which obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
exchange, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under the
Parent Stock Plan, or awards granted pursuant thereto, and other than  



 

21  Parent SRP Plan rights issued along with all past and future issuances of
shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, "Parent Rights"). 



_4.3._ Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver, and to
perform its obligations under, this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the
necessary approval of its stockholders, to consummate the Merger and
the other provisions contemplated hereby under applicable law. The execution
and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger
Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or other
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, is a
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
them in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles. The shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent pursuant to the Merger, as well as
the Assumed Company Options and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
upon exercise thereof: (i) have been duly authorized, and, when issued in
accordance with the terms of the Merger and this Agreement (or the applicable
option agreements), will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
will not be subject to preemptive rights, (ii) will, when issued in
accordance with the terms of the Merger and this Agreement (or the applicable
option agreements), be registered under the Securities Act, and registered or

Agreement (or the applicable option agreements), be listed on the Nasdaq
National Market and (iv) will be issued free and clear of any Liens.



_4.4._ No Conflicts; Required Filings and Consents.



(a) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
Merger Sub or Parent, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Merger Sub or Parent with any provision hereof will
(i) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of
the Charter Documents or Governing Documents of Merger Sub or Parent, (ii)
cause a default or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of
any lien, charge or other encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of

note, license, bond, deed of trust, mortgage or indenture, or any other
material instrument, obligation or agreement to which Merger Sub or Parent is
a party or by which its properties or assets may be bound or (iii) violate any
law, judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to Merger Sub or Parent or binding upon any of its
properties, except for, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), such defaults
or violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



(b) No filing or registration with or notification to and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Entity is required to
be obtained, made or given by Merger Sub or Parent in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Merger Sub of
the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby except (i) (A) in
connection with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (B) the filing of
a Registration Statement (defined  



 

22  in Section 3.26 hereof) with the SEC, in accordance with the Securities Act,
as further described in Section 3.26 hereof or (C) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable state securities laws and the laws of any country
other than the United States, or (ii) where the failure to obtain any
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



_4.5._ SEC Filings; Financial Statements.



(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed by it since January 1, 2003 to the date hereof
(collectively, as supplemented and amended since the time of filing, the "
_Parent SEC Reports_ ") with the SEC. The Parent SEC Reports (i) were
prepared in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The representation in clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence does not apply to any misstatement or omission in any
Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement which was
superseded by a subsequent Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement.



(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in such Parent SEC Reports have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
otherwise be indicated in the notes thereto) and present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash
flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at the
respective dates and for the respective periods indicated (except, in the case
of all such financial statements that are interim financial statements, for
normal year-end adjustments).



(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, unmatured, contingent or
otherwise, whether due or to become due, known or unknown, or any unsatisfied
judgments or any leases of personalty or realty or unusual or
extraordinary commitments that are required to be disclosed under United
States generally accepted accounting principles, except (i) as set forth in
the Parent SEC Reports, (ii) the liabilities recorded on Parents consolidated
balance sheet at September 26, 2004 included in the financial statements
referred in Section 4.5(a) hereof and the notes thereto, (iii) liabilities or
obligations incurred since September 26, 2004 (whether or not incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice) that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) liabilities that would not be required by
United States generally accepted accounting principles to be disclosed in
financial statements or in the notes thereto and that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.



_4.6._ Absence of Changes or Events. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC
Reports, since December 31, 2004 through the date of this Agreement, Parent
and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability or obligation outside the
ordinary course of business, nor has any event occurred or action been
threatened, that has resulted or would reasonably likely be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



 

23 _4.7._ Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, there is no
(i) claim, action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii)
outstanding Orders, or application, request or motion therefor, in a
proceeding to which Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any of their
respective assets was or is a party except actions, suits, proceedings or
Orders that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither
Parent nor any Subsidiary is in default in any material respect with respect
to any such Order.



_4.8._ Compliance with Law. All activities of Merger Sub and Parent have been,
and are currently being, conducted in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable United States federal, state and local and other foreign
laws, ordinances, regulations, interpretations, judgments, decrees,
injunctions, permits, licenses, certificates, governmental requirements,
Orders and other similar items of any court or other Governmental Entity or
any nongovernmental self-regulatory agency, and no notice has been received by
Parent of any claims filed against either Merger Sub or Parent alleging a
violation of any such laws, regulations or other requirements which would be
required to be disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. Merger Sub and Parent have
all permits, licenses and franchises from Governmental Entities required to
conduct their businesses as now being conducted, except for such permits,
licenses and franchises the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



_4.9._ Finders or Brokers. Except for Lehman Brothers, whose fees will be
paid by Parent, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the other Subsidiaries of Parent,
the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub or any member of such Boards
of Directors has employed any agent, investment banker, broker, finder or
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby who
might be entitled to a fee or any commission in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby.



_4.10._ Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor, to its Knowledge, any of its
affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, or knows of any
circumstances, that (without regard to any action taken or agreed to be taken
by the Company or any of its affiliates) would prevent the business
combination to be effected by the Merger from constituting a
transaction qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code.



_4.11._ Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information
supplied by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the time the Registration
Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) is declared
effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the
Companys stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and
at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which it is made, not false or misleading; or omit to
state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any event or information should be discovered by
Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy  



 

24  Statement/Prospectus, Parent or Merger Sub will promptly inform the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied
by the Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

course of business consistent with past practice; or



(o) agree or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to

Sky Laws. As promptly as practicable and no later than twenty (20) business
days after the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent
shall file with the SEC, the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as part thereof. Parent and the Company
shall use all commercially reasonable best efforts to have such Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after filing. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, when
prepared pursuant to this Section 5.2 and mailed to the Companys
stockholders, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall be reviewed and approved by Parent and Parents counsel prior to the
mailing of such Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the Companys stockholders.
Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable
provincial or state securities laws (including "Blue Sky" laws) in connection
with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger; provided, however,
that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to register or qualify
as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to
service of process in any jurisdiction where any such entity is not now so
subject, except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the offer
and sale of Parent Common Stock or the Assumed Company Options. 



_5.3._ Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall, promptly after the
date hereof, take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to convene the Company Stockholders
Meeting within 45 days of the Registration Statement being declared
effective by the SEC, whether or not the Company Board determines at any time
after the date hereof that the Merger is no longer advisable. The adoption of
the Merger by  



 

27  the stockholders of the Company shall be recommended by the Company Board
unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation
with outside counsel, taking such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law. The Company Stockholders Meeting
will be convened, held and conducted, and any proxies will be solicited, in
compliance with the DGCL and applicable securities laws. The Company shall
consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Subject to Section 5.2 and Section 5.6 hereof, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other commercially
reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
stockholders required to effect the Merger.



_5.4. Additional Agreements; Cooperation._



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
cooperate, subject to compliance with applicable law, with each other in
connection with the foregoing, including using its commercially reasonable
best efforts (i) to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from
other parties to loan agreements, material leases and other material
contracts, (ii) to obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations
as are required to be obtained under any United States federal or state,
foreign law or regulations, (iii) to defend all lawsuits or other legal
proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining
order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (v) to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and submissions of information requested
by Governmental Entities, and (vi) to fulfill all conditions to this
Agreement.



(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees, subject to compliance with applicable
law, to furnish to each other party hereto such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions to any regulatory or
governmental agency or authority, including, without limitation, any filing
necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act, the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or any other United States federal or state, or foreign statute
or regulation. Each party hereto shall promptly inform each other party of any
material communication from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any other
government or governmental authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



_5.5. Publicity_. Parent and the Company will mutually consult concerning the
news release first announcing this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which shall be a joint news release.
Neither party shall issue any such news release or other announcement without
the consent of the other party. Thereafter, without the consent of the Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries will not, and will not permit any of their respective
affiliates or representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any news
release or make any other public announcement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as otherwise required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the
Nasdaq Stock Market, in which case the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to consult with Parent and to provide
Parent with a copy of such news release or other announcement and afford
Parent the opportunity to comment thereon prior to publication.



 

28 _5.6. No Solicitation._



(a) Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall (and shall
cause its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and
other agents or representatives to) cease all discussions, negotiations,
responses to inquiries (except as set forth in the proviso to this sentence)
and other communications relating to any potential business combination with
all third parties who, prior to the date hereof, may have expressed or
otherwise indicated any interest in pursuing an Acquisition Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) with the Company; provided that, this Section 5.6(a)
shall not prohibit activities permitted by Section 5.6(b) in response to an
inquiry initiated after the date hereof.



(b) Prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII hereof, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall the Company authorize or
permit any officers, directors or employees of, or any investment bankers,
attorneys or other agents or representatives retained by or acting on behalf
of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) initiate, solicit
or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate
in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information or data to, or
take any other action to, facilitate any inquiries or making any proposal by,
any third party relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any possible Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6 or in any other
provision of this Agreement, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Company Board may participate in discussions or negotiations with or furnish
information to any third party making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (a "
_Potential Acquiror_ ") or approve or recommend an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal if (A) a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor, that a Potential Acquiror has submitted to the Company a written
Acquisition Proposal which sets forth a price or range of values to be paid by
the Potential Acquiror and which, if consummated, would be more favorable to
the Companys stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger
(a "Superior Proposal"), (B) the Company Board has determined in good faith,
based on consultation with independent financial advisor(s), that such
Potential Acquiror is financially capable of consummating such Superior
Proposal, and (C) a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company
Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from reputable outside
legal counsel experienced in such matters (and the parties hereto agree that
the law firm of Davis Wright and Tremaine LLP is so experienced), that the
failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such
information or to approve or recommend such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
is inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
law. In the event that the Company shall receive any Acquisition Proposal, it
shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after
receipt thereof) furnish to Parent the identity of the recipient of the
Acquisition Proposal and of the Potential Acquiror, the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, copies of such Acquisition Proposal and all information
requested by the Potential Acquiror, and shall further promptly inform
Parent in writing as to the fact such information is to be provided after
compliance with the terms of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not provide any non-public information to any
such Potential Acquiror unless (1) it has prior to the date thereof provided
such information to Parent and Merger Sub, and (2) the Company provides such
non-public information pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement with terms that
are at least as restrictive as those pursuant to the Confidential Disclosure
Agreement (the " _Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement_ "), dated November 12,
2004, between Parent and the Company. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
the Company  



 

29  from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after receiving advice from reputable outside legal counsel experienced
in such matters (and the parties hereto agree that the law firm of Davis
Wright and Tremaine LLP is so experienced), such disclosure is required by
applicable law. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not enter into
any agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal for a period of not less than
five (5) days after the Parents receipt of a copy of the Acquisition
Proposal. Further, Parent has the right to match or better any Superior
Proposal of which it has been notified. New proposals from the third party may
be made, and Parent retains the same rights set forth above regarding such
new proposals. If the Parent has not notified Company of its decision to match
or better the Superior Proposal by the eleventh day after Companys
notification is received by Parent that the acquisition proposal is a
Superior Proposal, Company may pay the Parent Termination Fee and terminate
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and proceed with the Superior
Proposal. If Parent notifies Company that it will match or better a Superior
Proposal, this Agreement must be amended to reflect the matched or bettered
terms within two (2) days of Parents decision to so match or better the
Superior Proposal. Upon such amendment, Company may not terminate this
Agreement and must notify the party making the Superior Proposal that such
proposal has been matched or bettered and that this Agreement has been amended
to reflect this fact. After such amendment to this Agreement, Company must,
and must cause Company Bank and its representatives to, cease and terminate
all discussions and negotiations regarding the previous Superior Proposal,
unless a new Acquisition Proposal is received that is determined to be a
Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 5.6. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company understands and agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6(b) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or by any director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.6(b) sufficient to enable Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i) hereof.



(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean
any proposal, whether in writing or otherwise, made by any person other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries to acquire "beneficial ownership" (as defined
under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
assets of, or twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding capital stock
of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation,
exchange of shares or other business combination, sale of shares of capital
stock, sales of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries.



_5.7._ Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, and upon reasonable notice, the Company will give Parent and
its authorized representatives (including counsel, other consultants,
accountants and auditors), to the extent it has the legal authority to do so,
reasonable access during normal business hours to all real properties
presently or formerly operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries, all
facilities, personnel and operations and to all books and records of it and
its Subsidiaries, will permit Parent to make such inspections, investigations
and testing as it may reasonably require, including upon request Phase II
environmental investigations, will cause its officers and those of its
Subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to its business and properties as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request and confer with Parent to keep it
reasonably informed with respect to operational and other business matters
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the status of satisfaction of
conditions to the Closing, other than information that may not be disclosed
under  



 

30  applicable law or in violation of an agreement or if such disclosure would
result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege; provided, however, that
in any such event the parties shall cooperate in good faith to obtain waivers
of such prohibitions or implement alternative methods of disclosure of
material information. All information obtained by Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.7 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Reciprocal
Confidentiality Agreement.



_5.8._ Notification of Certain Matters. The Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other of (a) its obtaining of Knowledge as to
the matters set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, or (b) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur would be likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time
from the date hereof to the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee
or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iii)
the institution of any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
related to the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations
or warranties of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder.



 

 _5.9._ Resignation of Officers and Directors. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent the resignations of all officers
and directors of the Company and shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent the resignations of such officers and directors
of its Subsidiaries (in each case, in their capacities as officers and
directors, but not as employees if any of such persons are employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary), except as Parent may specify, which resignations
shall be effective at the Effective Time.



_5.10. Indemnification._



(a) As of the Effective Time and for a period of ten (10) years following the
Effective Time, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless from and against all
claims, damages, losses, obligations or liabilities (" _Losses_ ") any persons
who were directors or officers of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the fullest extent such
person could have been indemnified for such Losses under applicable law, under
the Governing Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary or under the
indemnification agreements listed on Schedule 5.10 in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof, with respect to any act or failure to
act by any such Indemnified Person at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).



(b) Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
DGCL or other applicable law shall be made by independent counsel selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Persons. Parent shall
pay such counsels fees and expenses (so long as the Indemnified Persons do
not challenge any such determination by such independent counsel).



(c) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with, merges or otherwise enters a business combination into or
with any other person, and Parent or such successor or assign is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or
business combination, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that such person or the continuing or surviving
corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10 and  



 

31  none of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be
consummated until such provision is made.



(d) The Company represents to Parent that the amount per annum the Company
paid for the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company (the "DandO Policy") for the current policy year (the
"Annual Premium") is as set forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either:



(i) maintain the DandO Policy in effect for not less than six years from the
Effective Time (provided that Parent may substitute therefor, through brokers
of its choice, policies of at least comparable coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons in all
material respects so long as no lapse in coverage occurs as a result of such
substitution) with respect to all matters (including, without limitation,
extended reporting endorsements (tail coverage) on fiduciary liability with
respect to all senior officers and directors of the Company), including the
transactions contemplated hereby, occurring prior to, and including the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, in the event that any claim for any losses is
asserted or made within such six-year period, such insurance shall be
continued in respect of any such Claim until final disposition of any and all
such Claims; and _provided, further,_ that Parent shall not be obligated to
make aggregate premium payments for such insurance to the extent such annual
premiums in the aggregate exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the Annual
Premium. In such case, Parent shall purchase only as much coverage as possible
for aggregately two hundred percent (200%) of the Annual Premium; or



(ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu thereof, prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent may arrange for and purchase through brokers of
its choice a directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff"
insurance program, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Company, effective as of the Effective Time, to extend the reporting
period for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, with
such coverage to have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such
policy in an amount at least equal to the annual aggregate coverage limits
under the DandO Policy; _provided_ that the aggregate premium for such coverage
shall not exceed two (2) times the Annual Premium. In the event that the
Parent purchases such a "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" or "runoff"
policy for so long as such "tail" or "runoff" policy shall be maintained in
full force and effect in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.10(d).



Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed in breach of
their obligations to maintain any insurance policy pursuant to this Section
5.10(d) as to any Indemnified Party that is denied coverage under such
insurance policy by the issuer or underwriter thereof as a result of any act
or omission of an Indemnified Person in connection with either the
application for any insurance policy or any claim thereunder.



(e) In the event any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a
"Claim") for which indemnification is provided under this Section 5.10 is
brought against an Indemnified Person (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time) after the Effective Time Parent shall, consistent with the
terms of any directors and officers liability insurance policy, defend such
Indemnified Person from such claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Person; _provided, however_ , that in the event Parent fails to
provide a defense to such Claim or it would be  



 

32  inappropriate due to conflicts of interests that counsel for Parent also
represent such Indemnified Person, (i) such Indemnified Person may
retain separate counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, (ii) the
indemnifying party shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for such Indemnified Person as statements therefor are received, and (iii) the
indemnifying party will use all commercially reasonable best efforts to
assist in the defense of any such matter, provided that the indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any Claim without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and provided
further, however, that not more than one such separate counsel may be retained
for all Indemnified Persons at the expense of the indemnifying party (unless,
and to the extent that, the joint representation of all Indemnified Persons
poses an actual conflict of interest). Any Indemnified Person desiring to
claim indemnification under this Section 5.10, upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify the indemnifying party (but the failure to so notify shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under
this Section 5.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
indemnifying party).



(f) This Section 5.10 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons, shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives.



_5.11._ Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of any stockholder litigation
against or in the name of the Company and/or its respective directors relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



_5.12. Employee Benefit Plans._



(a) _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall take the following steps with respect to
the ADVANCED POWER TECHNOLOGY, INC. Salary Savings Plan (401(k) Plan): at
least three days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the
401(k) Plan pursuant to written resolutions, the form and substance of which
shall be satisfactory to Parent. Individuals employed by the Company at the
Effective Time ("Company Employees") shall be allowed to participate in
Parents 401(k) plan effective as of the first payroll following the
Effective Time; and all service with the Company shall be considered service
with Parent for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, and benefit
accrual (i.e., any matching contributions) under Parents 401(k) plan. As
soon as administratively feasible after assets are distributed from the 401(k)
Plan, Company Employees shall be offered an opportunity to roll their 401(k)
Plan account balances into Parents 401(k) Plan.



(b) _Welfare Plans_. Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in
Parents disability plans, group life insurance plan, medical plan, dental
plan, and Section 125 cafeteria plan as soon as administratively feasible
after the Effective Time. Prior to such time, Company Employees shall remain
eligible for the Companys welfare plans, as applicable, and such plans will
not be amended or changed in any material respect by Parent or the Company.
Parent shall include service and prior earnings with the Company for
purposes of determining eligibility, participation, and benefit accrual under
its short term disability plan, group life insurance plan medical plan, dental

Company shall have delivered to Parent all of the following:



(i) a certificate of the President and the Chief Financial Officer of the

substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent with the state
of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be treated for

of the Company pursuant to the Merger will include the period during which the
Company Common Stock surrendered therefor was held, provided the Company
Common Stock is a capital asset in the hands of the stockholder of the
Company at the time of the Merger.



Parent and the Company shall each provide reasonable cooperation, including
making reasonable representations, to Davis Wright and Tremaine LLP, to enable
them to render such opinion.

43 EXHIBIT A

 



VOTING AGREEMENT



This Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
November ___, 2005 by and between Marines Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and the signatory hereto (the "Promissor"). Terms used herein and
not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement
(as defined below).



RECITALS



WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November
__, 2005, as may be amended from time to time (including such amendments,
herein called the _"Merger Agreement"_ ) by and among Parent, Army Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the
"Merger Sub"), and Army, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), it is
proposed that Parent shall issue shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Parent
Stock Options in exchange for Shares and Options (as defined below) pursuant
to the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"); and



WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent has required that each Promissor, in each such persons
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, enter into, and the Promissor has
agreed to enter into, this Voting Agreement.



AGREEMENT



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable considerations, receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:



1\. _Representations and Warranties of the Promissor_. The Promissor hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:



(a) _Authority; No Violation_. The Promissor has all necessary power and
authority to enter into and perform all of such Promissors obligations
hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Promissor will not violate any other agreement to which such Promissor is a
party, including any voting agreement, stockholder agreement, trust agreement
or voting trust. This Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Promissor (and the Promissors spouse, if the Shares
constitute community property) and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of the Promissor and such spouse, enforceable against the Promissor and the
Promissors spouse, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms.



(b) _Ownership of Shares_. The Promissor is the beneficial owner or record
holder of the number of shares of the Companys Common Stock indicated under
the Promissors name on the signature page hereto (the "Existing Shares," and
together with any shares of the Companys Common Stock acquired by the
Promissor after the date hereof the "Shares") and, as of the date hereof, the
Existing Shares constitute all of the shares of the Companys Common Stock
owned of record or beneficially by the Promissor. With respect to the Existing

has sole voting power and sole power to issue instructions  



 

1  with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2 hereof, sole power of
disposition, sole power to demand appraisal rights and sole power to engage
in actions set forth in Section 2 hereof, with no restrictions on the voting
rights, rights of disposition or otherwise, subject to applicable laws and the
terms of this Agreement.



(c) _No Conflicts_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation by the Promissor of the transactions contemplated hereby
will conflict with or constitute a violation of or default under any contract,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which such
Promissor is a party or by which the Promissor is bound.



2\. _Voting Agreement and Agreement Not to Transfer_.



(a) The Promissor hereby agrees to vote all of the Shares held by the
Promissor (i) in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) against any action or
agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement; and (iii) except with the prior
written consent of Parent, against the following actions (other than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (A) any
extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company; (B) any sale, lease or transfer of
a material amount of the assets of the Company; (C) any change in the
majority of the Board of the Company; (D) any material change in the present
capitalization of the Company; (E) any amendment of the Companys Articles
of Incorporation; (F) any other material change in the Companys corporate
structure or business; or (G) any other action which is intended, or could
reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage
or materially adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to Parent
or Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The
Promissor shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with any person
or entity prior to the Termination Date (as defined below) to vote or give
instructions after the Termination Date in any manner inconsistent with
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence.



(b) The Promissor hereby agrees not to (i) sell, transfer, assign or
otherwise dispose of any of his or her Shares without the prior written
consent of Parent, other than Shares sold or surrendered to pay the exercise
price of any stock options or to pay taxes or satisfy the
Companys withholding obligations with respect to any taxes resulting from
such exercise or (ii) pledge, mortgage or encumber such Shares. Any permitted
transferee of Shares must become a party to this Agreement and any purported
transfer of Shares to a person or entity that has not become a party hereto
shall be null and void.



3\. _Cooperation_. The Promissor agrees that he or she will not, subject to
Section 4, directly or indirectly solicit any inquiries or proposals from any
person relating to any proposal or transaction for the disposition of the
business or assets of the Company or the acquisition of voting securities of
the Company or any business combination between the Company or any person
other than Parent.



4\. _Promissor Capacity_. The Promissor is entering this Agreement in his or
her capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Shares, and not in his
or her capacity as a director/executive officer of the Company. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed in any  



 

2  manner to limit the discretion of any Promissor to take any action, or fail
to take any action, in his or her capacity as a director/executive officer of
the Company, that may be required of such Promissor in the exercise of his or
her duties and responsibilities.



5\. _Termination_. The obligations of the Promissor hereunder shall terminate
upon the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is not consummated, the
obligations of the Promissor hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
the Merger Agreement, _provided_ that if, in the event of such termination,
the Company is required to pay Parent the Termination Fee specified
in Section 7.3(c) of the Merger Agreement, those obligations set forth in
Section 2(a) of this Agreement shall survive until the Company pays the
Termination Fee to Parent. The "Termination Date" for any particular
provision hereunder shall be the date of termination of the Promissors
obligations for such provision.



6\. _Specific Performance_. The Promissor acknowledges that damages would be
an inadequate remedy to Parent for an actual or prospective breach of this
Agreement and that the obligations of the Promissor hereto shall be
specifically enforceable. Each of the parties hereto recognizes and
acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement by the Promisor will cause Parent to sustain damages for which it
would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore each
of the parties hereto agrees that in the event of any such breach Parent shall
be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and
agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.



7\. _Miscellaneous_.



(a) Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or
waived with the written consent of the parties or their respective successors
and assigns. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section
7(a) shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.



(b) Governing Law. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant
hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed,
construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

 



(c) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one instrument.



(d) Titles and Subtitles. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are
used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement.



(e) Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received (i) when delivered by
hand; (ii) on the day sent by facsimile, provided that the sender has
received confirmation of transmission as of or prior to 5:00 p.m. local time
of the recipient, on such day; (iii) the first business day after sent by
facsimile (to the extent that (A) the sender has received confirmation of
transmission after 5:00 p.m. local time of the recipient on the day sent by
facsimile, or  



 

3  (B) notice is sent on a day that is not a business day); or (iv) the third
business day after sent by registered mail or by courier or express
delivery service, in each case to the address or facsimile number set forth
on the signature page to this Agreement beneath the name of such party, or to

proceeding by the delivery of notice as provided in this Agreement, such
service to become effective thirty (30) days after such delivery.

NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT



This Non-competition Agreement (this "Agreement") is dated as of November _
_, 2005, among Marines Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent") Army,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and  _ _ (the
"Obligor"). Terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning
set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).



RECITALS



WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November  _
_, 2005, as may be amended from time to time (including such amendments,
herein called the _"Merger Agreement"_ ) by and among Parent, Army Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Company, it is proposed that Parent shall issue shares of Parent
Common Stock and/or Parent Stock Options (the "New Shares") in exchange for
issued shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below) (the "Shares") and
options to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Options") pursuant to the
Merger Agreement; and



WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent consummating the Merger,
Parent has required that Obligor enter into this Agreement; and



WHEREAS, the Obligor is a stockholder of the Company; and



WHEREAS, in order to induce the Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement
and to minimize the risk that the Parent will lose the benefits of the
goodwill and other assets being acquired from the Merger Sub, the Obligor has
agreed to restrict his/her activities in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. 



AGREEMENT



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of and sufficiency of which
the parties hereto hereby acknowledge, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:



1. _ Definitions._ As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 



(a) "Restricted Business" shall mean any activity customarily associated with
Advanced Power Technologys ordinary course of business.



(b) "Restricted Territory" shall mean the global geographic area.



2. _ Agreement Not To Compete._



(a) _ Agreement._ The Obligor agrees that for a two-year period from the
date of this Agreement through the date that is the second anniversary of the
Effective Date, Obligor shall  



 

1  not directly or indirectly engage in or have any ownership interest in, or
participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any
person, firm, corporation or business that engages in a Restricted Business
in a Restricted Territory, _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit
the Obligor from owning up to five percent (5%) of any class of outstanding
bonds, preferred stock or shares of common stock of any such entity.



(b)  _Confidential Information_. The Obligor hereby acknowledges that he/she
makes use of, acquires and adds to confidential information of a special and
unique nature and value relating to the Merger Sub and its strategic plan and
financial operations. The Obligor further recognizes and acknowledges that
all confidential information is the exclusive property of Merger Sub, is
material and confidential, and is critical to the successful conduct of the
business of Merger Sub. Accordingly, the Obligor hereby covenants and agrees
that he will use confidential information for the benefit of the Merger Sub
only and shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, during the term of
this Agreement and thereafter divulge, reveal or communicate any confidential
information to any person, firm, corporation or entity whatsoever, or use any
confidential information for his own benefit or for the benefit of others.



(c) _ Separate Covenants._ If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall
refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof)
contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2, the parties agree to
renegotiate such provision in good faith, in order to maintain the economic
position enjoyed by each party as closely as possible to that under the
provision rendered unenforceable. In the event that the parties cannot reach a
mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i)
such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the
Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii)
the balance of the Agreement shall be valid and enforceable in accordance with
its terms. Each provision of this Agreement is separable from any
other provisions of this Agreement, and each part of each provision of this
Agreement is severable from every other part of such provision.



(d) _ Reformation._ In the event that the provisions of this Section 2 should
ever be deemed to exceed the duration or geographic limitations or scope
permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the
maximum time or geographic limitations or scope, as the case may be, permitted
by applicable laws.



(e) _ Injuntions; Specific Performance._ The Obligor acknowledges that it
would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from
any breach of any of the provisions of this Section 2 and that the remedy at
law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would
likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the Parent or the Company
shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be
entitled to seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from
any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the Obligor from violating
any of such provisions of this Agreement or to cause the Obligor to perform
any of such provisions. In connection with any action or proceeding for
injunctive relief, the Obligor hereby waives the claim or defense that a
remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, to have each such provision of this Section 2 specifically enforced
against the Obligor, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against the Obligor, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against
the Obligor enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such
provisions of this Section 2\.



 

2 3. _ Miscellaneous._



(a) Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or
waived with the written consent of the parties or their respective successors
and assigns. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section
3(a) shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.



(b) Governing Law. This Agreement and all acts and transactions
pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be
governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.



(c) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one instrument.



(d) Titles and Subtitles. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are
used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing
or interpreting this Agreement.



(e) Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received (i) when delivered by hand; (ii)
on the day sent by facsimile, provided that the sender has received
confirmation of transmission as of or prior to 5:00 p.m. local time of the

(i) __Jurisdiction _._ Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement may be brought in the superior courts of the State of California

5 EXHIBIT C

 



LOCK-UP AGREEMENT



This Lock-Up Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
November __, 2005, between Marines Corporation , a Delaware corporation (
_"Parent"_ ), and the undersigned stockholder and/or optionholder ( _"Holder"_
) of Army, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  _"Company"_ ). Terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).



RECITALS



WHEREAS, the Holder is the registered owner of (1) such number of issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the  _"Shares"_ ) and (2) options
to purchase such number of shares of Company Common Stock (the _"Options"_ ),
each as is indicated beneath Holders signature on the last page of this
Agreement; and



WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
November ___, 2005, as may be amended from time to time (including such
amendments, herein called the _"Merger Agreement"_ ) by and among Parent, Army
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, and the Company, it is proposed that Parent shall pay cash and issue
shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for the Shares and assume the
Options; and



WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent consummating the Merger,
Parent has required that Holder enter into this Agreement to serve the
general purpose of better aligning Holders financial interests with the
success of the transaction contemplated in the Merger Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable considerations, receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 



AGREEMENT



1\. Agreement to Retain Shares.



(a) Transfer and Encumbrance. Except as contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
and except as provided in Sections 1(b) and 2 below, during the period
beginning on the date hereof and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) ninety
(90) days following the Effective Date, and (ii) the Expiration Date (as
defined below), Holder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, (A) transfer
(except as may be specifically required by court order), sell, exchange,
tender, assign, contribute to the capital of any entity, or otherwise dispose
of (including by merger, consolidation or otherwise by operation of law) or
encumber the Shares or any New Shares (as defined below), including any shares
of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for such Shares pursuant to the
Merger, enter into any short sale with respect to the Shares or any New
Shares, enter into or acquire an offsetting derivative contract with respect
to such Shares or any New Shares, enter into or acquire a futures or forward
contract to deliver such Shares or any New Shares or enter into any other
hedging or other derivative transaction that has the effect of materially
changing the economic benefits and risks of ownership of the Shares or any New
Shares, or to, directly  



 

1  or indirectly, make any offer or agreement relating thereto, (B) grant any
proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any of such Shares or New Shares
into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of
such Shares or New Shares, or enter into any agreement or arrangement
providing for any of the actions described in this clause, or (C) take any
action that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or
disabling Holder from performing Holders obligations under this Agreement,
and Holder warrants that it has not agreed to carry out any of the foregoing
matters in relation to the Shares or any New Shares; _provided_ , _however_
that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1(a), the Holder may
provide an irrevocable undertaking or other form of support agreement to
Parent or Company in relation to the Merger. As used herein, the term
"Expiration Date" shall mean the date of termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms and provisions thereof. During the period from
ninety (90) to one hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Date,
the foregoing restriction applies to fifty percent (50%) of the Shares and
fifty percent (50%) of any News Shares, and after one hundred eighty (180)
days, the foregoing restriction does not apply.



(b) Permitted Transfers. Section 1(a) shall not prohibit a transfer of Shares
or New Shares by Holder (i) if Holder is an individual (A) to any member of
Holders immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of Holder or any
member of Holders immediate family, or (B) upon the death of Holder, or (ii)
if Holder is a partnership or limited liability company, to one or more
partners or members of Holder or to an affiliated Person under common control
or common management with Holder; provided, however, that any such transfer
pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 1(b) shall be permitted
only if, as a precondition to such transfer, the transferee agrees in writing
to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, or (iii) with respect to
Options under the Company Stock Option Plans, Holder may sell New Shares upon
or after exercise thereof pursuant to an effective Registration Statement to
be filed by Parent under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act")
provided also that such New Shares are sold in accordance with Parents
Insider Trading Policy and Rule 145 of the rules and regulations prescribed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to the Securities Act
("Rule 145").



(c) New Shares. Holder agrees that New Shares (as defined below) shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if
they constituted Shares. The term "New Shares" shall mean any and all
shares of capital stock or interests in shares or other securities of the
Company or Parent, including any shares of Parent Common Stock received in
exchange for such Shares pursuant to the Merger and/or received upon exercise
of the Options assumed by Parent pursuant to the Merger, that Holder
purchases or with respect to which Holder otherwise acquires registered or
beneficial ownership after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier
to occur of (i) one hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Date
and (ii) the Expiration Date.



2\. Restrictions on Shares and New Shares



(a) General. Holder has been advised that, as of the date hereof, Holder may
be deemed to be an _"affiliate"_ of the Company, as the term _"affiliate"_ is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145. Holder will
receive Parent Common Stock in exchange for the Shares or New Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2, the
execution of this Agreement should not be considered an admission on Holders
part that Holder is an _"affiliate"_ of the Company, nor as a waiver of any
rights Holder may have to object to any claim that Holder is such an affiliate
on or after the date of this Agreement.



 

2 (b) Holder Representations; Restrictions on Transfer; Legends Holder
represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that in the event Holder
receives any Parent Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger:



(i) Holder shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
Parent Common Stock in violation of the Securities Act. 



(ii) Holder has carefully read this Agreement and discussed the requirements
of this Agreement and other applicable limitations upon Holders ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock received in
exchange for the Shares, to the extent Holder has felt necessary, with
Holders counsel.



(iii) Holder has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger will be registered on a registration statement on
Form S-4 promulgated under the Securities Act (the _"Registration Statement"_
) and the resale of such Parent Common Stock may be subject to restrictions
set forth in Rule 145. Holder has been advised that, because Holder may be
deemed to be an _"affiliate"_ of the Company, Holder may not sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the Parent Common Stock issued to Holder in the Merger,
unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with
the limitations of Rule 145, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition has
been registered under the Securities Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is
otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.



(iv) Holder understands and agrees that stop transfer instructions will be
given to Parents transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock
issued to directors, executive officers and ten percent (10%) holders of any
class of securities of the Company (as of immediately prior to the Merger)
and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Parent Common Stock
issued to directors, executive officers and 10% holders of any class of
securities of the Company (as of immediately prior to the Merger), or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: _"THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145
PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES. THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
RULE 145."_ If a sale or transfer is made prior to such legend being removed
pursuant to Section 2(c) below, certificates with the above legend will be
substituted by delivery of certificates without such legend upon delivery of
a declaration to Parent (the _"Declaration"_ ), which Declaration shall be
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent, that the requirements
of Rule 145(d)(1) have been complied with. 



(v) Holder understands and agrees that stop transfer instructions will be
given to Parents transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock
issued to Holder and there will be placed on the certificates for the Parent
Common Stock issued to Holder, or any substitutions therefore, a legend, in
addition to all other legends necessary under applicable law, stating in
substance: " _THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
TRANSFERRED UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT DATED
NOVEMBER  _ _, 2005 ENTERED INTO BY AND AMONG MARINES_  



 

3   _CORPORATION, ARMY ACQUISITION CORP. AND ARMY, INC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS OF A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT DATED  _ _ _ _, 2005
BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND MARINES CORPORATION, A COPY OF
WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF MARINES CORPORATION."_



(c). Parent Representations.



(i) Parent hereby agrees that, unless previously sold pursuant to the
applicable requirements of Rule 145, it is understood and agreed that
certificates with the legend set forth in Section 2(b)(iv) above will be
substituted by delivery of certificates without such legend, and any stop
transfer instructions then in effect will be terminated, if (i) one (1) year
shall have elapsed from the date Holder acquired the Parent Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available
to Holder, (ii) two (2) years shall have elapsed from the date Holder acquired
the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(3) are then available to Holder, or (iii) Parent has received either an
opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, or a  _"no action"_ letter obtained by Holder from the staff of
the SEC, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act no longer apply to Holder. For as long as resale of any shares
of Parent Common Stock owned by Holder are subject to Rule 145, Parent will
use its reasonable efforts to make all filings of the nature specified in
paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Upon receipt of a
properly completed Declaration, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to
instruct its transfer agent to deliver shares of Parent Common Stock without
the legend set forth in Section 2(b)(iv) above in accordance with the terms of
the transfer set forth in the Declaration as soon as practicable following
receipt of such Declaration.



(ii) Parent hereby agrees that it is understood and agreed that certificates
with the legend set forth in Section 2(b)(v) above will, to the extent
required to enable the shares represented by such certificate to be
transferred by the holder thereof, be substituted by delivery of certificates
without such legend upon the written request of the Holder if, and to the
extent the restriction in Section 1(a) shall have lapsed. Upon receipt of any
such written request, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to instruct its
transfer agent to deliver shares of Parent Common Stock without the legend set
forth in Section 2(b)(v) above as soon as practicable following receipt of
such written request.



4\. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Holder.



Holder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that Holder (i) is
the registered owner and, as set forth on the signature page, beneficial
owner, of the Shares and Options to purchase Company Common Stock, if any,
indicated below Holders signature on the signature page to this Agreement,
and (ii) is not the registered owner of any shares, options or other
securities in, or convertible into, share capital of the Company, other than
the Shares and the Options to purchase Company Common Stock, if any, indicated
below Holders signature on the last page of this Agreement. Holder has the
legal capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform all of Holders
obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Holder and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Holder, enforceable against Holder in accordance with its terms,
subject to (a) laws of general  



 

4  application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and
(b) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies.



5\. Further Assurances



Holder shall perform such further acts and execute such further documents
and instruments as may reasonably be required to vest in Parent the power to
carry out and give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.



6\. Fiduciary Duties



Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) Holder makes
no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in Holders
capacity as a registered owner of the Shares and, to the extent applicable,
any New Shares, (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or
affect any action or inaction by Holder, or any officer, partner, member
or employee, as applicable, of Holder, serving on the Companys Board of
Directors acting in such persons capacity as a director or fiduciary of the
Company, and (iii) Holder shall have no liability to Parent or any its
affiliates under this Agreement as a result of any action or inaction by
Holder, or any officer, partner, member or employee, as applicable, of Holder,
serving on the Companys Board of Directors acting in such persons capacity
as a director or fiduciary of the Company.



7\. Miscellaneous



(a) Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or
waived with the written consent of the parties or their respective successors
and assigns. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section
7(a) shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed,
construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.



(c) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one instrument.



(d) Titles and Subtitles. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are
used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement.



(e) Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received (i) when delivered by
hand; (ii) on the day sent by facsimile, provided that the sender has

written notice given to the other party hereto).



(f) Severability. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
invalid or unenforceable under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, the
parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith, in order to
maintain the economic position enjoyed by each party as close as possible
to that under the provision rendered unenforceable. In the event that the
parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such
provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii)
the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were
so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable in accordance with its terms. Each provision of this Agreement is
separable from any other provisions of this Agreement, and each part of each
provision of this Agreement is severable from every other part of such
provision.



(g) Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto recognizes and
acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this

adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore each of the parties
hereto agrees that in the event of any such breach Parent shall be entitled to
the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and
injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which

Agreement.



(i) Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto, except as provided in (j).

agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral among the parties with

OPTION ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT



Dear «FirstName» «LastName»:



On  _ _, 2005 (the "Effective Date") Marines Corporation
(the "Parent") acquired Army, Inc. (the "Company") (the "Acquisition") and on
the Effective Date you held one or more outstanding options to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock granted to you under the Companys 1995 Stock Option
Plan or the Companys Army, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively,
the _"Company Stock Option Plans"_ ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the
Effective Date, Parent assumed all obligations of Company under your
outstanding option (or options as listed below). This Option Assumption
Agreement (the "Agreement") evidences the terms of Parents assumption of an
option (or options) to purchase Company Common Stock granted to you under the
Company Stock Option Plans (the "Company Option"), and documented by a stock
option agreement (or stock option agreements) and any amendment(s) entered
into by and between you and Company (the "Option Agreement(s)"), including the
necessary adjustments for assumption of the Company Option(s) that are
required by the Acquisition.



Terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in
the Merger Agreement.



The table below summarizes your Company Option(s) immediately before the
Acquisition and your Assumed Company Options after the Acquisition:



     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  COMPANY OPTION 

* * *

 |  | ASSUMED COMPANY 
OPTION 

* * * 

   |  |  |  |  | 
  Grant Date |  | Option Plan- 
Type |  | Company Shares |  | Exercise Price 
per Share |  | No. of Shares of 
Parent Stock |  | Exercise Price

  «GrantDate» |  | «OptionType»- 
«OptionType» |  | «Company Shares» |  | $«Company Price» |  | «Parent
Shares» |  | $«Parent Price» 
 



The post-Acquisition adjustments are based on the Implied Exchange Ratio of
0. _ _ (as determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, which is based on the Exchange Ratio and increased by an amount
that accounts for the value of the Cash Component in terms of Parent Common
Stock) and are intended to: (i) assure that the total spread of your assumed
Company Option(s) ( _i.e._ , the difference between the aggregate fair market
value and the aggregate exercise price) does not exceed the total spread that
existed immediately prior to the Acquisition; (ii) to preserve, on a per share
basis, the ratio of exercise price to fair market value that existed
immediately prior to the Acquisition and (iii) to the extent applicable and
allowable by law, to retain incentive stock option ("ISO") status under
federal tax laws. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to your
assumed Company Option(s) was determined by multiplying the Implied Exchange
Ratio by the number of shares remaining subject to your Company Option(s) on
the Closing Date and rounding the resulting product down to the next whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The exercise price per share of  



 

1  your assumed Company Option(s) was determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of your Company Option(s) by the Implied Exchange Ratio and
rounding the resulting quotient up to the next whole cent.



All references in the Option Agreement(s) and the Company Stock Option Plans
relating to your status as an employee of Company will now be deemed to refer
to your status as an employee of Parent or any present or future Parent
subsidiary.



The expiration date of your assumed Company Option(s) remain the same as
set forth in the Option Agreement(s), but the number of shares subject to
each vesting installment and the exercise price per share have been adjusted
to reflect the effect of the Acquisition. All other provisions which govern
either the exercise or the termination of your assumed Company Option(s)
remain the same as set forth in the Option Agreement(s), and the provisions of
the Option Agreement(s) (except as expressly modified by this Agreement and
the Acquisition) will govern and control your rights under this Agreement to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon termination of your employment
with Parent you will have the limited post-termination exercise period
specified in your Option Agreement(s) for your assumed Company Option(s) to
the extent vested and outstanding at the time of termination after which time
your assumed Company Option(s) will expire and NOT be exercisable for Parent
Common Stock.



Nothing in this Agreement or the Option Agreement(s) interferes in any way
with your right and Parents right, which rights are expressly reserved, to
terminate your employment at any time for any reason. Future options, if any,
you may receive from Parent will be governed by the terms of the Parent stock
option plan under which such options are granted, and such terms may be
different from the terms of your assumed Company Option(s), including, but not
limited to, the time period in which you have to exercise vested options after
your termination of employment.
