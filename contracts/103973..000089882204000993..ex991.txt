pertaining to such Transferred Business Employees), other than those liabilities
and obligations assumed under SECTION 1.3(d);

     (i) all liabilities and obligations for any Taxes (other than Transfer
Taxes that are Purchaser's responsibility pursuant to SECTION 10.5) of either
Seller (or any of its Affiliates) relating to Taxes, the Purchased Assets or the
Business for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, including real and personal property taxes which shall be prorated
on a daily basis to the Closing Date, in each case to the extent not reflected
on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. To the extent Purchaser (or any of its
Affiliates) is billed for any Taxes which are Excluded Liabilities, Purchaser
shall notify Vulcan in writing thereof prior to paying any such Taxes, and
Vulcan shall be entitled to pursue and control any Tax Contest relating to any
Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities. If within ten (10) calendar days after
Vulcan receives such written notice from Purchaser, Vulcan shall not have
objected to Purchaser's written notice, Vulcan shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to such Taxes. In the event that Vulcan objects to Purchaser's written
notice within such ten (10) day period, Purchaser and Vulcan shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If Vulcan and Purchaser are unable to reach
an agreement within thirty (30) days after Vulcan's receipt of Purchaser's
written notice, the dispute shall be resolved by an independent, nationally
recognized firm of accountants mutually selected by the parties (the
"ACCOUNTANT"). Each of Purchaser and Vulcan shall bear all fees and costs
incurred by it in connection with the resolution of such dispute, except that
the parties shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the
Accountant.

     Section 1.5 NONASSIGNABLE BUSINESS CONTRACTS. In the case of any Business
Contracts that are not by their terms assignable or transferable, Sellers shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, on or prior to
the Closing, any approvals or consents necessary to convey to Purchaser the
benefit thereof. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in such manner as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. In the event any consent or
approval to an assignment contemplated hereby is not obtained on or prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain
any such approval or consent after the Closing Date until such time as such
consent or approval has been obtained or it shall become reasonably apparent
that such consent or approval is not forthcoming, and Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with Purchaser, to provide Purchaser
with an appropriate and economically feasible arrangement (a "WORK-AROUND") to
provide that Purchaser shall receive the applicable Seller's interest in and to
the benefits under any such Business Contract; PROVIDED, that Purchaser shall
undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of
such benefit to the extent (a) Purchaser is receiving such interest and benefits
and (b) Purchaser would have been responsible therefor if such consent or
approval had been obtained, in which case such Business Contract will be treated
as a Business Contract for all purposes hereunder to the extent of such
Work-around. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Business
Contract shall be deemed a Purchased Asset hereunder unless and

                                      -7-

<PAGE>


until any required consent or approval has been obtained, except to the extent
that a Work-around has been implemented.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                  CONSIDERATION

     Section 2.1. AMOUNT AND FORM OF CONSIDERATION. The consideration to be paid
by Purchaser to Sellers in consideration of the Purchased Assets shall consist
of:

     (a) One Hundred Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($185,000,000) plus the Closing
Date Debt Payment Amount (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"), to be paid to Sellers by
Purchaser by wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with written wire
instructions delivered to Purchaser by Vulcan at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, subject to adjustment as set forth in SECTIONS 2.2
and 10.3; and

     (b) the assumption on the Closing Date as of the Effective Time of the
Assumed Liabilities.

     Section 2.2. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

     (a) Within ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Vulcan an unaudited
balance sheet of the Business as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(as may be adjusted following resolution of disputes in accordance with this
SECTION 2.2, the "CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet
will be prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting principles,
procedures, policies and methods that were employed in preparing the Interim
Balance Sheet. Based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and this SECTION 2.2,
Purchaser shall prepare a certificate setting forth a calculation of the Working
Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"),
and the Indebtedness of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING
INDEBTEDNESS" and, together with Closing Working Capital, the "CLOSING
AMOUNTS"), which calculations shall each be prepared in the same manner as the
calculation of the Working Capital and of the Indebtedness of the Business as of
December 31, 2003 were prepared as set forth on SCHEDULE 2.2(e).

     (b) During the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Closing Amounts, and the period of any dispute within the
contemplation of this SECTION 2.2, (i) Vulcan shall: (x) provide Purchaser and
Purchaser's representatives with reasonable access to the former employees of
the Business who are not Transferred Business Employees; and (y) cooperate fully
with Purchaser and Purchaser's representatives, including by providing on a
timely basis all information reasonably necessary or useful in the preparation
of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Amounts not
in the possession of Purchaser or its representatives; and (ii) Purchaser shall
cooperate fully with Vulcan and Vulcan's representatives, including by providing
on a timely basis all information reasonably necessary or useful in Vulcan's
review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing
Amounts.

                                      -8-

<PAGE>


     (c) After receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Closing Amounts, Vulcan shall have thirty (30) calendar days to review the
calculation of the Closing Amounts. Vulcan and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to all relevant books, records and employees of Purchaser to
the extent reasonably required to complete their review of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Amounts. Vulcan may dispute
items reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Amounts only on the basis that such amounts (i) were not determined in
conformity with GAAP using the same accounting principles, procedures, policies
and methods that were employed in preparing the Interim Balance Sheet, (ii)
contain arithmetic error or (iii) include assets or liabilities not constituting
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. Except to the extent Vulcan delivers
written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day
after Vulcan's receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Closing Amounts, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the amount,
nature and basis of all disputed items, Vulcan shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to the calculation of the Closing Amounts. If Vulcan so notifies
Purchaser of its objection to the calculation of one or more Closing Amounts,
Purchaser and Vulcan shall, within thirty (30) calendar days following such
notice (the "RESOLUTION PERIOD"), attempt to resolve their differences and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be set forth in writing and
shall be final, binding and conclusive.

     (d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are still amounts
remaining in dispute, then all such amounts shall be submitted to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, or such other nationally recognized accounting firm that
is not then the independent auditor for either party and is selected by mutual
agreement of Vulcan and Purchaser (the "NEUTRAL AUDITORS"), within ten (10)
calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution Period. Each party agrees
to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable engagement
letter, including customary indemnities. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne pro rata as
between Vulcan, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion
to the allocation of the dollar amount of the amounts remaining in dispute
between Vulcan and Purchaser made by the Neutral Auditors such that the
prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses. The
Neutral Auditors shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
provisions of this SECTION 2.2 and the presentations by Vulcan and Purchaser,
and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and only as to
whether such amounts (i) were arrived at in conformity with GAAP using the same
accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods that were employed in
preparing the Interim Balance Sheet, (ii) contain arithmetic error or (iii)
include assets or liabilities not constituting Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities. The Neutral Auditors' determination shall be made within thirty
(30) calendar days of their selection, shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Vulcan and Purchaser and shall be final, binding and conclusive.
The terms "FINAL CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL" and "FINAL INDEBTEDNESS" shall mean
the definitive Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness, in each case,
as agreed to (or deemed to be agreed to) by Purchaser and Vulcan in accordance
with the terms of SECTION 2.2(c) or resulting from the determinations made by
the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this SECTION 2.2(d) (in addition to
those items theretofore agreed to by Vulcan and Purchaser).

     (e) The Cash Consideration shall be (i) increased dollar for dollar to the
extent that Final Closing Working Capital exceeds Seventy-Five Million Dollars
($75,000,000), (ii) increased dollar for dollar to the extent that the Closing
Date Debt Payment Amount is less than

                                      -9-

<PAGE>


Twenty-Nine Million Dollars ($29,000,000) less the Final Indebtedness, (iii)
decreased dollar for dollar to the extent that Final Closing Working Capital
is less than Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) and (iv) decreased
dollar for dollar to the extent that Closing Date Debt Payment Amount exceeds
Twenty-Nine Million Dollars ($29,000,000) less the Final Indebtedness.  Any
adjustments to the Cash Consideration made pursuant to this SECTION 2.2(e)
shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the date of payment at the
fluctuating interest rate that is equal to the rate of interest from time to
time announced in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL under the heading caption "Money
Rates" as the "prime rate." Any adjustments to the Cash Consideration made
pursuant to this SECTION 2.2(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by Vulcan, if Vulcan is owed payment,
or to the account specified by Purchaser, if Purchaser is owed payment, within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital and Final
Indebtedness is agreed to by Purchaser and Vulcan or any remaining disputed
items are ultimately determined by the Neutral Auditors.

     Section 2.3. ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Vulcan and Purchaser agree to
cooperate in good faith to determine a reasonable allocation of the Cash
Consideration and the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "PURCHASE PRICE"),
as finally determined pursuant to SECTIONS 2.1 and 2.2, in accordance with
section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. On or prior to
the date ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide to Vulcan Purchaser's proposed allocation of the Purchase Price as
finally determined by Purchaser hereunder. Within thirty (30) calendar days
after the receipt of such allocation, Vulcan shall propose to Purchaser any
changes to such allocation or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with such
allocation. Vulcan and Purchaser shall cooperate (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate) in good faith to mutually agree to such
allocation and shall reduce such agreement to writing, including jointly and
properly executing a completed Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and any other
forms or statements required by the Code, Treasury Regulations or the Internal
Revenue Service, together with any and all attachments required to be filed
therewith. Vulcan and Purchaser shall file timely any such forms and statements
with the Internal Revenue Service. In the event that Vulcan proposes changes to
the allocation within the thirty (30) calendar day period described above and
the parties have not agreed to the allocation of the Purchase Price within sixty
(60) calendar days after Vulcan's receipt of Purchaser's proposed allocation,
any disputed items shall be resolved by the Neutral Auditors. The determination
of the Neutral Auditors shall be final and binding upon both parties, and
Purchaser and Vulcan shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the costs, fees and
expenses of the Neutral Auditors relating to the allocation. The allocation of
the Purchase Price shall be revised to take into account subsequent adjustments
to the Purchase Price, including any adjustments pursuant to SECTION 2.2 and any
additional consideration owed pursuant to SECTION 2.4, in the manner provided by
section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Vulcan and
Purchaser shall not file (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to
file) any tax return or other documents or otherwise take any position with
respect to taxes which is inconsistent with such allocation of the final
Purchase Price; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Vulcan nor Purchaser (nor their
respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to litigate any challenge to such
allocation of the final Purchase Price by any Governmental Body. Vulcan and
Purchaser shall promptly inform one another of any challenge by any Governmental
Body to any allocation made pursuant to this SECTION 2.3 and agree to consult
with and keep one another informed with respect to the state of, and any
discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such challenge.

     Section 2.4. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. As additional consideration for the
purchase of the Purchased Assets, Purchaser shall make the following contingent
payments (singly or collectively, the "CONTINGENT PAYMENTS") to Vulcan to the
extent such Contingent Payments are owed to Vulcan pursuant to SCHEDULE 2.4(a)
or 2.4(b):

     (a) For each of the first five (5) successive twelve (12) month periods
commencing on the first day of the month following the Closing Date (an "ECU
YEAR"), Purchaser shall pay Vulcan an amount equal to any ECU annual contingent
payment (the "ECU CONTINGENT PAYMENT") that would be due to Vulcan pursuant to
SCHEDULE 2.4(a) for that ECU Year; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the maximum aggregate
amount of ECU Contingent Payments for all ECU Years shall not exceed One Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000). Any ECU Contingent Payment owed to Vulcan
for a given ECU Year shall be paid by Purchaser within ninety (90) calendar days
after the end of that ECU Year.

     (b) Subject always to the adjustment and recapture provisions of Section 5
(Enterprise Incentives) in the underlying contract with Honeywell, for each
calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2005 (a "5CP YEAR"), Purchaser
shall pay Vulcan an amount equal to any 5CP annual contingent payment (the "5CP
CONTINGENT PAYMENT") that would be due to Vulcan pursuant to SCHEDULE 2.4(b) for
that 5CP Year; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (a) if the Closing Date occurs after
January 1, 2005, the first 5CP Year shall be for the period from the Closing
Date until December 31, 2005 and (b) no 5CP Contingent Payment shall accrue for
any year commencing on or after January 1, 2013. Any 5CP Contingent Payment owed
to Vulcan for a given 5CP Year shall be paid by March 31 of the following year.

     (c) Concurrently with Purchaser's payment of any Contingent
Payments,Purchaser shall send or cause to be sent to Vulcan a statement,
certified by the chief financial officer of Purchaser, setting forth in
reasonable detail Purchaser's calculation of the applicable Contingent Payments.
If no ECU Contingent Payment is owed for any ECU Year that commences on or
before the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, within ninety (90)
calendar days after the end of that ECU Year, Purchaser shall send or cause to
be sent to Vulcan a statement, certified by the chief financial officer of
Purchaser, setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's calculation of the
lack of any ECU Contingent Payment owed to Vulcan for that ECU Year. If no 5CP
Contingent Payment is owed for any 5CP Year that commences before January 1,
2013, within ninety (90) calendar days after the end of that 5CP Year, Purchaser
shall send or cause to be sent to Vulcan a statement, certified by the chief
financial officer of Purchaser, setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's
calculation of the lack of any 5CP Contingent Payment owed to Vulcan for that
5CP Year. (Each of the aforementioned certified statements mentioned in this
SECTION 2.4(c) is referred to as an "EARNOUT STATEMENT.")

     (d) Within thirty (30) calendar days after Vulcan's receipt of an Earnout
Statement, Vulcan shall have the right to request and receive from Purchaser
access (on a confidential basis) to the books, records, facilities and employees
of Purchaser or Parent reasonably necessary to verify the amount of the
Contingent Payments (or the absence thereof) and the accuracy of that Earnout
Statement.

     (e) If Vulcan disagrees with the calculation of the Earnout Statement,
then Vulcan shall notify Purchaser in writing of such disagreement within thirty
(30) calendar days

                                      -11-

<PAGE>


after Vulcan's receipt of all information requested pursuant to SECTION 2.4(d).
Except to the extent Vulcan delivers written notice to Purchaser within the
period specified in the preceding sentence, which notice specifies in reasonable
detail the amount, nature and basis of all disputed items, Vulcan shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the calculation of the applicable Earnout
Statement. If Vulcan so notifies Purchaser of its objection to the calculation
of the Earnout Statement, Purchaser and Vulcan shall, within thirty (30)
calendar days following such notice, attempt to resolve their differences and
any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be set forth in writing
and shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Purchaser and Vulcan are unable
to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery to Vulcan of written notice of such disagreement by Purchaser, then
Purchaser and Vulcan jointly shall select an arbitrator from one of the
internationally recognized, large accounting firms that is not the independent
auditor for either Purchaser or Vulcan and that has not had any material
engagement with either Purchaser or Vulcan during the preceding three (3) years
(which shall be the Neutral Auditors unless the parties otherwise agree or the
Neutral Auditors no longer meet the foregoing requirements) (the "ACCOUNTING
ARBITRATOR"). Upon the execution by the Accounting Arbitrator of a
confidentiality agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser,
Vulcan and Purchaser shall submit in writing their respective positions to the
Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall only consider those items
and amounts as to which Purchaser and Vulcan have disagreed within the time
periods and on the terms specified above and shall resolve the matter in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof. The Accounting Arbitrator shall
select as a resolution the position of either Purchaser or Vulcan for each item
of disagreement (based solely on presentations and supporting materials provided
by Vulcan and Purchaser and not pursuant to any independent review) and may not
impose an alternative resolution. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to
Purchaser and Vulcan, as promptly as practicable and in any event within
forty-five (45) calendar days after its appointment, a written report setting
forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the
terms hereof. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The fees, expenses and costs of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata as between Vulcan, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the
dollar amount of the amounts remaining in dispute between Vulcan and Purchaser
made by the Accounting Auditors such that the prevailing party pays the lesser
proportion of the fees and expenses. Within five (5) Business Days following the
Accounting Arbitrator's final determination pursuant to this SECTION 2.4, the
party owing the other party any money as a result of such determination, shall
pay such money to the other party.

     Section 2.5. CONDEMNATION OF, OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO, GEISMAR ASSETS. (a)
If, prior to the Closing, the Geismar, Louisiana plant is condemned or there is
any destruction of, or damage to, all or any part of the Geismar, Louisiana
plant, which condemnation, destruction or damage could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on production (or the costs of production) from
such plant following the Closing (a "CASUALTY EVENT"), then Purchaser may
determine to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of such
termination to Vulcan within ten (10) business days of notice from Vulcan to
Purchaser as provided in SECTION 2.5(b) unless Vulcan shall have given Purchaser
written notice prior to, or within ten (10) business days following, such
termination notice of its election to repair, rebuild, restore or replace such
assets as provided below.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>


     (b) Vulcan shall give Purchaser prompt written notice of any Casualty Event
(such notice, a "CASUALTY NOTICE") indicating the asset or assets which suffered
a Casualty Event, and the net book value of each such asset, accompanied by
copies of all insurance related thereto, any deductibles or retention applicable
thereto, any defenses threatened or asserted by the insurer and known to Vulcan,
all information relevant to the cost of repair, reconstruction, restoration or
replacement, and any other information reasonably requested by Purchaser.

     (c) Subject to SECTION 2.5(a), in the event of a Casualty Event, Vulcan
may, by notice to Purchaser, elect to repair, rebuild, restore or replace the
affected assets, and, upon any such election, Vulcan shall promptly undertake to
repair, rebuild, restore or replace such assets to a condition substantially
comparable to that existing prior to the event causing such destruction or
damage; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Vulcan shall only be permitted to give Purchaser
notice pursuant to this SECTION 2.5(c) if an independent engineer reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser notifies Purchaser and Vulcan that such engineer
reasonably believes that the repair, rebuilding, restoration or replacement of
such asset, as applicable, can be completed before the later of (i) the
Termination Date and (ii) one-hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date
of such election.

liability company, respectively, under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
the conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties requires such
qualification, authorization or license, except where the failure to be so

requisite corporate or company power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby to be executed by Vulcan or the JV in connection with the

agreements, documents, instruments and certificates required to be executed by
Vulcan and/or the JV being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "SELLER

arisen only from bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business.
Neither Vulcan nor the JV has Knowledge as of the date hereof of any facts or
circumstances generally that would result in any material increase in the
uncollectability of such receivables as a class in excess of the reserves
therefor set forth on the Full Year Financial Statements or the Interim
Financial Statements.

     Section 4.21. INVENTORY. All Inventory is of a quality consistent with past
practice in all material respects and does not include obsolete or discontinued
items. The quantity of each item of Inventory (whether raw materials, work in
process or finished goods) is not excessive but is reasonable in the present
circumstances of Vulcan and the JV. No write-down in the Inventory has been made
or should have been made pursuant to GAAP during the past two (2) years prior to
the date hereof.

     Section 4.22. PUHCA; STATE UTILITY LAW. Neither Vulcan nor the JV is
subject to regulation (a) as a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act; (b)
as a "public-utility company," a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" or
"affiliate" of a "public-utility company" or a "holding company," within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("PUHCA"); or (c) under any state
law or regulation with respect to the rates of electric utilities or the
financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities.

     Section 4.23. BOOKS AND RECORDS. The books of account and other financial
records of Vulcan or the JV that have been made available to Purchaser are
complete and correct in all material respects and represent actual bona fide
transactions and have been maintained in all material respects in accordance
with customary business practices, including the maintenance of an adequate
system of internal controls.

and certificates required to be executed by Purchaser being hereinafter referred
to, collectively, as the "PURCHASER DOCUMENTS"), and to perform fully its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by

authorization, execution and delivery by Sellers) this Agreement constitutes,
and each of the Purchaser Documents when so executed and delivered will
constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability
hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and equitable
principles of general applicability.

     Section 5.3. CONFLICTS; CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES. None of the execution
and delivery by Purchaser of the Purchaser Documents, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or compliance by Purchaser with any
of the provisions hereof or thereof will (a) result in the breach of any
provision of its certificate of formation or other organization documents; or
(b) constitute a violation of any Law applicable to Purchaser except, in the
case of (b), as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Purchaser. No consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or
authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person
or Governmental Body is required on the part of Purchaser in connection with the
execution and delivery hereof or the Purchaser Documents, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the compliance by Purchaser
with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, except (i) for such consents,
waivers, approvals, Orders, Permits or authorizations of, or declarations or
filings with, or notifications to, any Person or Governmental Body as to which
the failure to receive or make any of the same, individually or in the

Purchaser and (ii) for compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR
Act or of competition or similar laws of other applicable jurisdictions.

     Section 5.4. LITIGATION. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser as of the date hereof,

in respect of, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened
Legal Proceedings in which Purchaser is (or if such Legal Proceeding is
threatened, may become) a party and that would materially impair the ability of
Purchaser to comply with its obligations hereunder.

                                      -26-


     Section 5.5. FINANCING. On the date hereof, Purchaser has sufficient cash

negotiations relating to or the transactions contemplated hereby and no Person
is entitled to any fee or commission or like payment in respect thereof from
Sellers based in any way on agreements, arrangements or understandings made by
or on behalf of Purchaser.

                                   ARTICLE VI

the Purchased Properties, in all cases to the extent permitted by applicable
law; PROVIDED, that in each case, such access shall be given at reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice and without undue interruption to Sellers' business

a claim of force majeure or of excusable delay or nonperformance by either
Seller or any other party to any Business Contract; and (ii) correspondence and
notices received by either Seller after the date hereof relating to material
environmental, health or safety conditions or material compliance matters

matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with each other in obtaining any

hereby. Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request
in connection with the foregoing and shall each promptly provide counsel for the
other party with copies of all filings made by such party, and all
correspondence between such party (and its advisors) and any Governmental Body
and any other information supplied by such party and such party's Affiliates to
a Governmental Body in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated
hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser and Seller may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other as "outside counsel only," and materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business and
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements. Materials designated
as for "outside counsel only" and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Each party shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for the
other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Body. Purchaser and Seller agree not to
participate, or to permit their affiliates to participate, in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Body in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Body, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Seller shall not be deemed to have breached
this covenant if (A) Seller uses efforts reasonable under the circumstances to
contact Purchaser or its representatives, but is nonetheless unable to reach
Purchaser or its representatives prior to the time at which such Governmental
Body proposes to conduct such meeting or discussion or (B) any such designated
representatives are unable to participate in such meeting at such proposed time.

     Section 6.4  PUBLIC STATEMENTS. Before Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Sellers shall
so advise and cooperate with Purchaser and shall not release or permit to be
released such information without Purchaser's consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such information
is otherwise publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by
Sellers made in breach of this SECTION 6.4 or (b) the release thereof is, in the
reasonable judgment of Vulcan, required by any Law (including any rule of any
securities exchange on which Vulcan's securities are traded) or Order to which
either Seller or its Affiliate is bound or subject; PROVIDED, in the case of
this clause (b), that Sellers take all reasonable endeavors to notify Purchaser
prior to making any such disclosure and shall restrict such disclosure to the
minimum required by Law (in the reasonable judgment of Vulcan).

     Section 6.5 FURTHER ACTIONS. Sellers shall use all reasonable efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied as promptly as practicable its obligations
hereunder and the conditions precedent to Closing in ARTICLE VIII. After the
Closing, Sellers will duly execute and deliver such assignments, bills of sale,
deeds, acknowledgments and other instruments of conveyance and transfer as shall
at any time be reasonably necessary or appropriate to convey to Purchaser the
Purchased Assets or to result in the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities. From the execution hereof until the Closing, each Seller agrees to
promptly notify Purchaser of any known material breach of any representation or
warranty of Sellers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in ARTICLE VIII to be satisfied, to give rise to any
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE XIII or any
indemnification rights under ARTICLE XI, in each case unless the underlying
failure of a representation or warranty to be true would independently result in
a failure of such condition to be satisfied or give rise to such termination or
indemnification right.

     Section 6.6 NO SOLICITATION. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, agent, investment banker
or representative of any of them or otherwise, encourage, solicit, participate
in or initiate discussions or agreements

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

with respect to the sale of the Business to any person other than Purchaser and
its Affiliates, officers, directors, agents, investment bankers and
representatives. Vulcan will notify Purchaser promptly following any inquiry or
proposal received with respect to any such transaction. As of the date hereof,
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
agents, investment bankers and representatives to, cease any pending discussions
or negotiations regarding any such transaction.

     Section 6.7  LITIGATION. Consistent with the allocation of SECTION 1.4,
Sellers will remain responsible for the costs, expenses, and liabilities,
including defense, for all Excluded Liabilities, including the Legal Proceedings
described in the Disclosure Schedule pertaining to its representations and
warranties in SECTION 4.14 and any other Legal Proceedings filed against either
Seller or its Affiliates before the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Purchaser shall cooperate in the defense of such Legal Proceedings as may be
reasonably required through access to personnel, books and records.

     Section 6.8  DRY CLEANING BUSINESS. Vulcan will manage its exit from
the CareFill Dry Cleaning Business in such a way as to minimize any common law
liability for termination of the distributors, and will confirm its termination
notice to RR Street regarding the termination of the RR Street Agreement and
implement an exit from such business prior to or promptly following the Closing.
Sellers will terminate any other contracts, agreements or arrangements relating
to dry-cleaning applications of perchloroethylene and implement an exit from
such business prior to or promptly following the Closing. Purchaser shall not be
obligated to manufacture, sell or distribute perchloroethylene for use in
dry-cleaning applications associated with the foregoing terminations or
otherwise. Purchaser shall reimburse Vulcan for (and only for) direct cash
termination fees that are specified for termination in the applicable contracts
existing as of the date hereof with such distributors and RR Street & Company,
Inc. promptly upon presentation of invoices to Purchaser, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any obligation by Purchaser to reimburse
Vulcan for any amounts arising under any indemnification rights of such
distributors and RR Street & Company, Inc. under any such contracts.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all other
liabilities relating to Sellers' exit from the CareFill Dry Cleaning Business,
the RR Street Agreement and any other contracts, agreements or arrangements of
either Seller relating to dry-cleaning applications of perchloroethylene,
including attorneys' fees and costs of defense, settlement or judgment incurred
by the Seller Indemnified Group or the Purchaser Indemnified Group as a result
of such exit, shall be borne by Vulcan.

     Section 6.9  DELIVERIES. Vulcan will deliver on or promptly following
the Closing Date the certificate of title for each owned vehicle that is part of
the Purchased Assets, with proper endorsements evidencing transfer from the
applicable Seller to Purchaser. Vulcan shall also deliver the Purchased Assets
not located on the Purchased Properties to Purchaser as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date (and in no event more than thirty (30) thereafter
unless otherwise mutually agreed), other than those Purchased Assets (such as
books and records) that Vulcan needs to retain in order to provide the services
contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, which retained Purchased
Assets will be provided to Purchaser

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

as promptly as practicable following the termination of such services (and in no
event more than thirty (30) days thereafter unless otherwise mutually agreed).

     Section 6.10 MATERIAL BUSINESS CONTRACTS. Sellers shall promptly advise
Purchaser of any changes to the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.11, to the extent such changes occur after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing.

     Section 6.11  VULCAN LIABILITY. Vulcan shall be jointly and severally
liable for the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements of
the JV hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                             COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

     From and after the date hereof and until the Closing (except with respect
to SECTIONS 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6, which shall survive the Closing in

representatives pursuant hereto shall be held in accordance with, and shall be
subject to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement. As of the Closing Date,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and cease to be of effect to the
extent information and materials relate solely to the Business and SECTION 10.4
shall apply.

Affiliates shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser
shall so advise and cooperate with Vulcan and shall not release or permit to be
released such information without Vulcan's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such information is
otherwise publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by Purchaser
made in breach of this SECTION 7.2 or (b) the release thereof is, in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser, required by any Law (including any rule of any
securities exchange on which Purchaser's or its Affiliates' securities are
traded) or Order to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is bound or
subject; PROVIDED, in the case of this clause (b), that Purchaser shall take all
reasonable efforts to notify Vulcan prior to making any such disclosure and
shall restrict or cause to be restricted such disclosure to the minimum required
by Law (in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser).

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act (except with the prior
written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
or enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade Commission or the Department
of Justice not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (except with
the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and until the Termination Date shall defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any party, including appeals. In
addition to and without limiting the foregoing, upon the six month anniversary
of the date of this Agreement if the transaction has not already received all
requisite antitrust or competition clearances or approvals from any Governmental
Body, each of Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other and Purchaser
shall propose both to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of Purchased Assets or
assets of Purchaser or its Affiliates, or otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the Purchased Assets or the Business as a whole
("OFFER TO CONSENT"), in an effort to avoid or eliminate impediments under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted or
threatened by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any such sale, divestiture or disposition of Assets
pursuant to an Offer to Consent shall be subject to the terms and conditions
specified in SCHEDULE 7.3. After making such Offer to Consent, each of Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to
negotiate a consent decree, hold separate order, or other agreement with any
relevant Governmental Body that is acceptable to that Governmental Body such
that the Governmental Body will allow the Effective Time to occur no later than
the expiration of the time period set forth in SECTION 13.1(c) (the "TERMINATION
DATE"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this SECTION 7.3(d) shall require Purchaser or its Affiliates to
agree to sell, divest, or dispose of the Geismar, Louisiana complex (which
includes the main Geismar plant, as well as the separate EDC facilities owned by
the JV, the recently constructed 5CP facilities and related pipelines and
plumbing) (the "GEISMAR COMPLEX") or any other chemical manufacturing facilities
located in Texas, Louisiana or Alabama (collectively, "PURCHASER'S GULF COAST
PLANTS") or limit its freedom in any significant respect with respect to the
business operations of the Geismar Complex or any of Purchaser's Gulf Coast
plants. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have complied with its
obligations under this SECTION 7.3(d) if (a) Purchaser exercises reasonable best
efforts to reach agreement with a Governmental Body on its Offer to Consent even
if it fails to reach such agreement; or (b) Purchaser defends in good faith any
Legal Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby up until the Termination Date, even if those
Legal Proceedings are not completed as of the Termination Date.

     Section 7.4 VULCAN'S ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, afford to Vulcan's representatives, upon reasonable
notice and without undue interruption to Purchaser's or its Affiliates'
business, access during normal business hours to the books and records and
personnel of the Business pertaining to the operations of the Business prior to
the Closing Date for a period of five (5) years (or such longer period as may
reasonably be requested by Vulcan, during such five (5) year period, with regard
to specific documents or types of document reasonably necessary (x) to enable
Sellers to comply with provisions of applicable Law or (y) in connection with
Sellers' indemnification obligations under ARTICLE XI) following the Closing
Date in connection with financial statements and United States Securities


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

and Exchange Commission reporting obligations, Excluded Liabilities, Excluded
Assets and other reasonable business purposes; PROVIDED that nothing herein
shall limit Vulcan's rights of discovery. Purchaser agrees to hold and to cause
its Affiliates to hold all of the books and records of the Business existing on
the Closing Date or included in the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Purchaser's and its Affiliates' standard record retention policies, PROVIDED
that Purchaser shall not, and shall not permits its Affiliates to, alter or
dispose of any of such books and records for a period of five (5) years from the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law without first
offering in writing at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to such destruction
or disposition to surrender them to Vulcan at Vulcan's sole expense.

     Section 7.5  FURTHER ACTIONS. Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied as promptly as practicable its obligations
hereunder and the conditions precedent to the Closing in ARTICLE IX. After the
Closing, Purchaser will duly execute and deliver such assignments, bills of
sale, deeds, acknowledgments and other instruments of conveyance and transfer as
shall at any time be reasonably necessary or appropriate to convey to Purchaser
the Purchased Assets or to result in the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities. From the execution hereof until the Closing, Purchaser agrees to
promptly notify Vulcan of any known material breach of any representation or
warranty of Purchaser; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in ARTICLE IX to be satisfied, to give rise to any right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE XIII or any indemnification
rights under ARTICLE XI, in each case unless the underlying failure of a
representation or warranty to be true would independently result in a failure of
such condition to be satisfied or give rise to such termination or
indemnification right.

     Section 7.6  USE OF VULCAN'S NAME. Purchaser agrees that (a) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, it shall cease to mark, or shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to cease to mark, products and other property
with the names, marks and other indicia of "Vulcan," "Vulcan Materials," "Vulcan
Chemicals," the Vulcan logo and other similar marks and derivatives of such
names, marks and other indicia, including domain names and copyrighted works
utilizing such names and indicia; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for a period of one
hundred and eighty (180) calendar days following the Closing Date (or for such
longer period as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with Purchaser's
or its Affiliate's use of governmental registrations of products sold or
distributed by the Business after the Closing), Purchaser and its Affiliates may
continue to use or dispose of any inventory, product specifications, manuals and
other accompanying materials, and packaging and shipping materials that bear the
names, marks and other indicia of "Vulcan," "Vulcan Materials," "Vulcan
Chemicals," the Vulcan logo and other similar marks and derivatives of such
names, marks and other indicia, including domain names and copyrighted works
utilizing such names and indicia, in a manner consistent with that employed
immediately prior to the Closing, and (b) it shall not advertise or hold itself
out as Vulcan or an Affiliate thereof.

     Section 7.7  SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS BY PURCHASER PRIOR TO CLOSING. Prior
to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, use any confidential information of Sellers or their respective
Affiliates other than in connection with completing the transactions
contemplated hereby, in connection with the solicitation of customers of the
Business, seek to induce to discontinue or limit their relationships with
Sellers

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

or to conduct any marketing or other customer solicitation activities
outside of the ordinary course of business of Purchaser and its Affiliates,
consistent with past practice, it being understood and agreed that the foregoing
is not intended to prohibit general advertising or solicitations directed to the
public generally or other similar activities conducted in the ordinary course of
business of Purchaser and its Affiliates consistent with past practice and
without making reference hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or using
confidential information of Sellers and their respective Affiliates.

                              ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

     Section 10.1  EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS MATTERS.

     (a) BUSINESS EMPLOYEES. Schedule 10.1(a) lists each Business Employee as of
the date indicated thereon (which shall be no earlier than three (3) Business
Days prior to the date hereof), and each such Business Employee's date of hire,
position, base salary or wages, employment location, union represented or
non-represented status and status as full- or part-time and active or on an
approved leave of absence. Vulcan will provide Purchaser with an updated
Schedule 10.1(a) ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing (and the effective
date of such updated section shall be no earlier than three (3) Business Days
prior to the date of its delivery), based upon new employees hired by the
Business and departures of employees of the Business prior to the Closing.

     (b) OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT. Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
shall make offers of employment (which shall be contingent on the occurrence of
the Closing and which shall be effective as of the Closing Date or as of such
later date as expressly provided under Section 10.1(c) for the commencement of
employment with Purchaser (the "EMPLOYMENT DATE")) to (i) all represented
Business Employees listed on the updated SCHEDULE 10.1(a) and (ii) the
non-represented Business Employees identified by Purchaser on a written list
provided to Vulcan no later than ninety (90) days following the date hereof.
Purchaser shall offer each Business Employee identified in the preceding
sentence employment (A) in a position requiring substantially comparable skills
and abilities as such Business Employee's position with Vulcan

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

requires, (B) with annual base salary, or monthly, weekly or hourly rate of pay,
which is equal to such Business Employee's annual base salary, or monthly,
weekly or hourly rate of pay, as applicable, with Vulcan as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and an opportunity for incentive pay under the incentive
compensation programs provided by Purchaser and its Affiliates to their
similarly situated (based on position and responsibilities, location and rate of
compensation) employees, (C) with a work status (full- or part-time, including
number of hours per week worked) that is not changed from that in effect with
Vulcan or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and (D) with the
same employee benefit plans and policies as applicable to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates (except as otherwise specifically
provided in this SECTION 10.1). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, employment of Business Employees who are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement shall in all events be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such agreements, with such administrative modifications (as agreed
by the union) as may be required to reflect the fact that as of the Closing Date
the Purchaser (or its appropriate Affiliate) shall be the employer party to such
Collective Bargaining Agreements and such other changes (as agreed by the union)
as are necessary to reflect that benefits will be provided under Purchaser's (or
its appropriate Affiliate's) plans. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall
require or be construed or interpreted as requiring Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser to continue the employment of any of their employees (including
Transferred Business Employees) following the Closing Date, or to prevent
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser from changing the terms and conditions of
employment (including compensation and benefits) of any of their employees
(including Transferred Business Employees) following the Closing Date, subject
to Purchaser's obligations under SECTIONS 10.1(f) and (j).

     (c) COMMENCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT WITH PURCHASER. Each Business
Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser and commences employment with Purchaser or such Affiliate shall be
referred to as a "TRANSFERRED BUSINESS EMPLOYEE" for purposes of this Agreement;
PROVIDED that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
such Business Employee who is absent from work on the Closing Date due to a
vacation, sick leave, jury duty, funeral leave, or personal day shall be
considered to have commenced active employment with Purchaser or such Affiliate
effective as of the Closing Date. With respect to any Business Employee who
accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, but
who on the Closing Date is on short-term or long-term disability, military
leave, leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act, or other leave of
absence approved by Vulcan or an Affiliate of Vulcan (other than due to a
vacation, sick leave, jury duty, funeral leave, or personal day), Purchaser or
an Affiliate of Purchaser shall employ such Business Employee for the period
beginning after such absence if such Business Employee returns to employment in
accordance with the terms of such employee's leave; PROVIDED that such Business
Employee commences active employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
no later than (i) in the case of short-term disability, the end of Vulcan's
long-term disability elimination period and with a written physician's release
to return to work that is satisfactory to Purchaser, or (ii) in the case of all
other absences, one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days after the Closing
Date (unless a longer period is required by applicable Law). Any Business
Employee who is on an approved leave on the Closing Date and commences active
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser in accordance with the
preceding sentence will cease employment with Vulcan at the end of such leave of


                                      -40
<PAGE>

absence and the date of commencement of active employment with Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser shall be his or her Employment Date.

     (d)  ACCESS TO BUSINESS EMPLOYEES. From the date following the date
hereof that is mutually agreed upon between the parties (which shall not be
later than thirty (30) days following the date hereof) through the Closing Date,
Vulcan shall cooperate with Purchaser in permitting Purchaser reasonable access
to Business Employees (i) to interview during normal business hours any
non-represented Business Employees on a voluntary basis, (ii) to seek consent
from any non-represented Business Employees to perform background checks and
drug testing, consistent with Purchaser's policies, (iii) to communicate to the
Business Employees any information concerning employment offers and employment
with Purchaser or its Affiliates in accordance with this Agreement, and (iv) to
meet with Business Employees who are union officers or representatives, in each
case subject to prior approval by Vulcan of the date, time and duration of such
access so as to minimize disruption to the Business, and such other procedures
as shall be mutually agreed to between the parties.

     (e) SERVICE CREDITING AND BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY. Purchaser (or its
appropriate Affiliate) agrees to give each Transferred Business Employee service
credit for all employment and employee benefits and compensation related
purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and
levels of benefit accruals (but not for benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) under any employee
benefit or compensation plan, program and arrangement adopted or maintained by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which such Transferred Business Employee
is eligible to participate for all periods of employment credited by Vulcan and
its Affiliates prior to such Transferred Business Employee's Employment Date
under Vulcan's pension plans. Purchaser agrees that (i) to the extent that any
Transferred Business Employee has satisfied in whole or in part any annual
deductible under a Vulcan welfare benefit plan, or has paid any out-of-pocket
expenses pursuant to any such welfare benefit plan co-insurance provision, in
each case, with respect to the calendar year in which the Employment Date
occurs, such amount shall be counted toward the satisfaction of any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket expense maximum, respectively, under Purchaser's
applicable benefit plans and programs provided to Transferred Business Employees
and (ii) with respect to the participation of the Transferred Business Employees
in the welfare benefit plans and programs of Purchaser and its Affiliates, any
preexisting conditions (to the extent otherwise covered under Purchaser's plans)
or waiting periods or required physical examinations, except physical
examinations required by a third party as a condition to supplemental life
insurance coverage above the levels of insurance provided by Purchaser's (or its
appropriate Affiliate's) group life insurance plan, shall be waived.

     (f) RETIREE MEDICAL. With respect to all Transferred Business
Employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements under Vulcan's or any of its
Affiliate's retiree medical programs prior to the applicable Employment Date
with Purchaser or its appropriate Affiliate (the "ELIGIBLE TRANSFERRED BUSINESS
EMPLOYEES"), Vulcan shall provide the retiree medical insurance coverage for
such Transferred Business Employees and be solely liable for coverage pursuant
to the terms of any such retiree medical programs; PROVIDED that such Eligible
Transferred Business Employee discontinues employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates prior to the fifth anniversary of the

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Closing Date. If an Eligible Transferred Business Employee discontinues
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates on or after the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide the retiree medical insurance coverage
for such Eligible Transferred Business Employee and be solely liable for
coverage pursuant to the terms of Purchaser's retiree medical program (and any
terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to
represented Eligible Transferred Business Employees), and such Eligible
Transferred Business Employees shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
Purchaser's or its Affiliate's retiree medical plans. With respect to
Transferred Business Employees who are not Eligible Transferred Business
Employees as of the applicable Employment Date, Purchaser shall provide the
retiree medical insurance coverage for such Transferred Business Employees and
be solely liable for coverage pursuant to the terms of Purchaser's retiree
medical program (and any terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement
with respect to represented Transferred Business Employees) subject to such
employee's satisfaction of Purchaser's normal eligibility requirements for
retiree medical coverage (taking into account SECTION 10.1(e)) and the
additional requirement that such Transferred Business Employee have at least
five (5) years of actual service with Purchaser or its Affiliates from and after
the applicable Employment Date with Purchaser.

     (g) CESSATION OF PARTICIPATION IN VULCAN'S BENEFIT PLANS. Effective as of
each Transferred Business Employee's Employment Date, such Transferred Business
Employee shall cease to accrue benefits under all employee benefit plans and
programs of Vulcan and its Affiliates. Effective as of the Transferred Business
Employee's Employment Date, Vulcan shall cause such Transferred Business
Employee to be fully vested in his or her accrued benefits under Vulcan's
Chemicals Hourly Employee Retirement Plan (which is the pension plan referred to
in the Collective Bargaining Agreements) and Vulcan Material Company Retirement
Income Plan for Salaried Employees, and Vulcan shall be solely liable for the
pre-Closing accrued and vested benefit obligations under Vulcan's Chemicals
Hourly Employee Retirement Plan and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

     (h) WELFARE BENEFIT CLAIMS. Vulcan shall be liable for and shall hold
Purchaser harmless from and against all claims for welfare benefits by each
Transferred Business Employee that are incurred prior to such Transferred
Business Employee's Employment Date. For dependents of a Transferred Business
Employee, medical expenses incurred and expenses for continuous periods of
hospitalization commencing but not completed as of such Transferred Business
Employee's Employment Date shall be the responsibility of Vulcan. Vulcan's
liability shall end when the hospitalization ends. Purchaser shall be liable for
and shall hold Vulcan harmless from and against all claims for welfare benefits
by a Transferred Business Employee that are incurred on or after such
Transferred Business Employee's Employment Date. For purposes hereof, the
following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental
death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon
the death or accident giving rise to such benefits, (ii) health, dental, vision
and/or prescription drug benefits, on the date such services, materials or
supplies were provided (except as provided above with respect to dependents of
Transferred Business Employees) and (iii) disability income benefits, on the
date of disability as determined by the disability carrier for the individual.

     (i) ASSUMPTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. Effective as of the
Closing Date and subject to any required union consent, Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser shall assume and be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations under the collective bargaining agreements or other contracts listed
in SCHEDULE 10.1(i) (the "Collective Bargaining

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Agreements") that arise after the Effective Time with respect to union or
represented Transferred Business Employees, with such administrative
modifications (as agreed by the union) as may be required to reflect the fact
that as of the Closing Date the Purchaser (or its appropriate Affiliate) shall
be the employer party to such Collective Bargaining Agreements and such other
changes (as agreed by the union) as are necessary to reflect that benefits will
be provided under Purchaser's (or its appropriate Affiliate's) plans.

     (j) SEVERANCE. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide, and be
solely liable for, severance pay and benefits to each Transferred Business
Employee whose employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates terminates.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the two-(2) year period
following the Closing Date, each non-represented Transferred Business Employee
whose employment terminates under circumstances entitling such employee to
severance pursuant to the terms of Purchaser's Notice and Severance Pay Plan
attached hereto as SCHEDULE 10.1(j) (the "PURCHASER SEVERANCE PLAN"), shall
receive the severance pay and benefits set forth in the Purchaser Severance Plan
(taking into account SECTION 10.1(e) hereof). With respect to non-represented
Business Employees to whom Purchaser does not provide a job offer in accordance
with SECTION 10.1(b) (whether due to a breach of SECTION 10.1(b) or due to the
fact that Purchaser did not include such Business Employee on the list required
by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 10.1(b)) or any non-represented
Business Employee who declines a job offer which requires "relocation" (as
defined below) and whose employment is terminated by Vulcan within one hundred
and twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing Date (or in the case of
Business Employees who provide transition services to Purchaser at Purchaser's
request following the Closing Date, ninety (90) calendar days after the
cessation of Vulcan's provision of such services, and in the case of Business
Employees who are on leave as of the Closing Date, ninety (90) calendar days
following the end of such leave) (collectively referred to herein as
"Non-Transferred Business Employees"), Purchaser agrees, following receipt of an
itemized statement, to reimburse Vulcan promptly for the severance pay, costs of
the benefits set forth on SCHEDULE 10.1(j) and costs of outplacement services
(such outplacement services in no circumstances to exceed $250,000 in the
aggregate or $5,500 per person) (including, in each case, any withholding and
employer-paid employment taxes) payable or provided to such terminated
Non-Transferred Business Employees in accordance with SCHEDULE 10.1(j). For
purposes of the reimbursement obligations under this SECTION 10.1(j), the cost
of medical benefits shall be at the premium or premium equivalent amount. For
purposes hereof, a job offer will be deemed to require "relocation" if it is for
a position at a work location that requires such Business Employee to travel
more than an additional twenty-five (25) miles (one way each day) to work than
such Business Employee traveled immediately prior to the Closing Date.

     (k) 401(K) PLAN. Each Transferred Business Employee who
participated or who was eligible to participate in Vulcan's 401(k) Plan shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period or delay, in
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan applicable to the Transferred Business Employees.
Purchaser will permit each Transferred Business Employee at his or her option to
transfer his or her account balances in Vulcan's 401(k) Plan to Purchaser's

     (l) COBRA. Purchaser shall be responsible for the administration of and
shall assume any and all obligations arising under the continuation coverage
requirements of section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
("COBRA") or other applicable Law with respect to the Transferred Business
Employees and their beneficiaries who experience a "Qualifying Event" (as
defined in COBRA) after the applicable Employment Date. Vulcan shall be
responsible for the administration of any and all obligations arising under the
continuation coverage requirements of COBRA with respect to Business Employees
and their beneficiaries who experience a "Qualifying Event" (as defined in
COBRA) on or before the applicable Employment Date.

     (m) WARN. To the extent that any obligations under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq.) (the "WARN
ACT"), or under any similar Law (referred to collectively as "WARN
OBLIGATIONS"), might arise as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby, it is agreed that (i) Purchaser shall be responsible for any WARN
Obligations arising as a result of any employment loss by Transferred Business
Employees occurring from and after the applicable Employment Date, (ii)
Purchaser shall reimburse Vulcan for any pay in lieu of notice and any WARN
Obligations, including the cost of benefits and any withholding and employer
paid employment taxes, with respect to Non-Transferred Business Employees whose
employment was or is terminated by Vulcan prior to or within one hundred and
twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing Date that is (A) imposed on Vulcan
or its Affiliates due to Purchaser's failure to provide Vulcan with the list
required by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 10.1(b) at least
seventy (70) days prior to the Closing Date, due to Purchaser's breach of
Section 10.1(b) or due to a Business Employee declining Purchaser's offer due to
"relocation" or (B) retroactively imposed on Vulcan or its Affiliates as a
result of the actions of Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date. For
purposes of the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, as the information becomes
available, Purchaser shall provide Vulcan with written list(s) of those Business
Employees who are offered employment with Purchaser and those Business Employees
who decline offers of employment by Purchaser and, if the WARN Act is triggered
or is reasonably expected to be triggered, Vulcan shall provide such Business
Employees with WARN notices within ten (10) Business Days of Vulcan's receipt of
Purchaser's list(s). Purchaser shall only be obligated to reimburse Vulcan for
the costs associated with a notice period to the extent such period does not end
prior to the Effective Time. In no event shall Purchaser be obligated to
reimburse Vulcan for retroactively imposed WARN Obligations for Non-Transferred
Business Employees that arise solely due to Vulcan's termination of non-Business
Employees following the Closing Date.

     (n) VACATION PAY/PAID TIME OFF. Vulcan will pay each Transferred Business
Employee for any and all accrued but unused vacation and paid time off to which
he or she is entitled effective as of his or her Employment Date.
Non-represented Transferred Business Employees will be eligible to earn and take
vacation benefits under Purchaser's policy commencing on their respective
Employment Dates (taking into account SECTION 10.1(e)). Represented Transferred
Business Employees will be eligible to earn and take vacation benefits
consistent with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement
commencing on their respective Employment Dates (taking into account SECTION
10.1(e)).

     (o) RETENTION. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent reasonably determined to be necessary by Vulcan, Vulcan
may grant

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

Business Employees cash retention bonus awards in amounts and pursuant
to terms to be determined by Vulcan (the "RETENTION AWARDS"), with such
allocations (by name and job title of recipient), amounts and terms to be
subject to the approval of Purchaser which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Vulcan for the costs of the
Retention Awards up to an aggregate amount of $500,000 of Retention Awards. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Vulcan shall provide
Purchaser with its proposed Retention Award allocations (by name and job title
of recipient) and terms, and Purchaser shall respond to Vulcan's proposal as
promptly as possible (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of receipt).

     Section 10.2.  TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT. Effective at the Closing,
Purchaser and Vulcan shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
on or before December 10, 2004 (and in any event prior to the Closing Date),
Purchaser will (i) select from the services set forth on Exhibit A to the
Transition Services Agreement those services that Purchaser desires and (ii)
specify the applicable term(s) for which Purchaser desires to have such services
provided (which shall not exceed six (6) months following the Closing Date), and
such Exhibit A will be revised to reflect such services and terms.

     Section 10.3. PRORATION; OTHER CLOSING DATE ADJUSTMENTS. Prior to the
Closing, Sellers will operate the Business, hold the Purchased Assets and retain
the Assumed Liabilities for their own account, and following the Closing,
Purchaser shall operate the Business, hold the Purchased Assets and assume the
Assumed Liabilities for its own account. Thus, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein (including SECTION 2.2), items of income and expense, as
described herein, shall be prorated as of the Effective Time, and settled
between Vulcan and Purchaser as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date (and in no event more than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing
Date), whether or not such adjustment would normally be made as of such time.
Items of proration will be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless
otherwise agreed by the parties. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser
shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to Vulcan complete and accurate
copies of all invoices, billing statements and similar documents received by
Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Effective Time and relating to the
Business as conducted prior to the Closing Date, and Vulcan shall promptly
forward to Purchaser complete and accurate copies of all invoices and billing
statements received by Sellers relating to the Business as conducted from and
after the Closing Date. To the extent the exact amounts of any real property
taxes or other items to be prorated are not known within sixty (60) calendar
days of the Closing Date, the parties shall make reasonable estimates of such
taxes or other items for purposes of making prorations and shall thereafter
adjust the prorations as promptly as practicable after such exact amounts are
finally ascertained. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for payments to
vendors with respect to items of personal property and raw materials that have
been ordered but not delivered as of the Effective Time. For purposes hereof,
items of proration and other adjustments shall consist solely of: (i) rental
payments under the Real Property Leases; (ii) personal and real property taxes
and assessments arising from the Owned Real Property or otherwise from the
Purchased Assets (which shall be prorated as provided in SECTION 1.4(i)); (iii)
payments under Business Contracts relating to goods or services to be delivered
or provided in whole or in part following the Closing Date; (iv) prepaid
expenses (including insurance to the extent relating to matters set forth in
SECTION 1.1(d)); and (v) product rebates and incentives.

     Section 10.4. CONFIDENTIALITY. From and after the Closing:

     (a) Except as and to the extent required by Law or provided herein, without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, Sellers shall not, and shall not permit
any of their officers, directors, Affiliates, employees, agents or
representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") to, directly or indirectly,
disclose or permit the disclosure of any information ("CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION") relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets; it being
understood and agreed that the entry into and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the financial and operating impact thereof on
Vulcan, will be disclosed by Vulcan as appropriate in Vulcan's public filings
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

     (b) The restrictions contained in this SECTION 10.4 shall not
apply to Confidential Information that becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure in violation of this Section 10.4.

     (c) If Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates receives a subpoena,
discovery demand or request for any documents or information to which
Confidential Information is arguably responsive, or is required pursuant to any
Law or stock exchange listing requirement to disclose such Confidential
Information, or is reasonably necessary in connection with any litigation
involving the Purchased Assets or the Business, Purchaser shall be promptly
notified to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, the parties hereto shall cooperate with respect to the
response to the disclosure request or requirement to the response in order to
properly comply with such request or requirement. In the event that a Seller
includes Purchaser's Confidential Information in a submission made in connection
with a review by a Governmental Body or a stock exchange review of, or pursuant
to any Law or stock exchange rule concerning, the transactions contemplated
hereby, which submission is not deemed confidential pursuant to applicable Law
or stock exchange rule, other than disclosure of the transactions contemplated
hereby as required under applicable securities laws and stock exchange
requirements, each Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts at Purchaser's
expense to (i) take all necessary action to request that the submission be
designated as a confidential filing by the stock exchange or Governmental Body
consistent with the terms of this SECTION 10.4 and (ii) submit only that portion
of the Confidential Information that it reasonably believes it is compelled to
disclose. No disclosure made in compliance with the foregoing shall be deemed a
breach of this SECTION 10.4.

     (d) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees: (i) that money damages would not
be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this SECTION 10.4;
(ii) in addition to all other remedies which Purchaser may have, Purchaser shall
be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as
a remedy for such breach; and (iii) to waive, and to use reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such specific performance, injunctive or other
equitable relief.

     Section 10.5. TRANSFER TAXES. Sellers and Purchaser shall each pay any
Transfer Taxes imposed on it by Law as a result of the sale of the Purchased
Assets pursuant to this Agreement, but, notwithstanding such requirements of
Law, Purchaser shall bear all such Transfer Taxes. Accordingly, if either Seller
is required at Law to pay any such Transfer Taxes,


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall promptly reimburse such Seller for such amounts. Each Seller and
Purchaser shall timely file their own Transfer Tax returns as required by Law
and shall notify the other when such filings have been made. Each Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate and consult with each other prior to filing such
Transfer Tax returns to ensure that all such returns are filed in a consistent
manner. Sellers and Purchaser agree to timely sign and deliver such certificates
or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or
reduce) such Transfer Taxes. Each party shall have the right to seek a refund of
any and all Transfer Taxes paid pursuant to this SECTION 10.5 at its own
expense. If so requested, the other party shall use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the party seeking such refund. In the event that a refund claim
is successful, the applicable Seller on receiving such refund shall promptly
remit to Purchaser all amounts refunded in respect of such claim, after
deducting any costs actually incurred by Sellers in connection with such claim.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                  SURVIVAL, INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

     Section 11.1. SURVIVAL.

     (a) All representations and warranties contained herein, and the right to
commence any claim with respect thereto, shall terminate upon the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, except that (i) the representations and
warranties contained in SECTION 4.7 (Taxes) shall survive until thirty (30) days
after the end of the period of the applicable statute of limitations, (ii) the
warranties contained in SECTIONS 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 4.2
(Authorization of Agreement), 4.8(a) (Real Property) (solely to the extent that
either Seller has represented that it holds title to the Owned Real Property,
subject to the Permitted Exceptions), 4.9(a) (Tangible Personal Property;
Personal Property Leases) (solely to the extent that either Seller has
represented that it holds title to the owned Purchased Assets, subject to the
Permitted Exceptions), 5.1 (Organization and Good Standing) and 5.2
(Authorization of Agreement) shall survive without limitation as to time, and
(iii) the warranties contained in SECTIONS 4.16(b), (c) and (h) (Environmental
Matters) shall terminate upon the first anniversary of the Closing Date, while
the warranties contained in SECTIONS 4.16(a), (d) - (g) and (i) (Environmental
Matters) shall terminate as of the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in
the event written notice of any bona fide claim for indemnification under
SECTION 11.2(a)(i) or SECTION 11.2(b)(i) shall have been given in accordance
herewith within the applicable survival period setting forth such claim in
reasonable detail (including a reasonable specification of the legal and factual
basis for such claim and the Loss incurred to the extent then known), the
warranties that are the subject of such indemnification claim shall survive with
respect to that claim only until such time as the claim is fully and finally
resolved. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained herein
that by their terms are to be performed following the Closing Date shall survive
the Closing and continue in effect in accordance with their terms.

     (b) After the Closing, other than the reimbursement provisions
expressly set forth in SCHEDULE 6.3, the indemnification provided for in this
ARTICLE XI shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages for any
breach hereof or the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements herein
by either party hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not limit
the right of either party hereto to seek specific enforcement or injunctive or
similar


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

non-monetary relief for a breach of such covenants or agreements;
provided, further, however, that the foregoing shall not limit claims of common
law fraud by a party to this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     (c) In calculating any amount of Losses recoverable pursuant to SECTION
11.2 or 11.3, the amount of such Losses shall be (i) reduced by (A) any
recoveries from third parties pursuant to indemnification (or otherwise) with
respect thereto, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
obtaining such third party payment, and (B) the amount of any net Tax benefit
actually realized resulting from the incurrence or payment of such Losses, and
(ii) increased by the amount of any net Tax cost incurred as a result of the
receipt of such indemnity payments (grossed up for such increase). The parties
agree to treat any indemnification payment pursuant to this ARTICLE XI as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be
liable to any Indemnified Party for special, incidental, indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary Losses as a result of any breach of this
Agreement or other agreements referred to herein or of any private right of
action that any party may have hereunder against another party hereto.

     (a) Vulcan hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Group harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments,

(collectively, "LOSSES"), actually incurred by any of them to the extent arising
out of or resulting from:

          (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Sellers herein,
     disregarding any qualifications regarding materiality or Material Adverse
     Effect (other than such qualifications contained in SECTION 4.6(a) or
     4.6(b), SECTION 4.16(b), (c) and (h), Section 4.20 or, as used in SECTION
     4.8, the definition of Permitted Exceptions) or dollar amount (other than
     dollar amounts specified in SECTION 4.11);

          (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Sellers herein;

          (iv) any Excluded Asset; and

          (v) the matters addressed in SCHEDULE 6.3, as provided therein.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Vulcan shall not be
liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in SECTION
11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(a)(ii) (other than any breach of any covenant requiring a

an aggregate amount in excess of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) in
respect of all Losses for the matters set forth in SECTIONS 11.2(a)(i) and
11.2(a)(ii) (other than any breach of any covenant requiring a Seller to make a
specific payment to Purchaser hereunder or requiring performance after the
Closing Date).

          (b) Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
     Seller Indemnified Group harmless from and against any and all Losses
     actually incurred by any of them to the extent arising out of or resulting
     from:

               (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Purchaser
          herein;

               (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser herein;
          and

               (iii) except to the extent Vulcan is obligated to indemnify
          Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) or (ii) with respect to such
          liabilities, any Assumed Liabilities.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not
be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in SECTION

Purchaser to make a specific payment to a Seller hereunder or requiring
performance after the Closing Date) unless (x) a claim is timely asserted during
any applicable survival period specified in SECTION 11.1(a), (y) the Loss with

In addition, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,

Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) in respect of all Losses for the matters

requiring performance after the Closing Date).

     term "disposal" shall include any arrangement for disposal and any disposal

     mitigate any such fines or penalties (except that Purchaser agrees that it
     shall, and it shall cause its Affiliates, to cooperate with Vulcan in
     planning and performing at Vulcan's sole expense any supplemental
     environmental project that Vulcan may agree to implement in lieu of payment
     of any fines or penalties otherwise applicable to the extent that
     cooperation by Purchaser or implementation of such project would not
     unreasonably interfere with its operation of the Business); and

          (viii) OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - other than to the extent of
     liabilities of Purchaser as provided for in SECTIOn 11.3(b) or the

     notwithstanding anything contained in SECTION 11.3(a) to the contrary,
     contesting, litigating or conducting Environmental Remedial Action (or
     preparing to undertake any of the foregoing) after the Closing Date at, on
     or under the Purchased Properties or any Environmental Remedial Action with
     respect to Hazardous Materials migrating from the Purchased Properties (and
     the continuation of the on-going remediation presently being conducted at
     the Geismar Complex for Oxychlorination-Ethylene Dichloride at certain
     off-site docking facilities used by Sellers), as well as any Losses after
     the Closing Date constituting natural resource damages asserted or imposed
     by any Governmental Body or any trustee for such resources to the extent
     arising at, on or under the Purchased Properties or as a result of any
     Hazardous Materials migrating from the Purchased Properties (for the
     avoidance of doubt, the discovery of any matter(s) for which Vulcan is
     responsible under SECTION 11.3(a) during the course of Purchaser's actions
     under this SECTION 11.3(b)(i) shall continue to be the responsibility of
     Vulcan and shall not be considered Purchaser Assumed Environmental
     Liabilities solely because such matter(s) are discovered in connection with
     an Environmental Remedial Action);

          (ii) INJURIES TO EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND VENDORS - Legal
     Proceedings or claims after the Closing Date by Transferred Business
     Employees or by other natural persons serving as contractors,
     subcontractors or vendors of members of the Purchaser Indemnified Group or
     invitees at or on the Purchased Properties for personal injury or wrongful
     death resulting from exposure to Hazardous Materials in connection with the
     operation of the Business (including claims and Legal Proceedings by
     spouses, children or other dependents of any of the foregoing, or the
     heirs, trustees or representatives of any of the foregoing, arising from
     such injuries or death), in each case to the extent such injuries or death
     were caused by such exposure after the Effective Time (regardless of
     whether such Legal Proceedings or claims are made directly by or on behalf
     of the allegedly exposed individual or indirectly through a cross-claim,
     third party claim or separate Legal Proceeding for contribution or
     indemnity brought by another Person against any member of the Seller
     Indemnified Group or the Purchaser Indemnified Group);

          (iii) PRODUCT LIABILITY - Other than to the extent of liabilities of
     Vulcan as provided for in SECTION 11.3(a), claims by Third Party

          (v) POST-CLOSING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - liabilities under
     Environmental Laws to the extent resulting from the operation of the
     Business after the Closing Date (except to the extent arising from actions,
     omissions, events, facts or circumstances occurring or existing prior to
     the Effective Time); and

                                      -52-
<PAGE>


          (vi) OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - other than to the extent of
     liabilities of Vulcan as provided for in SECTION 11.3(a) or the liabilities
     of Purchaser under Section 11.3(b)(i) through (v), fifty percent (50%) of
     all other liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
     Environmental Laws;

     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall have no liability for, or any
     obligation to indemnify Vulcan for, any of the foregoing to the extent any
     such liability results from a breach of Sellers' warranties set forth in
     SECTION 4.16(b), (c) or (h) for which Vulcan is obligated to indemnify
     Purchaser.

     (c) [Reserved]

     (d) Purchaser agrees that it shall implement following the Closing Date a
program of health and safety testing of Transferred Business Employees as
required by then applicable law. For a period of one year following the Closing
Date, Purchaser further agrees that it shall give Vulcan as much advance written
notice as is reasonably practicable if Purchaser or its Affiliates determines to
discontinue all or a portion of the Business where such discontinuation results
in the termination of a sufficient number of employees so as to implicate the
notice obligations under the WARN Act.

     (e) Except as expressly provided under SECTION 11.2(a)(i) with respect to
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in SECTIONS 4.16(b),
(c) and (h), the procedural provisions set forth in SECTIONS 11.4 and 11.5 and
the covenants of Sellers expressly set forth in SECTION 6.8, the indemnification
provided for in this SECTION 11.3 shall be the exclusive remedy for all matters
relating to violations of Environmental Laws, all Releases of Hazardous
Materials, all exposures of natural persons to Hazardous Materials and the other
matters addressed in this SECTION 11.3, as well as all matters in respect of any
breaches of any of Sellers' representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder relating thereto and any private right of action that either party
might have under any Environmental Law; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the right of either party hereto to seek specific enforcement or
injunctive or similar non-monetary relief for a breach of such covenants or
agreements; provided, further, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to
claims of common law fraud by a party to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 11.4. PROCEDURES FOR INDEMNIFICATION. Whenever a claim shall arise
for indemnification under SECTION 11.2 or SECTION 11.3, with the exception of
claims for litigation expenses in respect of litigation as to which a notice of
claim, as provided in this SECTION 11.4, has previously been given, which
expenses shall be funded on an ongoing basis, the Person entitled to
indemnification (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the party from
which indemnification is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of such claim and,
when known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in the event of any claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from or
in connection with any claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall give such notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party not
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the time any response to the asserted
claim is required, if possible, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business
Days following receipt of notice thereof (PROVIDED that failure to timely notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that


                                      -53-

<PAGE>

the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure). Following
receipt of notice of a claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the party
reasonably expected to bear fifty percent (50%) or more of any Losses in
connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding shall have the right to assume
the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceedings and to control any
Environmental Remedial Action that may be required as a result of such claim or
Legal Proceeding, at its cost and expense, and shall have the right to retain
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the other party) to defend any such claim
or Legal Proceeding, and the controlling party shall not be liable to the other
party for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses (except as expressly
provided to the contrary herein) with respect to the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding, other than reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the other party for any period during which the controlling party has not
assumed the defense thereof. The other party shall have the option of joining
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding (which shall be at the sole cost
and expense of such other party) with counsel not reasonably objected to by the
controlling party and counsel for each party shall, to the extent consistent
with such counsel's professional responsibilities, cooperate with the other
party and any counsel designated by that party. In effecting the settlement or
compromise of, or consenting to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any
such claim or Legal Proceeding, the parties shall act in good faith, shall
consult with the other and shall enter into only such settlement or compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment as the other party shall consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided, that
Purchaser may withhold consent to any compromise or settlement that would
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business). An Indemnifying
Party or an Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall not be liable for any
settlement, compromise or judgment or other Losses not made in accordance with
the preceding sentence. In connection with any Environmental Remedial Action,
the controlling party shall consult with the other party on a regular basis and
shall consider in good faith and make reasonable efforts to address any
recommendations of the other party relating to such Environmental Remedial
Action. Unless an emergency action is required to address conditions that
present an imminent and substantial endangerment or in other exigent
circumstances, an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for Losses associated
with any Environmental Remedial Action undertaken by the other party without the
Indemnifying Party's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (provided, that Purchaser may withhold consent to any
compromise or settlement that would unreasonably interfere with the operation of
the Business). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any
proceedings or claims, to the extent relating to Criminal Violations, may be
controlled exclusively by the Indemnifying Party alleged to have engaged in the
applicable criminal violations (provided, that Purchaser shall not be required
to effect or participate in any compromise or settlement that would unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Business).

     Section 11.5 INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER SELLER THIRD PARTY INSURANCE
POLICIES.

     (a) In accordance with the assignment of insurance rights and claims in
Section 1.1(d)(2), Purchaser shall have the right to make claims for coverage
for Assumed Liabilities under the Seller Third Party Insurance Policies, subject
to the following provisions:

          (i) Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 11.5,
     Purchaser shall have the right to pursue insurance coverage under Seller
     Third Party Insurance Policies for claims or Legal Proceedings related to
     the Business, the Purchased Assets or


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

     the Assumed Liabilities for which Purchaser is liable under this Agreement
     (each a "Subject Claim"), including providing notice and tender of claims
     to insurers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Sellers shall use reasonable best
     efforts, and reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, in Purchaser's pursuit of
     insurance coverage under Seller Third Party Insurance Policies for Subject
     Claims, and to effectuate the assignment of rights and claims thereto in
     Section 1.1(d), including making available to Purchaser copies of all
     Seller Third Party Insurance Policies and the status of any applicable
     limits thereon (to the extent such Policies and information exist in their
     files).

          (ii) If, for whatever reason, an issuer of Seller Third Party
     Insurance Policies has not reimbursed Purchaser for payments made by
     Purchaser on a Subject Claim, then Purchaser may take whatever action it
     deems reasonable (including filing any Legal Proceeding against any Person)
     to effectuate such coverage, at its sole cost and expense. For example,
     Purchaser shall have the right to commence Legal Proceedings, including an
     action for declaratory judgment or damages, against an issuer of Seller
     Third Party Insurance Policies for coverage of Subject Claims under this
     Section in its own name or the name of the Sellers; PROVIDED that the
     Sellers shall be notified of any such Legal Proceeding before it is filed
     and shall be given an opportunity to join in any such Legal Proceeding at
     their cost and expense if they elect to do so. Whether they elect to
     participate directly or not, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate in such
     Legal Proceeding. Purchaser's commencement of a Legal Proceeding against an
     issuer of a Seller Third Party Insurance Policy shall be subject to
     Sellers' consent, which consent may not be unreasonably delayed or
     withheld. Sellers shall not withhold consent solely on the grounds that
     such an action may impair insurance limits of Seller Third Party Insurance
     Policies.

          (iii) Purchaser shall provide prompt written notice to Seller of all
     claims made, Legal Proceedings commenced and Third Party Proceeds received
     pursuant to this Section by any member of the Purchaser Indemnified Group,
     including with respect to Seller Third Party Insurance Policies. Sellers
     shall reimburse Purchaser for any Losses indemnified by Purchaser which are
     paid to Sellers as Third Party Proceeds.

          (iv) Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for out-of-pocket costs,
     expenses and fees, including outside attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred
     by Sellers after the Closing Date in connection with providing cooperation
     to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.5.

          (v) For purposes of the exhaustion of any limits that apply to
     coverage available under any Seller Third Party Insurance Policies or the
     exhaustion of any limits that apply to any deductible or retention
     (including under any fronted or retrospectively rated policies) with
     respect to such policies, amounts shall be allocated to the policies on a
     first come/first served basis, meaning that amounts shall be allocated to
     such limits in the order in which such amounts were paid by or on behalf of
     Purchaser or Sellers, but with the following restrictions: (i) the Top
     Excess Layer shall be reserved exclusively for Sellers; and (ii) Purchaser
     shall have the right to allocate Environmental/Pollution Insurance Claims
     to Seller Third Party Insurance Policies issued prior to 1986 ("Pre-86
     Policies") only to the extent that such claims shall not erode annual
     aggregate limits


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

     under such policies, and provided that Sellers shall have the right and
     sole discretion to enter into settlement agreements (including "buy-out"
     agreements) at any time with respect to one or more Pre-86 Policies that
     extinguish or otherwise adversely affect Sellers' and Purchaser's rights to
     coverage for Environmental/Pollution Insurance Claims; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
     that Sellers shall not enter into a buy-out agreement releasing coverage
     under a Pre-86 Policy for products/completed operations claims; and that
     Sellers shall pay Purchaser 15% of the settlement payment (less
     out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees, including third party fees and
     outside attorneys' fees, incurred by Sellers as transaction costs in
     connection with the buy-out) received by Sellers from any buy-out agreement
     that releases an insurer in full from all coverage for
     Environmental/Pollution Insurance Claims under a Pre-86 Policy, such
     payment to be made to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after Sellers
     receive such settlement payment. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall
     have the right to enter a buy-out agreement of Environmental/Pollution
     Insurance Claims at any time, even after Purchaser has allocated one or
     more Environmental/Pollution Insurance Claims to Pre-86 Policies but has
     not received any Third Party Proceeds for those Claims.

          (vi) With respect to the application of the first come/first served
     approach set forth in Section 11.5(a)(v), with the exception of Section
     11.5(a)(v)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, each of the Purchaser and Sellers
     shall be obligated to act in good faith and to avoid taking any actions for
     the purpose or with the intention of accelerating or delaying claims
     payments or losses in order to obtain some advantage with respect to the
     exhaustion of applicable limits. Purchaser shall not enter into any
     agreement regarding any commutation, buy-out, buy-back or relinquishment of
     the Seller Third Party Insurance Policies. In addition, Purchaser shall not
     enter into any other agreement or settle any dispute, claim or Legal
     Proceeding with respect to Seller Third Party Insurance Policies without
     the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     (b) To the extent that an issuer of Third Party Insurance Policies or
another third party is or may be liable to, but has not yet assumed the defense
of, paid defense costs, or indemnified, Purchaser in a Subject Claim for which
the Purchaser is liable under Sections 11.2 or 11.3, Purchaser shall be
obligated to provide such defense or indemnity to the Seller or to advance the
funds therefor to the Seller pending the receipt of Third Party Proceeds, if
any, and to bear the costs of pursuing such Third Party Proceeds. In the absence
of Third Party Proceeds (for instance, because there is no available insurance
or because insurers have declined to pay or delayed payment), Purchaser shall be
required to bear the full defense or indemnity costs for which Purchaser is
liable under this Agreement, without reduction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Purchaser may pursue any rights to pursue insurance coverage for such costs.

     (c) To the extent of any payment by Purchaser of any amount under this
Article XI on a given Subject Claim, Purchaser shall be subrogated to rights
which Sellers have or may have against another Person (other than another member
of the Seller Indemnified Group), subject to the restrictions set forth in
Section 11.5 herein. Purchaser shall have the right under this Section 11.5 to
pursue or prosecute any such subrogated rights, in its own name or in the name
of the Sellers against another Person, under Purchaser's sole control and at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, but subject to the provisions set forth in
Section 11.5 herein.

     Section 11.6  INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER PURCHASER WORKERS COMPENSATION
POLICIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller's
responsibility to indemnify Purchaser for claims or Legal Proceedings under
Section 11.3(a)(iii), (iv), and (v) shall be net of Third Party Proceeds from
Purchaser Workers Compensation Policies. Purchaser expressly agrees to promptly
notify the applicable issuer of Workers Compensation Policies of any such claim
or loss and to tender defense, defense costs and/or indemnity to such insurance
carrier, as applicable. Purchaser agrees to pursue diligently recoveries under
insurance policies for such claims in cooperation with Sellers, and to
reasonably cooperate with each applicable insurance carrier. Sellers shall
reimburse Purchaser for out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees, including
outside attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by Purchaser after the Closing Date
in connection with pursuing coverage pursuant to this Section. Any commencement
of a Legal Proceeding against an issuer of a Purchaser Workers Compensation
Policy relating to claims under this Section 11.6 shall be subject to
Purchaser's consent, which consent may not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
Purchaser shall not withhold consent solely on the grounds that such an action
may impair insurance limits of Purchaser Workers Compensation Policies.
Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for any losses indemnified by Sellers which
are recovered by Purchaser from insurance carriers.



                                   ARTICLE XII

                         NONCOMPETITION; NONSOLICITATION

     Section 12.1. NONCOMPETITION.

     (a) Subject to SECTION 12.1(b), Vulcan covenants and agrees that for a
period of three (3) years following the Closing Date or, with respect to 5CP
only, following the 5CP Year ending on December 31, 2012 (as the case may be,
the "COVENANT TERM") it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to:

          (i) engage in the manufacture, marketing, production or sale of, or
     research and development with respect to, products that are within the
     scope of the Business (a "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS") in direct competition with
     Purchaser; or

          (ii) make use of, in connection with any Competitive Business, any
     mailing lists, customer lists, subscription lists, processes, trade
     secrets, software, research, techniques, designs or other technical data,
     know-how or other proprietary or confidential information in use or used by
     either Seller prior to or as of the Closing in connection with the Business
     or that constitutes a Purchased Asset.

     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in SECTION 12.1(a):

          (i) in the event that during the Covenant Term Vulcan completes a
     business combination transaction with a Person that is engaged in any
     Competitive Business, which transaction results in the holders of the
     voting securities of Vulcan outstanding immediately prior to the
     consummation of such transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power
     of the voting securities of Seller or the surviving entity in the
     transaction or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after the
     consummation of


                                      -57-

<PAGE>

such transaction, the provisions of SECTION 12.1(a) shall terminate and cease to
be of any further force or effect;

          (ii) Vulcan may directly or indirectly hold interests in or securities
     of any Person to the extent that such investment does not directly or
     indirectly confer on Vulcan more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power
     of such Person;

          (iii) Vulcan may complete a business combination transaction with a
     Person that is engaged in any Competitive Business if avoiding the
     restrictions set forth in SECTION 12.1(a) is not a purpose of such
     transaction, in which case such acquired business shall not be subject to
     SECTION 12.1(a) and may engage in any activity otherwise prohibited or
     restricted by SECTION 12.1(a); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such acquired
     business derived in excess of twenty five percent (25%) of its net income
     for the last completed fiscal year prior to such business combination from
     activities that constitute Competitive Businesses, Vulcan shall use
     reasonable efforts to divest that portion of such Person that engages in
     activities constituting Competitive Businesses on commercially reasonable
     terms as soon as reasonably practicable following the acquisition;

          (iv) Vulcan may produce, acquire or use any product for internal uses
     or to conduct Vulcan's or its Subsidiaries' other businesses that consume,
     use, contain, depend upon or otherwise incorporate any such product; and

          (v) Vulcan may perform any act or conduct any business contemplated by
     the Transition Services Agreement to be performed or conducted by Vulcan.

     (c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall be
deemed to require Vulcan to give notice to or obtain the consent of Purchaser in
order to engage in any transaction permitted under SECTION 12.1(b).

     Section 12.2. NONSOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Vulcan covenants and agrees
that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date it shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, solicit, directly or indirectly, any
Transferred Business Employee (at a time when such person is an employee of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries) to terminate his or her employment
relationship with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise to become
employed by Vulcan or its Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein
shall prohibit Vulcan or any of its Subsidiaries from (i) generalized
solicitations of potential employees by use of advertisements in the media that
are not targeted at Transferred Business Employees, (ii) incidental
solicitations by search firms that have not been encouraged or requested to
solicit Transferred Business Employees or (iii) hiring individuals not solicited
in contravention of this SECTION 12.2.

     Section 12.3. REMEDIES. Purchaser and Sellers each acknowledge that the
time, scope and other provisions of this ARTICLE XII have been specifically
negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree
that such time, scope and other provisions are reasonable under the
circumstances. It is further agreed that other remedies cannot fully compensate
Purchaser for a violation by Vulcan of the terms of this ARTICLE XII and that
Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such violation
or continuing


                                      -58-

<PAGE>

violation by Vulcan. It is the intent and understanding of each party hereto
that if, in any Legal Proceeding, any term, restriction, covenant or promise
herein is found to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such
term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 13.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned any time prior to the Closing:

     (a) upon the written agreement of Purchaser and Vulcan;

     (b) by Purchaser or Vulcan if the other party shall have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that is
reasonably likely to result in the failure of the conditions to Closing set
forth in SECTION 8.1 or 8.2, or SECTION 9.1 or 9.2, respectively, and such
breach has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after the giving of a
written notice by the terminating party to the other party of such breach;

     (c) by Purchaser or Vulcan on the earlier of (i) two hundred forty (240)
calendar days after the date hereof if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to such date and (ii) sixty (60) days after Purchaser makes any Offer to Consent
pursuant to Section 7.3(d) if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to such
date (PROVIDED, that in no event shall either party be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) prior to the date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date hereof); PROVIDED THAT the right to
terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 13.1(c) shall not be available to
any party hereto whose willful and material breach of this Agreement, as noticed
in writing by the non-terminating party, shall have been the proximate cause of
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date for so long as such
material breach remains uncured; PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT the right to terminate
this Agreement under this SECTION 13.1(c) shall not be available to any party
hereto if Vulcan is acting in good faith to effect the repair, rebuilding,
restoration or replacement addressed in SECTION 2.5 unless the required repair,
rebuilding, restoration or replacement has not been, or cannot reasonably be,
completed within the maximum time period set forth in SECTION 2.5(c); or

     (d) by Purchaser as provided in SECTION 2.5.

     Section 13.2. PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination by either party under SECTION 13.1(b) or (c), written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party and this Agreement shall terminate and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by
either party, upon delivery of such notice, except that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms and SECTIONS 13.2, 14.3,
14.4 and 14.6 shall also survive such termination. Notwithstanding any provision
hereof to the contrary, upon any termination hereof pursuant to SECTION 13.1, no
party hereto shall thereafter have any further liability or obligation
hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that subject to SECTION 11.1(d), no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for any willful
breach of any term hereof prior to the date of such termination.

Assets to be transferred to a third party in connection with actions to be taken
by Purchaser  pursuant to Section 7.3(c), and (2) after the Closing Date, in its

Purchaser and to such Pass-Through Purchaser's Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates,  their respective successors and permitted assigns and the officers,
directors,  employees and agents of each of the  foregoing;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that no  Pass-Through  Purchaser  shall have any rights  with  respect to Seller
greater   than  those  set  forth  in  any   purchase   agreement   (or  related
documentation) providing for the applicable acquisition of Purchased Properties;
and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no such assignment shall be deemed to (i) expand the
scope of the  liabilities  of Sellers  hereunder  or (ii) limit the scope of the
protections of Purchaser hereunder.

     Section  14.9.  BULK SALES  LAW.  Purchaser  hereby  waives  compliance  by
Sellers,  in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  with the
provisions of any applicable bulk sales law.

     Section 14.10. TAX-DEFERRED EXCHANGE. Purchaser may elect by written notice
to Sellers,  and Sellers may elect by written  notice to  Purchaser,  before the
Closing Date to effect a tax-deferred exchange under section 1031 of the Code of
all or part of the Purchased Assets, provided that such election does not impede
or delay the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and does not
alter the kind or amount of  consideration  received  by Sellers  hereunder.  If
either  party so elects,  the  notified  party shall use  reasonable  efforts to
cooperate with the other party and will execute escrow instructions,  documents,
agreements,  or  other  instruments,  as  reasonably  requested  to  effect  the
exchange. Purchaser or Sellers may assign their rights and delegate their duties
hereof to an exchange  intermediary  that it  selects,  as may be  necessary  to
effect a  tax-deferred  exchange.  Purchaser  shall  reimburse  Sellers  for all
out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  Sellers  as a result  of an  election  by
Purchaser under this SECTION 14.10.  Sellers shall  reimburse  Purchaser for all
out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  Purchaser  as a result of an  election by
Sellers under this SECTION 14.10.

     (a) This  Agreement  may be  amended,  supplemented  or  modified,  and any
provision  hereof may be waived,  only pursuant to a written  instrument  making
specific reference hereto signed by each of the parties hereto.

     (b)  Sellers may amend the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule to reflect
changes  that are  immaterial  to the  Business;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such
amendments may only be made if (x) Vulcan in good faith reasonably believes that
such  amendments  are  necessary  in  order  to  make  the  representations  and
warranties  true and correct in all  respects  on the Closing  Date and (y) such
amended Seller Disclosure  Schedule is submitted to Purchaser no less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 14.12. ENFORCEMENT.  The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event of any material breach hereof. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction  or  injunctions  to enforce
specifically  the terms and  provisions  hereof,  this being in  addition to any
other  remedy to which they are  entitled at law or in equity and not  otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 14.13.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of  counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an  original,  but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
