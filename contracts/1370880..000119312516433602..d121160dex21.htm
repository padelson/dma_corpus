iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of January 14, 2016 by and among FireEye, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Iris Merger Corporation, a Texas corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), iSIGHT Security, Inc., a Texas
corporation (the "Company"), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as stockholder
representative (the "Stockholder Representative"). All capitalized terms that
are used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
each corporation and their respective stockholders that Parent acquire the
Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
pursuant to which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and in
furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements (the
"Transactions").

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i)
each Key Employee listed on Schedule A is accepting an offer letter from
Parent (collectively, the "Key Employee Offer Letter") and (ii) each of the
Key Employees have executed a Non-Competition Agreement in substantially the
form set forth as Exhibit A (the "Non-Competition Agreement").

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each Stockholder listed on Schedule B (each, a "Major Stockholder") has
executed and delivered to Parent a Joinder Agreement in the form set forth in
Exhibit B (a "Joinder"), and an accredited investor questionnaire in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (an "Accredited Investor
Questionnaire").

 

WHEREAS, based on the Accredited Investor Questionnaires delivered prior to
the execution of this Agreement and other information made available to
Parent by the Company, Parent reasonably believes that no more than thirty-
five (35) of the recipients of Parent Common Stock in the Transactions are not
accredited investors (as such term is used in Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act) and that the issuance of all shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Transaction will validly qualify for an exemption from the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and
the equivalent state "blue-sky" Legal Requirements (the "Share Registration
Exemption").

WHEREAS, Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set forth
herein, in connection with the Transactions.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the

of Company Common Stock.

 

(b) _Company Capital Stock_.

in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(iii)) issued and outstanding as of

5  set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout this Agreement (subject to the

surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital
Stock and the execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal and a Joinder
Agreement in the manner provided in Section 1.7:

 

(A) with respect to each outstanding share of Company Series C Preferred
Stock: the Per Share Series C Preferred Liquidation Preference;

 

(B) with respect to each outstanding share of Company Series B Preferred
Stock: (1) the Per Share Series B Preferred Liquidation Preference, (2) the
Per Share Common Closing Merger Consideration, (3) the Per Share Common Escrow
Consideration, (4) the Per Share Representative Escrow Fund Consideration and
(5) the Per Share Common Earnout Consideration, if as and to the extent
earned;

(C) with respect to each outstanding share of Company Series A Preferred
Stock: (1) the Per Share Common Closing Merger Consideration, (2) the Per
Share Common Escrow Consideration, (3) the Per Share Representative Escrow
Fund Consideration and (4) the Per Share Common Earnout Consideration, if, as
and to the extent earned; and 

(D) with respect to each outstanding share of Company Common Stock: (1) the
Per Share Common Closing Merger Consideration, (2) the Per Share Common
Escrow Consideration, (3) the Per Share Representative Escrow Fund
Consideration and (4) the Per Share Common Earnout Consideration, if, as and
to the extent earned.

 

"Merger Consideration" shall mean all of the amounts payable pursuant to
Sections 1.6(b)(i)(A) through (D). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (A) a portion of the consideration that otherwise would be payable at
the Closing to each Stockholder pursuant to Sections 1.6(b)(i)(B) through (D)
shall be withheld at the Closing and (1) deposited into the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii) and (2) deposited into the Representative
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(iii), which will be distributed to the
Stockholders in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and, as applicable, the Escrow Agreement, (B) Parent shall pay
in cash in lieu of shares of Parent Common Stock any amounts payable from time
to time hereunder that would otherwise be paid in shares of Parent Common
Stock to any Stockholder that is not a Major Stockholder and (C) any such
amounts paid in cash that would otherwise have been paid in shares of Parent
Common Stock if not for the foregoing clause (B) shall be deducted on a pro
rata basis from the amount of cash consideration payable from time to time to
the Major Stockholders and paid instead in a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock of equivalent value to such deducted amounts with each share valued at
the Parent Trading Price. For purposes of calculating all amounts issuable to
each Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.6, all shares of Company Capital
Stock held by each Stockholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-
certificate basis, the amount of cash consideration due in respect of each
such certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock due in respect of each such
certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. No fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger,
_provided_ , that any Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount of cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) such
fraction _by_ (B) the Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.

 

(ii) _Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the
respective stockholders thereof, each share of Company Capital Stock that is
issued and outstanding and held by the Company or any Subsidiary as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Shares") shall be
cancelled without any consideration paid therefor.

 



6 (iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the holder
thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Texas Law,
and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights
under Texas Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration
for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i) but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Texas Law.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.6(b)(iii), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Texas Law, then, as
of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares,
upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout this Agreement
(including the indemnification and escrow provisions set forth in Article
VII), the consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section
1.6(b)(i) without interest thereon. After the Closing, Parent shall give the
Stockholder Representative (A) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) pursuant to the applicable provisions of Texas Law and
(B) the opportunity to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, nor the Stockholder Representative,
on the other hand, shall make any payment with respect to any such demands or
offer to settle or settle any such demands without the prior written consent
of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. After the
Closing, any communication to be made by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand, to any such demanding Stockholder with
respect to such demands shall be submitted to the other party in advance and
shall not be presented to any such demanding Stockholder prior to such Person
receiving the other partys written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

 

 __(c) _Earnout Payment._

 

(i) As additional Merger Consideration, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to the Stockholders (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the holders of
shares Company Series C Preferred Stock with respect to such shares), in
accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, the Earnout Amount, when, as and if
any such amount becomes payable pursuant to this Agreement, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth on Schedule 1.6(c)(i). Any portion of the
Earnout Amount payable pursuant to this Section 1.6(c) does not constitute
compensation for services, but rather constitutes part of the consideration
for the Company Capital Stock owned by the Stockholders.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Escrow
Fund has been exhausted or distributed, Parent shall be entitled to set off
any and all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Parties, to the extent (and
solely to the extent) such Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification therefor (subject, in each case, to the terms and limitations
set forth in Article VII), against any portion of the Earnout Amount otherwise
payable and not yet paid by Parent; _provided_ , that any such set off shall
be in the same ratio of cash to Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent
Trading Price) as the Earnout Amount.

(iii) Following the Closing Date, for so long as the Earnout Amount may
become payable hereunder, (A) Parent shall provide, within 20 days following
the public announcement by Parent of Parents selected financial results (but
not preliminary financial results) for any fiscal quarter 

 



7  that may be used to determine the achievement of the Earnout Target (or, if
the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parents ultimate parent entity are not
then publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the date that is 45
days following the completion of such quarter), a written report to the
Stockholder Representative setting forth in reasonable detail the Aggregate
Offering Bookings for such fiscal quarter and the Aggregate Offering Bookings
for the latest Measurement Period that included such fiscal quarter (each such
report, an "Update Report"); and (B) Parent shall notify the Stockholder
Representative whether the Earnout Target has been achieved. Within 20 days
after delivery of an Update Report, if the Stockholder Representative requests
(and subject to the Stockholder Representatives execution of a customary non-
disclosure agreement), Parent shall (1) make available for a meeting with the
Stockholder Representative at least one officer with substantial knowledge of
the activities of Parent related to the achievement of the Earnout Target to
discuss such report and (2) make such documents available for inspection as
may be reasonably necessary to allow the Stockholder Representative and its
representatives to validate the information provided in the Update Report.

 

(iv) Promptly, but no more than twenty (20) Business Day following the
determination of the successful achievement of the Earnout Target, Parent
shall transfer or issue, or cause to be transferred or issued, the Earnout
Amount to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the holders of shares Company Series
C Preferred Stock with respect to such shares) in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.6(b).

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall have sole
discretion over its operations following the Closing, including the right to
discontinue any of its products or service offerings (including after Closing,
the products or service offerings of the Surviving Corporation) at any time,
_provided, however,_ that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (as
determined from time to time after the Closing by mutual agreement between
Parents chief executive officer and the Founder;  _provided,_ that this
parenthetical shall apply only when (A) there has not been a Change of Control
of Parent or (B) there has been a Change of Control of Parent and the chief
executive officer of Parent on the date hereof is the chief executive officer
of the combined company (or any successor thereto) following such Change of
Control of Parent) to assist with the achievement of the Earnout Target. For
purposes of clarity, the termination or non-renewal of any contracts with any
Partners, and any failure to pursue or enter into any contracts with any
Partners, by Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries for a
legitimate business purpose (other than for the purpose of avoiding the
payment of the Earnout Amount) shall not be deemed to be a violation of
Parents obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the
achievement of the Earnout Target. In the event of a Change of Control of
Parent, the acquiring entity in such change of control may elect to
accelerate the payment of the Earnout Amount in full or permit the payment of
the Earnout Amount to continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. As used herein, a "Partner" means a customer, user, reseller,
distributor, OEM or other licensee that has the right, or that would like to
obtain the right, (X) to integrate any threat intelligence or other
Intellectual Property Rights of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries into such customers, users, resellers,
distributors, OEMs or other licensees own product or service offering (or
offerings) to third parties or (Y) to resell any threat intelligence or other
Intellectual Property Rights of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries.

(vi) If the Stockholder Representative in good faith believes that that the
information provided in an Update Report or Update Reports is not or was not
accurate, then the Stockholder Representative may provide Parent with written
notice (such notice, a "Earnout Dispute Notice") thereof and Parent shall
work together with the Stockholder Representative to schedule an in-person
meeting, if reasonably feasible, at a mutually acceptable location or will
schedule one or more conference calls to address the asserted inaccuracies,
and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall endeavor in good faith to
resolve any such dispute.

 



8 (vii) If the parties do not reach agreement resolving the dispute in
accordance with Section 1.6(c)(vi), then, within thirty (30) days after the
Stockholder Representatives delivery of an Earnout Dispute Notice, either the
Stockholder Representative or Parent, as the case may be, may submit such
dispute to Ernst and Young LLP, or if such firm cannot or does not accept such
engagement, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm,
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Stockholder Representative, which shall
not be the independent accountants of Parent (such firm, the "Accounting
Firm"). Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the
Accounting Firm (A) to determine the amount of Aggregate Offering Bookings for
each fiscal quarter set forth in the Earnout Dispute Notice(s) that remains
subject to dispute, (B) to determine, if applicable, whether the Earnout
Target has been achieved under the terms of this Agreement and (C) to make
such determination no later than the date that is 90 calendar days following
the selection of such Accounting Firm. The dispute shall be resolved by
submission of documents unless the Accounting Firm determines that an oral
hearing is necessary. The Accounting Firm shall, within the 10 Business Days
of appointment, determine what shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and
appropriate deadlines for submitting documents and dates, if any, of oral
hearings. The parties shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the
Accounting Firm for such documents or information as they may require in
support of their determination, and provide responses to all reasonable
questions or interrogatories in connection therewith. Each of Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Stockholders) shall
pay its own expenses of arbitration, and the fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall initially be equally shared between Parent and the
Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Stockholders); _provided_
that the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the prevailing party
in such dispute (as determined by the Accounting Firm), including its share of
the arbitration, its attorneys fees, costs and expenses, and the fees, costs
and expenses of the Accounting Firm, shall be reimbursed by the other party.
With respect to any Earnout Dispute Notice, any decision rendered by the
Accounting Firm with respect to Aggregate Offering Bookings and/or whether
the Earnout Target has been achieved prior to such Earnout Dispute Notice
shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder Representative
(including with respect to any Update Reports and Earnout Dispute Notices
thereafter). All proceedings conducted by the Selected Expert shall take
place in San Francisco, California.

_1.7 Payment of Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock._

(a) _Exchange Agent_. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC shall serve
as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger.

(b) _Parent Closing Payments_.

 

(i) On the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date)), Parent shall
transfer or issue, or cause to be transferred or issued, to the Exchange Agent
the amount of cash payable to the Stockholders at Closing pursuant to Section
1.6(b)(i) in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) On the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
no event later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date)),
Parent shall transfer or issue, or cause to be transferred or issued, the
Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to hold in trust as an escrow fund (the
"Escrow Fund") under the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Upon deposit of the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Parent shall be deemed to have contributed each
relevant Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow
Fund.

 



9 (iii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the Representative Expense
Amount to the Stockholder Representative to hold (the "Representative Escrow
Fund") under the terms of this Agreement. The Representative Escrow Fund will
be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the ancillary agreements. The Stockholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Representative Escrow Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Escrow Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Upon deposit of the Representative
Expense Amount with the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this
Section 1.7(b)(iii), for tax purposes Parent shall be deemed to have paid
each relevant Stockholder its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the
Representative Expense Amount and then each such Stockholder shall be deemed
to have voluntarily contributed such amount to the Representative Escrow Fund,
any withholding in respect thereof shall be satisfied from the Total Common
Closing Merger Consideration owing to the Stockholder on the Closing Date and,
for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Representative Escrow Fund that
is returned to the Stockholders shall not again be subject to information
reporting or withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, the holders of shares of
Company Series C Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have received any
portion of the Representative Escrow Fund relating to their ownership of
Company Series C Preferred Stock.

(c) _Payment Spreadsheet_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a payment spreadsheet (the "Payment Spreadsheet") setting forth:

(i) the amount and calculation of the Total Consideration and the Total
Common Closing Merger Consideration;

(ii) the amount and calculation of the Total Series B Preferred Liquidation
Preference and Total Series C Preferred Liquidation Preference;

(iii) the amount and calculation of the Per Share Series B Preferred
Liquidation Preference and the Per Share Series C Preferred Liquidation
Preference;

(iv) the amount and calculation of the Per Share Common Closing Merger
Consideration and the Per Share Common Earnout Consideration;

(v) the number of shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock;

(vi) the number of Total Outstanding Shares;

 

(vii) the amount of Indebtedness of the Company as of the close of business on
the Closing Date;

 

(viii) the amount of Third Party Expenses;

 

(ix) the Per Share Common Earnout Cash Consideration;

 

(x) the Per Share Common Earnout Stock Consideration;

 

(xi) the Per Share Common Escrow Consideration; and

 



10 (xii) with respect to each Stockholder: (A) the name and address of such
holder, (B) whether such holder is a current or former employee of the
Company (or any Subsidiary), (C) the number, class and series of shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such holder and the respective certificate
number, (D) the date of acquisition of such shares and, with respect to any
security that would be deemed a "covered security" under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6045-1(a)(15), the cost basis of such shares, (E) the cash
consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.6(b) and may be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(c) (on a
certificate-by-certificate basis and in the aggregate, net of the 2015
Corrective Withholding (as applicable)), (F) the stock consideration that
such holder may be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(c) (on a
certificate-by-certificate basis and in the aggregate), (G) the Pro Rata
Portion of such holder, (H) the amount of cash to be deposited into the
Escrow Fund and the amount of cash to be deposited in the Representative
Escrow Fund, in each case, on behalf of such holder pursuant to this
Agreement, and (I) the net cash amounts to be paid to such holder at Closing
after giving effect to the foregoing clause (H) (on a certificate-by-
certificate basis and in the aggregate), (J) the amount of any withholding due
on any payment (assuming, solely for purposes of preparing the Payment
Spreadsheet, that such Stockholder has delivered to the Exchange Agent the
appropriate Form W-8, Form W-9 or similar tax form indicating that no
withholding is required) and (K) such other information as required by the
Exchange Agent in the form of spreadsheet provided to the Company prior to
the date hereof.

(d) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall mail a letter of transmittal in the
form set forth in Exhibit D (a "Letter of Transmittal") and a Joinder
Agreement to the address set forth opposite each such Stockholders name on
the Payment Spreadsheet (except to the extent any of such documents have
previously been received by Parent prior to the Closing from such
Stockholder). Promptly (but in no event more than five Business Days)
following receipt by the Exchange Agent of a Letter of Transmittal, a Joinder
Agreement and any applicable tax forms that the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require in connection therewith (except to the extent any of such documents
have previously been received by Parent prior to the Closing from such
Stockholder) (the "Exchange Documents"), duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and a certificate representing
the relevant shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock
Certificates"), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the holder of
such Company Stock Certificate in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof at Closing pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) (less the
amount of cash withheld and deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
1.7(b)(ii) and less the amount of cash withheld and deposited in the
Representative Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(iii)) and the Company
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered,
each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be
deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to
receive the cash and stock amounts payable hereunder in exchange for shares of
Company Capital Stock (without interest). Subject to Section 1.7(e), no
portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares of Company
Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and
validly executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. For all purposes under
this Agreement the value attributable to a share of Parent Common Stock shall
be the Parent Trading Price.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or
Parent shall pay and/or issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Merger Consideration, if any, payable and/or issuable in
respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b) upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that as conditions
precedent to the issuance thereof the Stockholder who is the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate shall have provided an indemnification
agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent against any
claim that may be made against Parent,

 



11  the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and to the extent
required by the Exchange Agent, the Stockholder who is the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates shall have delivered a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct.

 

(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts or stock are to be disbursed
pursuant to Section 1.6 and this Section 1.7 to a Person other than the
Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof
that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(g) _Shares of Parent Common Stock_. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued
by Parent to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(b), and this Section
1.7 shall be placed in a restrictive class bearing the following restrictive
legend:

 

THE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT AND
ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION
UNDER SAID ACT. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS.

 

(h) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following the
last day of the sixth month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated
successor or assign all cash amounts that have been deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i), and any and all interest
thereon or other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and thereafter the
holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only
to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of Section
1.7(j)) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all cash
amounts and stock that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 1.7(d) upon the due surrender of such
Company Stock Certificates and duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner
set forth in Section 1.7(d). No interest shall be payable for the cash amounts
and stock delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section
1.7(h) and which are subsequently delivered to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates.

 

(i) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Following the
consummation of the Merger, the cash amounts and stock paid in respect of the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 



12 (j) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, or
any party hereto shall be liable to a Stockholder for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

(k) _Statement of Expenses_. Without limitation to any other provision of this
Agreement, in making any payment in respect of any Third Party Expenses at
the Closing and in calculating the Total Consideration, Parent shall be
entitled to rely on the spreadsheet attached as Annex C (the "Statement of
Expenses"), which statement sets forth the Companys statement of all paid
and unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, or anticipated to be incurred or payable by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing and wire
instructions for each payment to be made at Closing.

_1.8 Withholding Taxes_. The Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law or under any Legal Requirements or applicable Orders and shall be
permitted to pay or cause to be paid any amounts due under this Agreement
through an appropriate payroll service provider of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates in order to
facilitate any such deducting or withholding. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity
or other Person, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

 _1.9 Taking of Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, or to vest Parent with full right, title and possession to
all of the Company Capital Stock, then each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the officers and directors of each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF THE COMPANY

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the specific section,
subsection or sub-clause of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent on the date hereof prior to the execution and delivery hereof (the
"Disclosure Schedule") that corresponds to the specific section, subsection
or sub-clause of each representation and warranty set forth in this Article II
(provided, however, that any information set forth in a section, subsection
or sub-clause of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for
purposes of, and shall qualify, the corresponding section, subsection or sub-
clause of this Agreement and any other section, subsection or sub-clause of
this Agreement, where it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such information applies to such other Section or subsection),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger Sub as
follows:

 

 _2.1 Organization and Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Texas. The Company has the requisite corporate power to own, lease
and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as
currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of its assets or properties

 



13  (whether owned, leased or licensed) or the nature of its business make such
qualification or license necessary to the Companys business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. The Company has Made Available true, correct and complete
copies of its certificate of formation, as amended to date (the "Certificate
of Formation"), and bylaws, as amended to date, each in full force and effect
on the date hereof (collectively, the "Charter Documents"). When made, all the
payments made in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and as reflected in the
Payment Spreadsheet shall comply with the Charter Documents. Since the date of
the Charter Documents Made Available, the Company Board has not approved or
proposed any amendment to any of the Charter Documents. Section 2.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule lists the directors and board appointed officers of the
Company.

 

 _2.2 Authority and Enforceability._

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and, subject
to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company (including the unanimous approval of the Company
Board) and no further corporate or other action is required on the part of the
Company to authorize this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which the
Company is a party or to consummate the Transactions, other than the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders of the
Company who hold at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, voting
together as a single class on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis
(the "Requisite Stockholder Approval"). The Requisite Stockholder Approval is
the only vote of the Stockholders required under applicable Legal
Requirements, the Charter Documents and all Contracts to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party to legally adopt this Agreement and approve the
Transactions.

 

(b) The Company Board has unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its Stockholders, approved this Agreement and the Transactions,
and recommended to the Stockholders to vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Transactions. The Company Board has taken all
necessary actions so that any restrictions on business combinations under
applicable Legal Requirements are not applicable to this Agreement and the
Transactions and no "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or
other antitakeover Legal Requirement (such Law, "Takeover Law") applies to
this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) This Agreement and each of the Related Agreements to which the Company is
a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and
thereto, constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
(x) Legal Requirements of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, the relief of debtors and enforcement of creditors
rights in general, and (y) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief, other equitable remedies and other general principles of
equity (clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the "Enforceability Limitations").

_2.3 Governmental Approvals and Consents_. No consent, notice,
waiver, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with any Governmental Entity, is required by, or with respect to, the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or the consummation of the Merger, except for (a) such
consents, notices, waivers, approvals, orders,

 



14  authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under the HSR Act, (b) such consents, notices, waivers, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under applicable securities laws and state "blue sky" laws, and (c) the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Texas.

 

 _2.4 No Conflicts._ The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and any Related Agreement to which the Company is a party, and the
consummation of the Transactions, will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any material benefit under,
or result in the imposition of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any
material assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of the equity
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, (any such event, a
"Conflict") (a) any provision of the Charter Documents or the organizational
documents of any Subsidiary, as amended, (b) any Material Contract (other than
a Reseller Agreement that is not a Material Reseller Agreement) to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible) are bound, or (c) any
Legal Requirement or Order applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.

Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed (to the extent such concepts are
applicable) to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned,
leased or licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualifications or
licenses necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed

a whole. A true, correct and complete copy of each Subsidiarys charter
documents and bylaws (or similar charter documents), each as amended to date
and in full force and effect on the date hereof, has been Made Available. All

liability company, partnership, association, joint venture or other business

applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and consistent
with each other (except that the Interim Financials do not contain footnotes,
and may include adjustments relating to stock compensation, current versus
long term balance sheet reclasses and other presentation items that may be
required by GAAP). The Financials present fairly, in all material respects,
the Companys consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash
flows as of the dates and during the periods indicated therein, subject in
the case of the Interim Financials to normal year-end adjustments, which are
not material in amount or significance in any individual case or in the
aggregate. The Companys unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the

and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, (ii) provide assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and
the Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of management and the Company Board and (iii) provide assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries. Neither the

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or any
Subsidiary in the Companys consolidated financial statements.

this Agreement, (c) relating to the performance of the Material Contracts

(b) _Reserves for Payment of Taxes_. The Financials fully accrue all actual
and contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the
dates thereof in accordance with GAAP. The Company and each Subsidiary, as the
case may be, will establish, in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with its past practices, reserves adequate for the payment of all Taxes for
the period from the date of the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date,
and the Company will disclose the dollar amount of such reserves to Parent on

ordinary course of business. All payments of estimated Taxes have been made in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract
(other than a Contract, such as a lease, the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes). Section 2.10(g) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
persons who are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) as determined as of

lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right, and all amendments,
terminations and modifications thereof (collectively, the "Lease Agreements").
The Company and the Subsidiaries currently occupy all of the Leased Real
Property for the operation of its business. There are no other parties
occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders fees
with respect to any such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if
any existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company and each Subsidiary has
performed all of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant to
which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from any material structural, physical and
mechanical defects, is maintained in a manner consistent with standards
generally followed with respect to similar properties, and is structurally
sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the Companys business as
currently conducted. Neither the operation of the Company or any Subsidiary on
the Leased Real Property nor, to the Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such
Leased Real Property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not
dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

_2.12_   _Tangible Property_. The Company and each Subsidiary has good and
valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets,
real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and
clear of any Liens,

 



23  except for Permitted Liens. The material items of equipment owned or leased
by the Company or any Subsidiary (i) are adequate for the conduct of the
business of the Company and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted and (ii)
in good operating condition, regularly and properly maintained, subject to
normal wear and tear.

classification, tax withholding and reporting, social security contributions
withholding, prohibited discrimination, working time, employee representation,

Subsidiarys and their ERISA Affiliates current employees inside the United
States are terminable at the will of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, and

benefits, bonuses, commissions or amounts under other compensation plans,
that were previously earned, vested or accrued under Company Employee Plans
prior to the Effective Time). Section 2.16(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists

termination by the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of such Employees
employment or provision of services, other than those disclosed in Section

Company Authorizations are in full force and effect, and no suspension or
cancellation of any such Company Authorizations is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened. The Company Authorizations constitute
all Company Authorizations required to permit the Company and the
Subsidiaries to operate or conduct their respective businesses or hold any
interest in their respective properties or assets and none of the Company
Authorizations is subject to any term, provision, condition or limitation
which may adversely change or terminate such Company Authorizations by virtue
of the completion of the Merger. Since January 1, 2011, (i) the Company has
been and is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Company Authorizations, and (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has

policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed. In addition, there is no pending claim of which its total value
(inclusive of defense expenses) would reasonably be expected to exceed the

have been paid, (or if installment payments are due, will be paid if incurred
prior to the Closing Date) and the Company, any Subsidiary and its ERISA
Affiliates are otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such
policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing substantially

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed (i) in the specific section,
subsection or sub-clause of the disclosure schedule, if any, delivered by
Parent to the Company on the date hereof prior to the execution and delivery
hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") that corresponds to the specific
section, subsection or sub-clause of each representation and warranty set
forth in this Article III (provided, however, that any information set forth
in a section, subsection or sub-clause of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed for purposes of, and shall qualify, the corresponding
section, subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement and any other section,
subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement, where it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such information applies to such other
Section or subsection) or (ii) in the Parent SEC Documents (other than in any
"risk factor" disclosure or any other forward looking statements set forth
therein), each of Parent and the Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to
the Company as follows:

_3.1 Organization and Standing._ Parent is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. Merger Sub
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of Texas. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership of its properties makes such qualification necessary, except for
where such failures to be so qualified would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to delay or impair Parents or Merger Subs
abilities to consummate the Merger. Parent owns beneficially and of record all
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub free and clear of any Liens, and no
other Person holds any capital stock of Merger Sub nor has any rights to
acquire any interest in Merger Sub. Merger Sub was incorporated solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Merger Sub has engaged in no business activities or operations and has
conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

_3.2 Authority and Enforceability_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and any
Related Agreements to which it is a party and to consummate the Transactions.
The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other
action on the part of Parent and the Merger Sub. This Agreement and any
Related Agreements to which Parent and/or Merger Sub is a party have been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and constitute the valid
and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability
Limitations.

_3.3 Governmental Approvals and Consents_. No consent, waiver, approval, Order
or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or the Merger Sub
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
Related Agreements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or the
consummation of the Transactions, except for (a) such consents, waivers,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable securities laws and state "blue sky" laws,
in

 



43  (b) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the States of Texas, (c) such consents, notices, waivers, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under the HSR Act and (d) such consents, waivers, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings that have been
obtained prior to the execution of this Agreement on terms that in the
aggregate would not materially impair Parents ability to consummate the
Merger.

_3.4 No Conflicts._ The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions, will not result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any material benefit under
(a) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of Parent or Merger Sub, as amended or
(b) any Legal Requirement or Order applicable to Parent or any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries.

 

 _3.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements._

 

(a) A true and complete copy of each quarterly report and registration
statement filed by Parent with the SEC since the initial public offering of
Parent Common Stock on September 19, 2013 and prior to the date hereof (the
"Parent SEC Documents") is available on the Web site maintained by the SEC at
http://www.sec.gov, other than portions in respect of which confidential
treatment was granted by the SEC. As of their respective filing dates, the
Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained on their filing
dates any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Parent SEC
Document.

 

(b) Except as set forth in any Parent SEC Document, the financial statements
of Parent, including the notes thereto, included in the Parent SEC Documents
(the "Parent Financial Statements") complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect

GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, except in the case of

except as permitted under Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof

and recurring year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Parent; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Parent; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent that could have a
material effect on the Parent Financial Statements. Parent has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to provide
reasonable 

 



44  assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since
December 31, 2014, neither Parent nor Parents independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent; (B) any illegal
act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves Parent or its management
or other employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing. There are no outstanding loans made by Parent or any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7
under the Exchange Act) or director of Parent.

were issued and outstanding as of October 30, 2015 and 100,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the close of

in accordance with the terms hereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

 

(c) The Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent as part of the Merger
Consideration will be, when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

investment banker, broker, finder, agent or other Person that has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisors, brokerage, finders
or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement and the

execution of this Agreement, the Company will receive Stockholder Written
Consents from Stockholders pursuant to the preceding solicitation that are
sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Promptly upon obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall prepare and, as soon as reasonably practicable, send to all

consents, approvals and other documents required to be delivered hereunder and
to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any

as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of
the Transactions.

 

 _5.4 Access to Information_. The Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during the period from the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, Books and Records
and Contracts of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including all

and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the

Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as identified by Parent. The
Company agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
Representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax
Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify, amend or supplement
any representation or warranty set forth herein or in the Disclosure Schedule

or otherwise prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) payable in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing
and the Merger ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne and timely paid one-half by
Parent and one-half by the Stockholders. The Person(s) required by applicable
Legal Requirement to file any necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax Returns and documentation
and, if required by an applicable Legal Requirement, the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, shall join in the execution of such Tax Returns and
documentation.

 

 _5.6 [Reserved]._

 

 _5.7 Directors  and Officers Indemnification._

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successor to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company with respect to all
rights to indemnification (including advancement of expenses) or exculpation
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, any
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under the Charter Documents
or in any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof and set
forth in Section 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedule to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party"
and collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of the
Surviving Corporation for any specified period following the Effective Time.
The Company hereby represents to Parent that no claim for indemnification has
been made as of the date hereof by any director or officer of the Company.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase (and pay in full
all premiums on) an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
Companys directors and officers on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent that
shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years
following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not materially less favorable to the insured Persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company and any premiums with respect to such policy shall be Third Party
Expenses hereunder. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder; _provided, however_ , that Parent and
the

 



52  Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to pay premiums or any other
amounts with respect to such policy. In addition, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall purchase (which expense shall not be a Third Party Expense)
a single premium tail coverage policy with respect to the Companys current
errors and omissions insurance policies that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the " _Errors and Omissions
Insurance_ ") for a period of sixty (60) months following the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 5.7 applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7
and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(d) In the event that, following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the
benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that either the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

 

 _5.8 Tax Matters_. Neither Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent shall file,
amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in
part to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
which results in the Indemnifying Parties becoming liable for additional
Taxes, without consulting the Stockholder Representative and considering in
good faith the Stockholder Representatives reasonable comments. Parent and
any Affiliate of Parent shall prepare any such Tax Returns relating in whole
or in part to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period consistent with the past practices of the Company unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall have the right, in its sole discretion (so long as done in good faith),
to initiate voluntary disclosures with applicable Governmental Entities with
respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Prior to initiating any such voluntary disclosures or discussions,
and to the extent practicable, at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
such event, Parent shall provide a copy of any voluntary disclosure
application which reflects Taxes for which the Indemnifying Parties are liable
pursuant to this Agreement to the Stockholder Representative for the
Stockholder Representatives review and reasonable comment. Following delivery
to the Stockholder Representative of such copy of such application, Parent
shall, if requested by the Stockholder Representative, engage in good faith
discussions in respect thereof, and Parent shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments timely provided by the Stockholder Representative.

constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

and Section 1.2(b)(ii)(B) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach
or inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within ten
(10) calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; _provided,
however_ , that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or

Person shall remain liable for any willful and intentional breaches of this
Agreement, Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instruments
delivered pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that, the provisions of this Section 6.2, Sections 8.6

force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of this Article VI.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

 

 _7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Related Indemnification
Claims_. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California time on the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the date of expiration
of such period, the "Expiration Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that each
Specified Representation, and the right to make indemnification claims in
respect of such Specified Representation, shall survive until the expiration
of all applicable underlying statutes of limitations governing the subject
matters addressed by each such

 



54  Specified Representation (including all periods of extension, whether
automatic or permissive and without giving effect to the limitations of 10
Del. C. § 8106(a)); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that all representations and
warranties of the Company, and the right to make indemnification claims in
respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive beyond the Expiration Date
or other survival periods specified above with respect to any inaccuracy
therein or breach thereof if a claim is timely made in accordance with the
terms hereunder prior to the expiration of the survival period for such
representation and warranty, in which case such representation and
warranty, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been
finally resolved without giving effect to the limitations of 10 Del. C. §
8106(a), and; _provided further,_ that where any survival period that extends
beyond the Expiration Date would otherwise be limited by 10 Del. C. § 8106(a)
the parties intend that 10 Del. C. § 8106(c) shall apply. The representations
and warranties of Parent and the Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing
respective survival periods and termination dates supersede any applicable
statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to such representations and
warranties and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement.

_7.2 Indemnification._

 

(a) From and after the consummation of the Merger, subject to the terms and
limitations of this Article VII, the Stockholders (each, an "Indemnifying
Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall severally, but not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) and their respective directors, officers and other
employees, (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties"), from and against all losses, liabilities and damages of any kind or
nature, Taxes, awards, judgments penalties, fees, costs and expenses,
including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and consultants fees and
expenses and any such reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or settling any

collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation)
(regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party claims),
resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing, a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement, without giving effect to any update of or modification to the
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in the event of any such breach
or inaccuracy, for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss relating
thereto no effect will be given to any qualifications based on the word
"material" or similar phrases (including "Company Material Adverse Effect")
contained therein (it being agreed and understood however that such
qualifications will continue to apply, as applicable, to the determination of
whether a breach or inaccuracy of representation or warranty has occurred);

 

(ii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information required to be set forth in the
Payment Spreadsheet, including any failure to properly calculate any item
required to be contained therein or any inaccuracy in any information
underlying any such calculation;

 

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement which is required to be
performed prior to the Closing;

 



55 (iv) any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such
shares in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all out-
of-pocket attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and including
any such out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding in
respect of Dissenting Shares;

 

(v) (A) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary attributable to any taxable
period or portion thereof that ends on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Tax Period") (it being understood that, in the case of Taxes based
upon income, sales, proceeds, profits, receipts, wages, compensation or
similar items (including for the avoidance of doubt income includible
in gross income pursuant to Section 951 of the Code), the Taxes attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined on
the basis of a closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company attributable to such
Tax period shall equal the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period up to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the taxable period), (B) any Transaction
Payroll Taxes, (C) any Taxes as a result of the Company or any Subsidiary
being (or ceasing to be), on or prior to the Closing Date, (1) a member of an
affiliated or combined group pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6

successor by contract (other than a Contract, such as a lease, the primary
purpose of which is not related to Taxes or otherwise), which relate to an
event occurring on or before the Closing Date, (D) as a result of an express
obligation arising on or prior to Closing Date to indemnify or otherwise
assume or succeed to the Taxes of any other Person, or (E) the Stockholders
share of any Transfer Taxes as set forth in Section 5.5; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Parties shall not indemnify the Indemnified Parties
from and against: (1) any Taxes arising as a result of any election made by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) after
the Closing, (2) any Taxes arising as a result of any action taken by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of
the ordinary course of business, or (3) Parents share of any Transfer Taxes
as set forth in Section 5.5;

 

(vi) [Reserved]; and

(vii) any actual fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by or
on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Disclosure Schedules) or the
Transactions.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any
Loss claimed by and/or paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to the
indemnification provisions hereof.

 

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VII (other than a payment made pursuant to an
Excess Loss Payment Election) will be treated as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for
purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to Section
7.3(b)(iv), the indemnification rights set forth in this Article VII shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the
Effective Time for any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims
of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this Section 7.2(d) shall
not be deemed a waiver by any party of

 



56  any right to specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this
Article VII shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such
Indemnifying Party) in connection with a claim based on actual fraud, willful
breach or intentional misrepresentation committed by or with the actual
knowledge of such Indemnifying Party.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any party to a Related
Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related Agreement against the other
parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein or in any Related Agreement shall give rise to any right on
the part of any Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the
Transactions, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 _7.3 Limitations on Indemnification._

 

(a) _Threshold_. Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or
intentional misrepresentation, and for breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Specified Representations, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not
recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section
7.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall
have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $1,000,000 in Losses in
the aggregate in respect of indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a)(i)
(the "Threshold Amount"). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations
set forth in this Section 7.3(a)(i) shall not apply to indemnification claims
under any other clause of Section 7.2(a).

 

(b) _Maximum Liability_. __

 

(i) Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, and indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies
in the Specified Representations and the IP Representations, the Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for indemnification claims
under Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against the Escrow Amount held in
the Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.3(b)(i) shall not apply to any indemnification claim under clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) of Section 7.2(a).

(ii) Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, the liability of the Indemnifying Parties for
indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in the IP
Representations shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal
to $40,000,000 (net of any amounts distributed from the Escrow Fund to
the Indemnified Parties in satisfaction of such claims).

(iii) The Indemnified Parties first source of recovery for
indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the
Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Fund, but if the Escrow Fund is insufficient
to satisfy any portion of a Loss for which an indemnification claim has been
made under Section 7.2(a)(i) for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Specified
Representations or IP Representations, or for which an indemnification claim
has been made under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vii) of Section
7.2(a), the Indemnified Parties shall, subject in each case to the limitations
set forth in this Article VII, be entitled to recover such excess portion of
such Losses in respect of such indemnification claims (the portion of any
such excess Loss for which such indemnification is not satisfied by the Escrow
Fund is referred to as an "Excess Loss") directly from the Indemnifying
Parties and each Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VII, be liable, severally and not jointly, solely for
its, his or her pro rata portion, calculated based on the aggregate amount of
the sum of (A) the Total Consideration actually received and (B) Earnout
Amount actually received by such Indemnifying Party hereunder, of the Excess
Losses in respect of such indemnification claim; _provided_ , that each
Indemnifying Party may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to
satisfy such pro rata portion of any such Excess Losses in cash, in shares of
Parent Common Stock (valued at the then fair market value of such shares
rather than the Parent Trading Price) or a combination of the foregoing (such
election, an "Excess Loss Payment Election").

 



57 (iv) The liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims under
this Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal
to the sum of (A) the portion of the Total Consideration and (B) the portion
of the Earnout Amount, in each case, actually received by such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any withholding
applicable to such payments); _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
Article VII shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party in connection
with a claim based on actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of such
Indemnifying Party.

(c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any
other remedy based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. Other than with respect to any claim for fraud, no Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

 

(d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received by the Indemnified Parties in respect of such Losses or any of the
events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Losses (net
of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance,
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums resulting from any insurance recovery), _provided_ , that
nothing in this Section 7.3(d) shall be construed as or give rise to an
obligation to seek any such insurance, indemnification, contribution or
reimbursement. In the event that any insurance or other recovery is made by
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent with respect to any Losses for which Parent
or any such Affiliate has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the net aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the
Indemnifying Parties (on a pro rata basis based on the portion of the Loss
paid by or on behalf of each Indemnifying Party in respect of which such
recovery is made).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Indemnified
Party for any exemplary or punitive damages, or any damages measures by a
multiple of earnings, incurred, suffered or sustained by an Indemnified Party
except to the extent such exemplary or punitive damages are paid to a third
party.

(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Losses relating to any
matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has recovered Losses in respect of the same such matter
under another provision of this Agreement.

 



58 _7.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures._

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent)
(or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue such indemnification
claim directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party
directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered
or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or
sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of such Losses, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of
the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time
to reflect any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth
in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Following the delivery of an
Indemnification Claim Notice, Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives and agents with such documents and
records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as they may
reasonably require, and reasonable access to such personnel or representatives
of the Surviving Corporation (including but not limited to the individuals
responsible for the matters that are subject of the Indemnification Claim
Notice) as they may reasonably require, for the purposes of investigating or
resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in the
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person (other than a
party to this Agreement) of any Action with respect to which the Indemnifying
Parties may become obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VII (each, a "Third Party Action"), the Stockholder
Representative shall (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) have the right
to participate in (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties), but not to
determine, control or conduct, the defense of such third party Action. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative has affirmatively consented in
writing to the settlement of a Third Party Action, the Indemnifying Parties
shall have no power or authority to object to the recovery by Parent of the
amount of such settlement pursuant to this Article VII. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative does not consent to any such settlement, and the
Indemnified Parties wish to seek indemnification hereunder in respect of such
Third Party Action, then the Indemnified Parties shall make such
indemnification claims pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article
VII. A partys settlement of a Third Party Action without the consent of the
Stockholder Representative shall not be used as evidence of the truth of the
allegations in any Third Party Action or the merits of such Third Party
Action and the existence of any Third Party Action shall not create a
presumption of any breach by a party to this Agreement of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
shall not object in writing within the forty-five (45) day period after
receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of
objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim
(an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses
set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event and subject to
Section 7.4(i), the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund
an amount of cash equal to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim
Notice.

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c)
within forty-five (45) days after delivery of such Indemnification Claim
Notice, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If
the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties
and, in the case of an

 



59  indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to
Section 7.4(i), promptly release from the Escrow Fund the amount of cash set
forth in such memorandum. Should the amount held in the Escrow Fund, if any,
be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an Indemnified Party in
accordance with such memorandum and this Agreement (including the limitations
set forth in this Article VII), then each Indemnifying Party shall, within 10
Business Days following the date of such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified
Party such Indemnifying Partys pro rata portion of such shortfall as though
such shortfall was an Excess Loss.

 

(e) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to forty-five (45) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration
of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject of
a pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not
be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and
the Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days
after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one independent arbitrator. The
two arbitrators so selected shall select a third independent arbitrator.

 

(f) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS").
The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS. The arbitrator or
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator
or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover
relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have
the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the
same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that
discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was
refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the
arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to
the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification Claim Notice
shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and
the Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree
or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by Parent to the Indemnifying Parties or by
the Indemnifying Parties to Parent, such person(s) shall make the payment to
such other person(s), including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as
applicable. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision
shall apply to any dispute among the Indemnifying Parties or any Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Parties under this Article VII, whether relating to
claims to recover funds from the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification
obligations set forth in this Article VII.

 



60 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time from time to
time that any amounts shall be required to be disbursed from the Escrow Fund,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly and in any event
within five (5) Business Days deliver to the Escrow Agent a memorandum setting
forth such amounts, which shall be prepared and signed by both parties and
shall set forth the amount of cash to be disbursed from the Escrow Fund with
appropriate wiring and disbursement instructions with respect thereto. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. In
such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund the
amount of cash set forth in such memorandum.

 

(h) On the second Business Day following the Expiration Date, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to (i) retain an
amount, if any, equal to the amount of any claims for indemnification asserted
in good faith in an Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in accordance with
Section 7.4 prior to the termination of the Expiration Period but which are
not yet resolved (each such claim, an "Unresolved Claim") and (ii) release any
remaining Escrow Amount net of such Unresolved Claims to the Exchange Agent
for further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with Section
1.6(b). The amount of the Escrow Amount retained for each Unresolved Claim
shall be released (to the extent such funds are not utilized to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for such Unresolved Claim in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement) by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the prior sentence up on the resolution of such Unresolved Claim in
accordance with this Article VII.

 

 _7.5 Stockholder Representative._

 

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement and/or a
Stockholder Written Consent, and the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger by the Stockholders, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be
deemed to have agreed to appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as
its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and receive notices and
communications in respect of indemnification claims under this Agreement, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified
Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification
claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to, any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified
Party hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying
Party against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified
Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated or permitted
by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the
Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of
the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a resignation of the
Stockholder Representative or other vacancy in the position of
Stockholder Representative, such vacancy may be filled by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and
without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties shall
indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties,

 



61  fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative and any
amounts required to be paid by the Stockholder Representative to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement ("Stockholder Representative
Expenses"), in each case, as such Stockholder Representative Expense is
incurred or suffered; provided, that in the event that any such Stockholder
Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying
Parties the amount of such indemnified Stockholder Representative Expense to
the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Indemnifying
Parties, any such Stockholder Representative Expenses may be recovered by the
Stockholder Representative from (i) the Representative Expense Amount, (ii)
the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties, and (iii) from the
Earnout Amount at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties. The Representative Expense Amount
shall be available to pay directly, or reimburse the Stockholder
Representative for, any Stockholder Representative Expenses. Following the
Expiration Date, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
recover Stockholder Representative Expenses not previously recovered from the
Representative Escrow Fund from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to
the Indemnifying Parties (provided that such funds would otherwise be
released to the Indemnifying Parties and are no longer subject to any pending
indemnification claims), and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Stockholder Representative
Expenses actually incurred and not previously recovered. For the avoidance of
doubt, while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid
from the Representative Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund, this Section 7.5(b)
shall not limit the obligation of any Indemnifying Party to promptly pay such
Stockholder Representative Expenses as they are incurred, nor does it prevent
the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise.
The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities
in this Section 7.5(b) will survive the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement
(notwithstanding Section 6.2). Following the Expiration Date, the resolution
of all indemnification claims made under this Agreement and the satisfaction
of all such indemnification claims, the Stockholder Representative shall
distribute such portion of the Representative Expense Amount that has not been
used to reimburse the Stockholder Representative for Stockholder
Representative Expenses, if any, to the Escrow Agent, who will promptly
distribute such funds to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, shall constitute a
decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from
any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 

(c) Notwithstanding that the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
represented by Cooley LLP (the "Firm") in the preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the Related Agreements (collectively, the
"Transaction Agreements"), each of Parent and the Company agrees that after
the Closing the Firm may represent the Stockholder Representative, the
Indemnifying Parties and/or their Affiliates in all matters related to the
Transaction Agreements, including without limitation in respect of any
indemnification claims pursuant to the Transaction Agreements. Each of Parent
and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained information
relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the reasonably
foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it hereby waives
any conflict arising out of such future representation.

 



62 (d) Each of Parent and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that the Firm has represented the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. Such parties agree that any attorney-client privilege
and attorney work-product protection belonging to the Company and related to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and all
information and documents to the extent covered by such privilege or
protection shall, after the Closing, belong to, be deemed the right of, and
be controlled solely by the Indemnifying Parties and may only be waived by
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties. To the
extent that Parent or the Company receives or takes physical possession of any
privileged or protected material covered by this Section 7.5(d) after the
Closing, such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed
a waiver by the Indemnifying Parties of the privileges or protections
described in this Section 7.5.

ARTICLE VIII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

 _8.1 Certain Interpretations._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Annex, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Annex, Schedule
or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to
an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." All references
in this Agreement to "$" or dollars shall mean U.S. denominated dollars. The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. The Company
shall be responsible for compliance with this Agreement by its officers,
directors, employees and other agents (in their capacities as such). No
prior draft of this Agreement, any Related Agreement nor any course of
performance or course of dealing shall be used in the interpretation or
construction of this Agreement. No parole evidence shall be introduced in the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement unless the ambiguity or
uncertainty in issue is plainly discernible from a reading of this Agreement
without consideration of any extrinsic evidence. Although the same or similar
subject matters may be addressed in different provisions of this Agreement,
the parties intend that, except as reasonably apparent on the face of the
Agreement or as expressly provided in this Agreement, each such provision
shall be read separately, be given independent significance and not
be construed as limiting any other provision of this Agreement (whether or
not more general or more specific in scope, substance or content).

 

 _8.2 Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company) at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party against
whom enforcement is sought, _provided_ , that no amendment to be effected
after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval and which requires
stockholder approval under applicable Legal Requirements shall be effective
until the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval with respect to such
amendment. For purposes of this Section 8.2, subject to the proviso in the
prior sentence, the Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any amendment
of this Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding
upon and effective against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed
such amendment.

 



63 _8.3 Waiver._ At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent permitted under any
applicable Legal Requirements, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party set forth herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party set
forth herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of this Section 8.3, the
Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any extension or waiver signed by
the Company shall be binding upon and effective against all Stockholders
whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver.

 

 _8.4 Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately
liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder.

 

 _8.5 Notices._ All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial
messenger or courier service, or mailed by registered or certified mail

 _8.6 Confidentiality._ Each of the parties hereto (other than the
Stockholder Representative) hereby agrees that the information obtained in
any investigation pursuant to Section 5.4, or otherwise pursuant to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the
Transactions, shall be governed by the terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement effective as of October 11, 2013, as amended (the "Confidential
Disclosure Agreement"), between the Company and Parent. In this regard, the
Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and that
certain information obtained during the course of its due diligence could be
considered to be material non-public information within the meaning of federal
and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and
agrees not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or transactions in
the Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable securities laws. The
Stockholder Representative acknowledges and agrees that it will continue to be
bound by the terms and conditions of that certain Nondisclosure Agreement,
dated as of December 1, 2015, by and between the Stockholder Representative
and the Company, which is intended to cover all information disclosed to the
Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement and the
effectuation of the Transactions and which shall survive the Closing.

_8.7 Public Disclosure_ _._ Except as required by Legal Requirements and
other than with respect to information that is publicly disclosed, or approved
for public disclosure, by Parent, neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives shall issue any statement or communication to any third party
(other than its agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions)
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the Transactions, including,
if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor,
without the consent of Parent.

_8.8 Third Party Expenses._ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each party shall be responsible for its own expenses and costs that it incurs
with respect to the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements; _provided, however, _ that all Third
Party Expenses that are incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
deducted from the Total Consideration payable hereunder in respect of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the
adjustments contemplated by the definition of Total Consideration _._

_8.9 Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



65 _8.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Nothing in this Agreement, except
for Section 5.7, is intended to, or shall be construed to, confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 _8.11 Specific Performance and Other Remedies._

 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Stockholder or
the Stockholder Representative of any covenant, obligation or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled, without any
proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it), to a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or
other agreement and an injunction preventing or restraining such breach or
threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide or
post any bond or other security or collateral in connection with any such
decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or legal
proceeding.

 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall, subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in Article VII
(including Section 7.2(d)), be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive
of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party,
and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set
forth in Article VII, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement
of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in equity based on
any other Persons fraudulent acts or omissions or intentional
misrepresentation, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit
(i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for actual
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (ii) the time period during which a
claim for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation may be brought or
(iii) the recourse which any such party may seek against another Person with
respect to a claim for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

_8.12 Severability._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

_8.13 Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof, _provided, however,_ that the Merger shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with Texas Law.

_8.14 Exclusive Jurisdiction._ Subject to Sections 7.4(e) and 7.4(f), each
of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the state courts of the State of Delaware in connection with any
matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement and the Transactions or
any other matters contemplated herein (or, only if the state courts of the
State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware). Subject to Sections 7.4(e) and
7.4(f), each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto
