Step Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the First-Step Surviving Company.

 

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-, Holdings-, Merger Sub LLC- and
Merger Sub-Owned Stock. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by

cancelled (the "Cancelled Shares") and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.1(e), Section
2.5, Section 2.6, Section 2.7(f) and Section 2.8, each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock but excluding the
Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement,
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following,
without interest:

 

(i) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive cash (a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and not revoked
or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.6 (collectively, the "Cash Election
Shares"), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration (the
"Cash Consideration");

 

(ii) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive Parent Common Stock (a "Stock Election") has been effectively made
and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.6 (collectively, the
"Stock Election Shares"), a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the
"Stock Consideration");

 

(iii) For each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.6 (collectively, the "Non-Election
Shares"), the right to receive such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration
as is determined in accordance with Section 2.5. The Exchange Ratio shall be
determined using the closing sale price, rounded to the nearest one
tenthousandth, of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by The Wall
Street Journal for the last Business Day preceding the date of this Agreement.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article II, if Parent
shall make an Alternative Funding Election and the Closing occurs during the
Alternative Funding Election Period in accordance with Section 2.1(e), then
for each share of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the Per
Share Cash Consideration;

(v) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

(1) The "Exchange Ratio" means 2.5011; provided, however, that in lieu of the
issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from the
application of the Exchange Ratio, the holder of shares of Company Common
Stock shall have the right to receive cash in the manner described, and
pursuant to, Section 2.9 herein.

 

(2) The "Per Share Cash Consideration" means $110.00.

 

(3) The "Merger Consideration" means the Cash Consideration and/or, if

(vi) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article II shall no longer be issued or outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by
certificates ("Book-Entry Shares") and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)
the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and
subject to, this Section 2.1(c), Section 2.5 and Section 2.6 and (ii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.7(c) in each case of clause (i) and (ii), to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate
in accordance with Section 2.7(b) without interest (subject to all applicable
withholding of Tax in accordance with Section 2.7(h) below).

 

(d) Adjustment to Per Share Price and Exchange Ratio. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionally to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, stock dividend (including

Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time so as to provide the holders of Company Common Stock with the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event and
as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration.

 

(e) Alternative Funding Election.

 

(i) In the event that, prior to Closing, (A) all conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VI have been satisfied (other than (x) those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, and (y) the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(c) and/or the condition set forth in Section 6.3(d), as
applicable), and (B) the Company sends a written notice to Parent that (1) the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(c) is not satisfied and is not capable of
being satisfied (a "Parent MAE Notice"), and/or (2) the condition set forth in

Notice"), then, in each case, within five (5) Business Days following such
written notice, Parent may elect in a written notice sent to the Company (the
"Alternative Funding Election Notice"), at Parent's sole option and in its
sole discretion, to pay the Merger Consideration solely in cash and not in
Parent Common Stock (an "Alternative Funding Election"), in which event each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (including Restricted
Stock but excluding the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted automatically, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Agreement, into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash

shall set forth the sources of funds and reasonable evidence of the expected
availability of such funds (whether from cash on hand or other financing
sources) totaling an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration and
the

Loan Payoff Amount required to be paid pursuant to the Alternative Funding
Election; provided, further, that such Alternative Funding Election shall be
effective only if the parties hereto effect the Closing within twenty (20)
Business Days following the date the Alternative Funding Election Notice is
received by the Company (the "Alternative Funding Election Period").

 

(ii) If an effective Alternative Funding Election has been made, then without
any further required action by any of the parties hereto, the conditions to
Closing set forth in (A) Section 6.3(c), in the event a Parent MAE Notice has
been made, and (B) Section 6.1(d), Section 6.1(e), Section 6.2(d) and Section
6.3(d), in the event a Parent MAE Notice or a Company Tax Opinion Notice has
been made, shall be waived and have no further legal force or effect during
(and only during) the Alternative Funding Election Period. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Closing does not occur within the Alternative Funding
Election Period, (x) none of the conditions set forth in Article VI (including
Section 6.1(d), Section 6.1(e), Section 6.2(d), Section 6.3(c), and Section
6.3(d)) shall be deemed to be waived and (y) Parent may not thereafter make
another Alternative Funding Election.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Parent makes the Alternative Funding Election and the Closing occurs
during the Alternative Funding Election Period, any references in this
Agreement to (i) the Integrated Mergers as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) Parent, Holdings and the Company
as parties to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code or (iii) this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of

Section 2.2 Effect of Second-Step Merger. At the Second-Step Effective Time,
(a) the sole limited liability company interest of Merger Sub LLC issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second-Step Effective Time shall
thereafter remain outstanding as the sole limited liability company interest
of the Surviving Company and (b) the share of capital stock of the Company, as
the First-Step Surviving Company, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
such time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger
Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Option, whether or not
vested, shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the following:
(i) a cash payment equal to the excess of (A) the product of (1) 50% of the
Per Share Cash Consideration and (2) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Option over (B) the aggregate exercise price of
such Option and (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (A) 50% of the Exchange Ratio and (B) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Option; provided, however, that if Parent

Closing occurs during the Alternative Funding Election Period, each
outstanding Option, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled in exchange for
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the excess of (x) the product of
(I) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (II) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Option over (y) the aggregate exercise
price of such Option.

 

(b) Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time the vesting
conditions or restrictions applicable to each outstanding award of Restricted
Stock shall lapse. Each holder of a Restricted Stock award shall be entitled
to make the election described in Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.6 with respect
to the shares of Restricted Stock and to receive the consideration set forth
in Section 2.1, subject to Section 2.5; provided, however, that if Parent
makes the Alternative Funding Election pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the

Restricted Stock shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration with respect to each share of Restricted Stock.

 

(c) Performance Units. Each holder of a Performance Unit shall be entitled to
elect to receive (the "Payment Election"), in full settlement of such

full trading day prior to the Closing Date and (B) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Performance Unit or (ii) a combination
of (1) a cash payment equal to the product of (A) 50% of the Per Share Cash
Consideration and (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Performance Unit and (2) a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) 50% of the Exchange Ratio and (B) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Performance Unit;
provided, however, that if Parent makes the Alternative Funding Election
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the Closing occurs during the Alternative
Funding Election Period, each holder of a Performance Unit shall be entitled
to receive, in full settlement of such Performance Units, a cash payment equal
to the product of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (y) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Performance Unit. At
the Effective Time, each Performance Unit shall be cancelled (and the
agreement pursuant to which such Performance Unit was granted shall
terminate), the vesting conditions or restrictions applicable to each
outstanding Performance Unit shall lapse, and each holder thereof shall
receive payment for such Performance Units in accordance with his or her
Payment Election or pursuant to the proviso in the preceding sentence, as
applicable; provided that the number of Performance Units in respect of the
performance period as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be determined based on the level of achievement of such performance condition
through the last completed fiscal month prior to the Effective Time in a
manner that is consistent with past practice and pro-rated for the period
through the Effective Time.

 

(d) Payment. All payments under this Section 2.3 with respect to each Option,

following the Effective Time), less all applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(e) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take all actions that are
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3. In
addition, the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock
or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of the Options, the awards of Restricted Stock or the Performance
Units.

 

Section 2.4 Rights Plan. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all issued
and outstanding preferred share purchase rights of the Company issued pursuant
to the Rights Plan will expire in their entirety without any payment being
made in respect thereof.

 

Section 2.5 Proration.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) to be
entitled to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall be
equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (i) 0.50 and
(ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Restricted Stock but
excluding the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (the "Cash Conversion
Number"). All other shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted
Stock, but excluding the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than two (2) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall effect the allocation among holders of Company
Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

 

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (including
Restricted Stock) with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made
(the "Cash Election Number") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all
Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the

 

 

 

7  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which
is the Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

 

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Cash Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and
the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the
following manner:

 

(1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

 

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
Section 2.5 shall not apply in the event that, pursuant to Section 2.1(e), (A)
Parent makes an Alternative Funding Election and (B) the Closing occurs during
the Alternative Funding Election Period.

 

Section 2.6 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock (including Restricted Stock but excluding holders of Dissenting
Shares and Cancelled Shares) to be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and
subject to, Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.5 (a "Holder") shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to
submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.6 (herein called an "Election") the whole number
of shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) owned by such
Holder with respect to which such Holder desires (i) to make a Stock Election,
(ii) to make a Cash Election or (iii) to make no election with respect to the
receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration. For the
avoidance of doubt, shares with respect to which no election is made shall be
deemed Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely
made.

 

(b) Unless the properly completed Form of Election provides otherwise, for all
purposes of this Section 2.6 and in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), (i) a Holder will be treated as having surrendered,
in exchange for the total Cash Consideration, if any, to be paid to such
Holder under Article I (with respect to a Holder, the "Cash Portion"), the
number of shares of Company Common Stock of such Holder as to which such
Holder has a right to receive Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
and Section 2.5; and (ii) for purposes of clause (i), the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered by a Holder in exchange for such Holder's Cash
Portion will be deemed to be: (A) first, of those Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares evidencing shares held by

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

such Holder for more than one year before the Merger within the meaning of
Section 1223 of the Code, if any, those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, with the highest federal income tax basis, in descending order
until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, are exhausted or
the Cash Portion for such Holder is fully paid, then (B) of all other of such
Holder's Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, those Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares with the highest federal income tax basis, in descending order until
the Cash Portion for such Holder is fully paid.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Form of
Election"), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

 

(d) Parent shall, and, as applicable, shall cause the Paying Agent to, (i)
initially make available and mail the Form of Election to Holders not less
than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline, and
(ii) following such initial mailing, make available as promptly as possible a
Form of Election to any Holder who requests such Form of Election prior to the
Election Deadline. Parent shall provide to the Paying Agent all information
necessary for it to perform as specified herein. The time period between such
mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the "Election
Period."

 

(e) Any Election shall have been made properly only if Parent or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form
of Election properly completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal
materials included in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates representing all shares to which such Form of Election
relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Book-
Entry Shares or Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a
member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States; provided that such Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Paying Agent by the time required in
such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver physical certificates
representing shares covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time
set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its
reasonable discretion. For Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall establish Election
procedures for such Shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company.

 

(f) As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties,
"Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the date which the
parties hereto shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) Business Days
preceding the Closing Date. The parties hereto shall cooperate to issue a
press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them and subject to Section
5.14, announcing the anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than
fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior
to, the Effective Time. If the Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date,
the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and the
parties shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline.

 

(g) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to Parent prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. If
any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock or Restricted Stock (none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, Merger Sub
LLC nor the Company being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such
defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of
Company Common Stock or Restricted Stock covered by such Election shall, for
purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election
is thereafter timely made.

 

(h) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by Parent or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, or of the
guarantee of delivery of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, previously
deposited with Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable. All Elections shall
be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Paying Agent of written
notification from the parties hereto that this Agreement has been properly
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Form of Election and the
Paying Agent Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith
discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of
Election and compliance by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth
herein, (ii) subject to Section 2.7, the issuance and delivery of shares of
Parent Common Stock in which Shares are converted in the First-Step Merger and
(iii) subject to Section 2.9, the method of payment of cash for Shares
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding any Election
made by any Holder, each Holder shall be deemed to have made a Cash Election,
and any Stock Election shall, without the requirement of any further action by
Parent or the Holder, be deemed converted into a Cash Election, if, and only
if, pursuant to Section 2.1(e), (A) Parent shall make an Alternative Funding
Election and (B) the Closing occurs during the Alternative Funding Election
Period.

 

Section 2.7 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying and
exchange agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) to receive the Merger Consideration
to which holders of such shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to this Agreement and enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable
to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to the services to be performed
by the Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent Agreement"). Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause
Merger Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common
Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock, at Parent's election) equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.3 (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration) and
(ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay (w)
the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration pursuant to Section 2.9, (x) the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (y) the amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3 and, if applicable, (z) the aggregate Per Share Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(e) (such shares and cash amounts in
clauses (i) and (ii), as applicable (together with the dividends and
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.7(c)), the "Aggregate
Merger Consideration" or the "Payment Fund"). The cash portion of the Payment
Fund may, as determined by Parent, pending its disbursement pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, be invested by the Paying Agent in (I) short-
term direct obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or (II) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
full payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other income from
such investments shall become part of the Payment Fund; provided that any
amount in the Payment Fund in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
payable hereunder shall be disbursed to the Surviving Company upon the
termination of the Payment Fund pursuant to and in accordance with Section
2.7(f). No investment by the Paying Agent of the Payment Fund shall relieve
Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC, the First-Step Surviving Company, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent from making the payments to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares required by this Article II, and Parent
shall promptly replace any portion of the Payment Fund lost through any
investment made pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) at the
Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. No investment by the Paying Agent of
the Payment Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, (and in any event
no later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
(including Restricted Stock) immediately prior to the Effective Time that
thereafter was converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration and that has not theretofore submitted its
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with a Form of Election (i) a letter of
transmittal (which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock

represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and shall
be prepared prior to Closing) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request), together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.7(h), for each share of
Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) surrendered (and any
Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled) (I) the Stock
Consideration to which such holder of Company Common Stock (including
Restricted Stock) shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with,
and subject to, Section 2.1(c), Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, and/or (II) a
check or wire transfer representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration
to which such holder of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock)
shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to,
Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e), Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, (B) any dividends
or distributions which the holder of Company Common Stock (including
Restricted Stock) shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with
Section 2.7(c) and (C) a check or wire transfer representing the Fractional
Share Consideration, without interest, resulting from the rounding-down of any
shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to (I) above. If
payment of any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is registered in the transfer or stock
records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Person
requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer and (B) the
Person requesting such payment shall evidence payment of any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.7, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration for each applicable share of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

 

(c) Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions paid with respect to
such shares of the Stock Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by Parent to the Paying Agent and
shall be included in the Payment Fund, in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) there shall be paid to the holder entitled to Stock Consideration
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender,
previously paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder entitled to Stock Consideration is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time, the
stock

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the First-Step Surviving Company or the Surviving Company of
the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration (together with any
dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.7(c)), except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged pursuant to and in accordance with this
Article II.

 

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
deliverable in respect thereof to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

 

(f) Termination of Payment Fund. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest or other income received with respect thereto) that
had been made available to the Paying Agent and which remains unclaimed by, or
otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with this Article II, and thereafter Persons entitled to receive
payment pursuant to this Article II shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock
held by such holders, pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders
as of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC, the First-Step
Surviving Company, the Surviving Company, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official or a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) Withholding Taxes. Parent, Holdings, the First-Step Surviving Company, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Laws related to Taxes. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 2.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(c), to the extent
that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and

 

 

 

12  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

 

 

perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right
to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (prior to the Election Date), such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. If such holder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after
the Effective Time (or after the Election Deadline), each share of Company
Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as a Non-Election Share. Any
payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be
made by Parent (and not the Company, Holdings, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC),
and the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a
stockholder on the Closing Date. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will comply
with any notice requirements applicable to a merger without a meeting of
stockholders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

Section 2.9 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, upon surrender
of the applicable Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall pay each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the
nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (though subject to Section 2.5) and Section
2.3, by (ii) the closing sale price, rounded to the nearest one tenthousandth,
of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal for
the last Business Day preceding the Closing Date (the "Fractional Share
Consideration").

 

Section 2.10 Further Action If, at any time prior to or after the Effective
Time, any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are determined
by the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC, the First-Step
Surviving Company or the Surviving Company to be reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the First-
Step Surviving Company or Surviving Company with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of the Company, the officers and
directors of the First-Step Surviving Company, Surviving Company and Parent
shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Integrated Mergers and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement.

corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or

1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act ("Significant Subsidiary") is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

power or authority would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of
the Company and each Significant Subsidiary, each as amended to date, and each

warranties set forth in Section 4.7, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of, and performance
by, the Company under this Agreement and any other documents and agreements

and assuming the accuracy of Parent's, Holdings', Merger Sub's and Merger Sub
LLC's representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.7, no other

necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of and performance by the
Company under this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such

transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception").

 

(b) The affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the shares outstanding
on the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting, voting together as a
single class (the "Company Stockholder Approval") and the occurrence of the
Company Stockholder Advisory Vote, are the only votes of the holders of any
class or series of the Company's capital stock necessary to approve this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Integrated Mergers.

 

(c) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance and consummation by the Company of the Transactions, and the
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
assuming the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained or not required,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents, (ii)
assuming that each of the consents, authorizations and approvals referred to
in Section 3.4 are obtained (and any condition precedent to any such consent,
authorization or approval has been satisfied) and each of the filings referred
to in Section 3.4 are made and any applicable waiting periods referred to
therein have expired, violate any Law applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (iii) except as set forth on Section 3.3(c) of the Company

breach of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, any Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party, or result in the creation of a Lien, other than
any Permitted Lien, upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as
would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

interests of the stockholders of the Company, (iii) resolved, to recommend
that stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement and the Transactions
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the "Company
Board Recommendation") and (iv) amended the Rights Plan so that (A) neither
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will cause the rights therein to become exercisable and

of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective filing or
furnished dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), or in the
case of amendments thereto, as of the last such amendment, the Company SEC

thereunder, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and, except to the
extent that any information in any Company SEC Document has been revised or
superseded by a Company SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof, none of
the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended, the
date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

Section 3.6 Company Financial Statements.

 

(a) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Filed Company SEC Document, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, the consolidated financial statements of the Company (including

accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto (except as permitted by the rules and regulations of

consistent basis in all material respects during the periods involved and the
Company's normal accounting practices consistent with past practice in all
material respects (except (A) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (B)
as permitted by Regulation S-X), and (iii) present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company

dates and for the periods shown, in conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments and any
other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto).

 

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the statements and reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder for
the years ended October 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. Since October 31, 2013, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors or officers
has received from its auditors any written complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that the Company has engaged in improper accounting practices that are
material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries.

 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no director, officer,
agent, employee or other Person acting on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has, in any respect, (i) used any corporate or other funds for
unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to political activity to government officials or others
or established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of
Section 30A of the Exchange Act or (ii) accepted or received any unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or expenditures. Except as set forth in the
Filed Company SEC Documents, no event has occurred that would be required to
be reported pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

 

(d) Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company does not have any Knowledge of
(A) any material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or (B) any fraud that

contained in any Debt Financing Document, (y) the Debt Financing will not be
fully funded by the Financing Sources made available to Holdings on or prior

expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Documents, there are no (i)
conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing;
or (ii) side letters or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Debt

their obligations hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding
Parent's, Holdings', Merger Sub's, Merger Sub LLC's or any other Person's

sole asset is cash in a de minimis amount (less than $1,000) and its sole

Section 5.2 No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective directors,
officers and employees to, and shall instruct its Representatives to,
immediately cease all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any existing
discussion that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
and the Company further agrees that it shall request that all non-public
information previously provided by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any such Persons be promptly returned or destroyed in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and shall prohibit
access for anyone other than the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives to any electronic data room of
the Company in connection therewith. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, the Company shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to,
and shall direct its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof, (ii)
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any substantive
discussions (except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions
of this Section 5.2) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
non-public material information in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (iii)
enter into any letter of intent, agreement, contract, commitment or agreement
in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or enter into any agreement, contract or commitment
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions, or (iv) authorize, permit, or direct any Representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to take any action set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 5.2(a).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the date that the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of its or
their respective Representatives receives an unsolicited Takeover Proposal,
which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal and financial advisors, is or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) and their Representatives may engage in
negotiations and discussions with, or furnish any information and other access
to any Person making such Takeover Proposal and any of its Representatives
(provided that substantially concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours)
the Company makes available to Parent such information or access to the extent
such information or access was not previously made available to Parent);
provided that (i) prior to furnishing any material non-public information to
any such Person, the Company receives from the Person making such Takeover
Proposal an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such Person is
not already subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Company, (ii) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that a failure to furnish such information or access would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law, and (iii) the Company provides written notice to Parent immediately after
any such determination by the Company Board and before taking any of the
actions described in this sentence. In addition, from and after the date of
this Agreement, the Company will promptly (but in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent in writing of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal and (A) if
it is in writing, deliver to Parent a copy of such Takeover Proposal and any
related draft agreements and other written material relating to such Takeover
Proposal or (B) if oral, communicate to Parent the material terms and
conditions thereof, including, in each case, the identity of the Person making
such Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent reasonably apprised on a
reasonably timely basis of the status and material terms of such Takeover
Proposal and with respect to any change in the price or any material terms
thereof within 24 hours of such material change. From and after the date
hereof, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail

to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any
Person, unless the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that any such termination, amendment, modification, waiver or failure
to enforce any provision of any such "standstill" may occur only at the
initiation and request of the third party thereto.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company Board shall
not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub
LLC or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (including any failure to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement), (ii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail
to publicly recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer
for the Shares within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer
or against any Takeover Proposal (provided that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until the Company Board fails to
reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation by the close of business on the
tenth (10th) Business Days following the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer), (iv) other than with respect to the period of up to ten (10)
Business Days applicable to tender offer or exchange offers that are the
subject of the preceding clause (iii), fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) Business Days after Parent
so requests in writing, (v) enter into any definitive agreement providing for
a Takeover Proposal or (vi) resolve or publicly propose to take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) (each of the foregoing
actions described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may: (i) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to the Company receiving an unsolicited
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes
a Superior Proposal; or (ii) if the Company has complied (other than
immaterial breaches) with this Section 5.2, cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement and, prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, in all cases the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with and receiving
advice from outside counsel, that the failure to (1) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (2) terminate this Agreement and enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, as the case
may be, would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) Subject to Section 5.2(d), (i) no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made in response to a Superior Proposal and (ii) no termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.2(d) may be made unless: (A) the
Company complies in all material respects with this Section 5.2, (B) the
Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
5.2(d) at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking such action (a
"Company Board Recommendation Notice"), which notice shall specify in the case
of such action taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of
all of the relevant proposed transaction documents related thereto, including
definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal and any financing
commitments relating thereto); and (C) the Company shall have, (x) during the
three (3) Business Day period specified above (and any additional period
related to a revision of the Superior Proposal, as provided below),
negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any
adjustments

proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and no such
agreement is reached and (y) if applicable, prior to or substantially
concurrent with, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2(d),
pay the Termination Fee as set forth in Section 7.3(b).

 

(f) The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in connection
with a Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Board Recommendation Notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period (the
period inclusive of all such days, the "Notice Period"). The Company agrees
that: (i) during the Notice Period the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (if Parent indicates to the Company that it desires to negotiate) the
terms of this Agreement and (ii) the Company shall take into account all
changes and adjustments to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
determining whether such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of all
developments affecting the material terms of any such Superior Proposal (and
the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written
materials received that relate to such Superior Proposal).

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the Company
stockholders if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders under applicable Law, (iii)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.2 or (iv) except pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 5.2(c),
making any "stop, look and listen" communications to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act by the Company that
describes the Company's receipt of a Takeover Proposal (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); provided, that this
Section 5.2(g) shall not in and of itself be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change that would not otherwise
be permitted by Section 5.2(d) and any such statements or disclosures made by
the Company Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the provisions of Article VII (it being agreed the
actions in clauses (i)-(iv) in this Section 5.2(g), in and of themselves,
shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

Section 5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC and Merger Sub shall take, or cause
to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things reasonably necessary under any applicable Laws to cause the
Transactions to be consummated as soon as practicable, including (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Integrated Mergers, (ii)
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or
reversed, (iii) making as promptly as practicable and advisable any required
submissions, notices and filings under applicable Antitrust Laws or any other
applicable Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iv) promptly furnishing
information required in connection with such submissions and filing under such
Antitrust Laws, (v) keeping the other parties reasonably fully informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings under Antitrust
Laws, including with respect to: (A) the receipt of any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the expiration or termination of
any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened
commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial
action or proceeding under Antitrust Laws, or (D) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions, (vi) obtaining all actions or non-actions,
consents, orders, exemptions approvals, consents, waivers, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from, or avoiding an
investigation,

action, proceeding or other challenge of the legality of the Transactions by,
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable (collectively, the
"Approvals") and (vii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, Holdings, Merger
Sub LLC, Merger Sub and the Company shall not take any action after the date
of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Approval with respect to
Antitrust Laws or any other applicable Law necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report

the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree to a different date), (B)
supply as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR

make the appropriate filings under any Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable and advisable and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days
after the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree to a different
date), (B) supply as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be required or
reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority and (C) take or cause to be
taken all other actions consistent with this Section 5.3 as are reasonably
necessary to obtain any necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits,
authorizations or other actions or non-actions from each Governmental
Authority as soon as practicable.

 

(c) The Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC and Merger Sub shall each
keep the other reasonably fully informed of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the Integrated Mergers and work cooperatively in connection
with obtaining all required Approvals undertaken pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 5.3. In that regard, the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub
LLC and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the other parties hereto of, and
if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
between such Person and a Governmental Authority and permit the others to
review and discuss in advance (and to fully coordinate their responses with
respect to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental Authority,
(ii) keep the others reasonably fully informed of any developments, meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions, (iii) not independently

other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Authority. Each of Parent and Company may designate any non-public information
provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust
Counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with employees,
officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party without approval
of the party providing the non-public information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC shall, following
consultation with the Company and after giving due consideration to its views
and acting reasonably and in good faith, direct and control all aspects of the
parties' efforts to gain regulatory clearance either before any Governmental
Authority or in any action brought to enjoin the Transactions pursuant to any
Antitrust Laws; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.3 shall
prohibit either the Company or Parent, or their respective Representatives,
from communicating or having discussions with any Governmental Authority, so
long as the other party or its respective Representatives is provided
reasonable prior notice of any such communication or discussions and invited
to participate in such communications or discussions.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent, Holdings,
Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC agree to take promptly any and all steps
reasonably necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment
and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust
Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the
parties to close the Transactions as soon as practicable, including committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or
otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of
assets or businesses of Parent or Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or waiving existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating any
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries (each a "Remedial
Action"), as needed to enable the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Closing, by the End Date (such End Date, as used in this Section 5.3(d),
being the End Date without giving effect to the End Date Extension, though,
for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations set forth in this sentence shall
cease only upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
VII); provided, however, that any Remedial Action may, at the discretion of
Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable with respect to the Transactions
relating to any required submissions and filings or Approvals under applicable

proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
each of the Company and Parent shall take any and all action reasonably
necessary to avoid or resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding.

 

Section 5.4 Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, from the date hereof until the earlier of the

with its terms, each of the Company and Parent shall afford the other party
and its Representatives of the other party reasonable access during normal
business hours to its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, Tax
Returns, operating data and records and the Company and Parent, as applicable,
shall furnish promptly to the other party such information concerning its
business and properties and access to its Representatives, in each case, as
the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request (other than any
publicly available document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws); provided that Parent and the Company and
their respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
other party; provided, further, that the Company and Parent shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if such party determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would (i) cause significant competitive
harm to the other party if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) violate
applicable Law or any Contract or (iii) violate any legal duty, or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third-party, jeopardize the protection of the
attorney-client, work-product or other legal privilege (it being agreed that
the Company and Parent, as applicable shall give notice to the other party of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents, shall withhold
only that portion of such information that would not cause competitive harm if
the Transactions are not consummated, or is reasonably necessary to be
withheld to not violate such applicable Law, Contract, duty or obligation and
to preserve such attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege, as
applicable, and thereafter the Company or Parent, as the case may be shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause such harm, violate such
restriction or waive such privilege); provided, further, that nothing herein
shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental
testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries and nothing herein shall authorize the
Company or its respective Representatives to undertake any environmental
testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries. The information provided will be subject to
the terms of (i) the Company Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will
not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.4 for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to
the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 5.5 Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board shall each (i)
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation,
including any of the Takeover Laws, is or becomes applicable to Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC, the Company and the Transactions and
(ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute, including any of the
Takeover Laws, becomes applicable to the Transactions, use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on Parent, Holdings, Merger
Sub, Merger Sub LLC, the Company and the Transactions.

served as a director, officer, employee, agent, member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other

"Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") against all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses that have been
reasonably incurred (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding,
arbitration, audit, hearing, mediation or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a "Claim"), whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising out of, relating
to or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as
Indemnitees occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the Agreement or the
Transactions), in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under the Company
Charter Documents and applicable Law, and the Surviving Company shall assume
all obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of limitation of liability, exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses as provided in the (A) the Company Charter Documents
and the respective organizational documents of each of the Company
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee as set forth on Section 5.6(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue
in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date,
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Company to maintain in effect provisions for
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no less favorable
to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter Documents, the
applicable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee, in each case, in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were Indemnitees except
as required by applicable Law; provided, however, that all rights to
limitation of liability, indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses in respect of any Claim pending or asserted within such period shall
continue until the disposition or resolution of such Claim.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any
costs or expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section
5.6, or enforcement of an Indemnitee's rights under this Section 5.6, as and
when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification under applicable Law. Any determination required to be made
with respect to whether an Indemnitee's conduct complies with an applicable
standard under applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organizational documents of

Subsidiaries of the Company, or applicable indemnification agreements, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Claim, unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all of the Indemnitees covered by the Claim from all liability
arising out of such Claim. Nothing in this Section 5.6(c) shall relieve Parent
or the Surviving Company of its obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

 

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be
maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising prior to, at or on the Effective Time either
through the Company's existing insurance provider or another substitute
provider reasonably selected by Parent; provided, however, that, after the
Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase a
policy with the greatest coverage possible that does not exceed 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof and (ii)
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or the other
Parent Subsidiaries to, take any action that would prejudice the rights of, or
otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of such insurance, whether in
respect of claims arising before or after the Effective Time. In lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost per each year of "tail" insurance coverage no greater than
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof,
that provides coverage no materially less favorable than the coverage
described above.

 

(e) It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the Indemnitees to whom this
Section 5.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6 and
(ii) this Section 5.6 shall survive consummation of the Integrated Mergers and
the Transactions and shall be enforceable by such Indemnitees and their
respective successors, heirs and legal representatives against Parent and the
Surviving Company and their respective successors and assigns. The obligations
of the Surviving Company under this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated,
amended or modified in such a manner so as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee (including their successors, heirs and assigns) to whom this
Section 5.6 applies unless (A) such termination, amendment or modification is
required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee (or his or her
lawful successors, heirs or assigns) shall have consented in writing prior to
such termination, amendment or modification.

 

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided in this Section 5.6. The rights of each Indemnitee
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other applicable rights
such Indemnitee may have under the Company Charter Documents or any of the
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries or of the Surviving
Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL, DLLCA or otherwise.

 

(g) In the event the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

 

Section 5.7 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in (with its own counsel) at Parent's sole cost and
expense, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the
directors or

 

 

 

48  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​

 

 

officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions (any such litigation, a "Company
Transaction Litigation"), and the Company shall give due consideration to
Parent's advice with respect to any such litigation. The Company shall consult
with Parent regarding the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Company
Transaction Litigation; provided that none of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their Representatives shall compromise, settle, come to
an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle, or come to an
arrangement regarding any Company Transaction Litigation or consent to the
same unless Parent shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each of Parent and the Company
shall notify the other promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) of the
commencement of any Company Transaction Litigation of which it has received
notice.

 

Section 5.8 Section 16. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary
to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to such equity
securities of the Company) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.9 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or the
Company Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with, and subject to,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and the Company Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

Section 5.10 Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholders' Meeting.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare the Proxy Statement
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, with the Company's
reasonable cooperation, prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form
S-4 with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Transactions,
which will include the Proxy Statement with respect to the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
forty-five (45) days following the date hereof). Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent, to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4
complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective
through the Closing in order to permit the consummation of the Transactions.
Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the other and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, and shall,
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise the other of
any oral comments or communications with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment
from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent
without the Company's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
condition or delayed). Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the
threat or issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Integrated Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction (and Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension

lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated), or any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or comments thereon
or responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and
will promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from
the SEC or any state securities commission. Parent shall also use reasonable
best efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
Transactions, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, either the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
the prompt filing with the SEC of any appropriate amendment of, or supplement
to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this
Section 5.10(b) shall limit the obligations of any party hereto under Section
5.10(a). For purposes of this Section 5.10(b), any information concerning or
related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholders' Meeting
will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information
concerning or related to Parent or its affiliates will be deemed to have been
provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the effective date of the Form S-4,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter
Documents, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company stockholders for the sole purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote in accordance with
the DGCL and applicable Law (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"); provided,
however, that the Company Stockholders' Meeting shall be held no later than
twenty five (25) Business Days after the Form S-4 is declared effective
(unless adjourned or postponed in accordance with the terms of this Section
5.10). The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC has declared
the Form S-4 effective, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days
after the Form S-4 is declared effective. Subject to Section 5.2 hereof, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and hold the
Company Stockholder Advisory Vote at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, including soliciting from the Company
stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting except that the
Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders' Meeting, after consultation with Parent, (i) if the
failure to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting would
reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law or for the
distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement,
(ii) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders' Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) or rescheduled,
pursuant to this Section 5.10(c), there are insufficient shares of Company
Shares represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, (iii)
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval or (iv) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of
any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel) is necessary or required to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Laws or for the Company to comply with its obligations under
Section 5.2(e) and Section 5.2(f); provided, however, that in the event that
there are insufficient votes to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting, the Company may postpone

or adjourn the Company Stockholders' Meeting up to two (2) times for up to
thirty (30) days to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VII hereof, but subject to
Section 5.2(d) hereof, the Company's obligation to establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting
pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) shall not be limited to, or otherwise
affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Company of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 

(d) The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and NASDAQ. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant
to Article VII hereof, subject to the terms of Section 5.2 hereof, the Company
shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

 

Section 5.11 Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Documents (it being understood and agreed that, in the event that
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or could reasonably be expected to
become unavailable as a result of the automatic expiration and termination
thereof because the End Date is extended to a date later than May 24, 2017,
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternative Financing
pursuant to Section 5.11(e) below).

 

(b) Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, consent to
any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision (including any
condition) or remedy under, any Debt Financing Document (or any commitment in
respect thereof) without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), solely to
the extent such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination,
assignment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees, in each
case if such changes would reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing), (ii) impose new or additional conditions or any contingencies, or
otherwise amend, restate, replace, supplement, terminate, assign, modify or
expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing or (iii)
individually or in the aggregate with all other amendments, restatements,
replacements, supplements, terminations, assignments, modifications or
waivers, reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the
Closing, (B) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur at or prior
to the Effective Time, or (C) adversely impact the ability of each of Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Financing Documents or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto or delay, prevent or adversely impact the ability of each of
Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC to consummate the Transactions;
provided, however, that Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC may
(i) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, syndication agents, documentation agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) amend or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to implement
any flex provisions applicable thereto or (iii) otherwise amend, modify or
replace, or agree to any waivers in respect of, the Debt Commitment Letter so
long as, with respect to replacements, the replacement debt commitments
otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative Financing set
forth below. In the event of such amendment, restatement, replacement,
supplement, assignment, modification or waiver of any Debt Financing Document
as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such
amended, modified, restated, replaced, supplemented, assigned or waived Debt
Financing Document will be deemed to be "Debt Financing" as such term is used
in this Agreement.

(c) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to (I) maintain in effect each Debt Financing Document (including
any definitive agreements entered into in connection therewith (such
definitive agreements, collectively with the Debt Financing Documents, the
"Financing Agreements")) until the earlier of (x) the date that this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof and (y) the date that the
Debt Financing is funded in full, (II) satisfy on a timely basis (but in any
event prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing) all terms, covenants and
conditions in the Financing Agreements applicable to Holdings, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub LLC and their respective Affiliates and Representatives (and that
are within their control) to obtaining the Debt Financing, (III) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Documents (as modified, to the
extent exercised by the applicable Financing Sources, by the flex provisions
applicable thereto solely to the extent required pursuant to the applicable
Debt Fee Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or on other terms
permitted under Section 5.11(b) and that are not materially less beneficial to
Holdings than those included in the Debt Financing Documents as in effect on
the date hereof (including with respect to the conditionality thereof), and
(IV) if the Marketing Period has ended, and if all of the conditions to
Parent's, Holdings', Merger Sub's and Merger Sub LLC's obligations under
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or, with respect
to Section 6.2 only, waived, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing (including by taking enforcement actions against the Financing
Sources, which may include specific performance against such Financing
Sources).

 

(d) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the
status of Holdings', Merger Sub's and Merger Sub LLC's efforts to obtain the
Debt Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and
updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status,
proposed Closing Date and material terms of the material definitive
documentation for the Debt Financing. Parent will promptly provide to the
Company copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing including any
amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment,
modification or waiver thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any
breach, default, repudiation, cancellation, amendment, restatement,
replacement, supplement, termination, assignment, modification or waiver (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to the same) by any party to any
Financing Agreement of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of any
Debt Financing Agreement or (ii) if for any reason Parent believes in good
faith that there is a possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Agreements.

 

(e) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or could
reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions and
from the sources contemplated by the applicable Financing Agreements (giving
effect to the flex provisions applicable thereto), including as a result of
the automatic expiration and termination thereof because the End Date is
extended to a date later than May 24, 2017, (i) Parent will promptly notify
the Company and (ii) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions (it being understood that the terms
of Section 5.11(b) will apply to such alternative financing, and, subject to
Section 5.11(j), Parent shall have no obligation (except in the case of the
automatic expiration and termination of any Financing Agreement because the
End Date is extended to a date later than May 24, 2017) to accept any terms or
conditions that are materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Holdings,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and the Company than the terms and conditions set
forth in the applicable Financing Agreements immediately prior to giving
effect to the terms of such alternative financing) ("Alternative Financing")
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. In such
event, as applicable: (1) the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement
will be deemed to include any such Alternative Financing, (2) the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include any commitment letters with
respect to any such Alternative Financing and (3) the term "Financing
Agreements" will be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to
the Alternative Financing.

property and personal property that would constitute collateral under the Debt
Financing Documents, solely for the purpose of establishing pledges over such
assets to secure the obligations under the Debt Financing Documents, in each
case which shall not be required to be delivered or effective until at or
promptly following the Effective Time, (vi) subject to any contractual
agreement in effect, solely with respect to the Company Credit Agreements,

order to pay off in full all obligations in connection therewith or secured
thereby, such release, termination and/or discharge shall be effective, (vii)
preparing and delivering to Parent any supplements to the above information
such that it will not contain (after giving effect to all supplements thereto)

necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were or are made, not materially
misleading, to the extent required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter,
(viii) furnishing Parent and its Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably
practical with all documentation and other information required by regulatory

and (ix) providing reasonable assistance with arrangements for (1) satisfying
the requirements in the Company's Indenture dated as of April 18, 2011 (as

respective Representatives shall have no funding obligation in connection
therewith, and it being understood that Parent's counsel shall provide all

the Company, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (or such later date
as may be extended under the Exchange Act).

 

(g) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Company's and the
Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing in a form
and manner mutually agreed with the Company; provided, however, that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely,
to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. The
Company will, upon the reasonable written request of Parent, use its
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information (to
the extent it is available) to be included in any Syndication Document to be
used in connection with such Debt Financing so that Parent may ensure that any
such Required Information is Compliant.

 

(h) Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 5.11(f), (i) solely Parent
shall be responsible for provision of any pro forma financial information,
including cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro
forma adjustments (provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, solely to the
extent such financial information is available without unreasonable effort and
expense and does not include separate financial statements for any of the
Company Subsidiaries, the Company shall provide Parent with financial and
other information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Parent to allow Parent to prepare such pro forma
financial information) and any financial projections of the Company, (ii)
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives shall be required to enter into or approve (or commit to enter
into or approve) any certificate, document, agreement, instrument or Financing
Agreement, in each case which will be effective prior to the Effective Time,
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.11(h)(ii) shall limit the
covenants of the Company to cooperate with Parent in connection with the
Satisfaction and Discharge Transaction, (iii) nothing herein shall require
cooperation contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, (iv) none of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates will be required to
pay or commit to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability

approving or authorizing the same or any actions in connection therewith, in
each case to the extent the same would be effective prior to the Effective
Time, (vi) nothing herein will involve any binding commitment by the Company,

accordance with this Section 5.11) and costs and expenses incurred in
defending against the foregoing, and any information used in connection
therewith, except (i) to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or

for the account of the applicable lenders) under the Company Credit
Agreements.

modify any representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to
any obligation of any party hereunder or (2) update any section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, and
provided, further, that the failure to comply with this Section 5.15 shall not

or wage rate, short-term incentive opportunities, and employee benefits, in
the aggregate, provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and the

following the Effective Time (the "Parent Plans"), Parent, Holdings and the
Surviving Company shall credit each employee with his or her years of service
with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to
the same extent as such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing
to credit for such service under any similar plan and to the extent legally
permitted, except where such crediting would result in duplication of benefits
and for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan.

 

(c) Subject to any required consent by any insurer (including, if applicable,
a stop-loss insurer of a self-funded plan), which consent Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Company to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the continuing employees under any health and
welfare plans in which such employees are eligible to participate at or after

applicable Company Plan or Non-U.S. Company Plan and (ii) provide each
continuing employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any health and welfare plans in which such employee is

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.19 with respect to employees of the Company and the Company

Plan, Non-U.S. Company Plan or Parent Plan, except for the rights of holders
of Options, Restricted Stock or Performance Units pursuant to Section 2.3 of
this Agreement, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Holdings, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate

be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent,
Holdings, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent nor shall it
interfere with any such Person's right to amend, modify or terminate any plan

reason.

Article VII 

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained (except as noted below), this Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or

 

(b) by either of the Company or Parent upon written notice to the other party:

 

(i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before February 24,
2017; provided, however, that if on February 24, 2017, the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall not have been satisfied but all
other conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied (or in the case of
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, shall be
capable of being satisfied on February 24, 2017) or waived by all parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, then, at the election of either
Parent or the Company, such date may be extended to August 24, 2017 (the "End
Date Extension") if such party provides written notice to the other party on
or prior to February 24, 2017 (February 24, 2017, as such date may be extended

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to (A) a party if the failure of the Integrated Mergers to have been
consummated on or before the End Date was primarily due to the failure of such
party to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
such party set forth in this Agreement (B) Parent, if Parent has made an
Alternative Funding Election pursuant to Section 2.1(e);

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(a) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if such final, non-appealable Restraint was
primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if a meeting of the Company stockholders is duly convened (or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof) and the Company Stockholder Approval is
not obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a final
vote taken at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; or

 

(c) by Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time, upon written notice to
the Company:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(b), and (B) by its
nature, cannot

 

 

 

60  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

be cured by the Company by the End Date or, if such breach or failure is
capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company shall not have cured such
breach or failure within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of
written notice from Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable
detail; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if it is then in breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
Section 6.3(b); or

 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
contemplated by Section 6.1(b), in the event of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; or

 

(d) by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time (except as noted
below), upon written notice to Parent:

 

(i) if Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (excluding, for purposes of this
Section 7.1(d)(i), its obligations to consummate the Integrated Mergers in
accordance with Section 1.2), which breach or failure to perform (A) if it
occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and (B)
by its nature, cannot be cured by Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC or Merger
Sub by the End Date or, if such breach or failure is capable of being cured by
the End Date, Parent shall not have cured such breach or failure within thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company
describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail; provided that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(d)(i) if it is then in breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b); or

 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, in accordance with Section 5.2; provided that the Company
substantially concurrently with such termination pays or causes to be paid the
Termination Fee contemplated in Section 7.3 (provided that Parent shall have
provided wiring instructions for such payment or, if not, then such payment
shall be paid promptly following delivery of such instructions); it being
understood that the Company may enter into any transaction that is a Superior
Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2 simultaneously with the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii).

 

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which

void and of no effect and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall
cease (other than the penultimate sentence in Section 5.4, Section 5.11(h),
Section 5.11(i), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, and Article VIII, all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective directors, officers and Affiliates hereunder; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 7.3 (including the limitations on liability
contained therein), none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC, Merger Sub or
the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of any breach of this Agreement that occurs prior to termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1; provided, further, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
arising out of or resulting of, fraud or any willful and material breach of
any covenant or agreement or willful and material breach of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement occurring prior to termination, in which case
the aggrieved party shall not be limited to expense reimbursement or any fee
payable pursuant to Section 7.3, and shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies available at law or in equity. The Confidentiality Agreements shall
survive in accordance with their terms following the termination of this
Agreement.

on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and Parent' stockholders, that in the
event that Parent receives full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 7.3, (i) the receipt of the Termination Fee shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, its Affiliates and Parent's stockholders
and shall be compensation and deemed to be liquidated damages (A) for any and

any of their respective Affiliates or Parent's stockholders under this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements (and the termination of any of the
foregoing), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination (except in the case of fraud or a
willful and material breach), and (iii) Parent shall not be entitled to bring
or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company
Related Party for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement (other than equitable relief to require payment
of the Termination Fee) or the Confidentiality Agreements, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except in
the case of fraud or a willful and material breach). Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that, subject to Section 7.2, payment of the Termination
Fee and the Parent Expenses are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, as the
case may be, in the circumstances in which payment of such Termination Fee or
the Parent Expenses is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount
equal to $20,000,000.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Termination Fee, referred to in this Section 7.3 (i) on more than
one occasion or (ii) if, at the time this Agreement is terminated by (x)
Parent, this Agreement could have been terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(i), or (y) the Company, this Agreement
could have been terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or Section
7.1(c)(i).

Section 8.3 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to Section 5.6, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any
and all respects, but only by written agreement of the parties hereto executed
by duly authorized officers of the respective parties; provided, however, that
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, if applicable, there
shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ would require further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval. In the
event that any party seeks an amendment to or waiver of, this Section 8.3
(Amendment or Supplement), Section 8.7 (Entire Agreement; Third-Party
Beneficiaries), Section 8.8 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction), Section 8.10

however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, if
applicable, there shall be made no waiver that by Law (including the relevant
rules and regulations of NASDAQ) requires further approval by the stockholders
of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub LLC or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC or
Merger Sub may assign any or all of their rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any Financing Source for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral
in respect of such Debt Financing or to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(although no such assignment shall relieve Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC
and Merger Sub of their obligations to the other parties hereunder) without
the consent of the Company. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this Section 8.5 shall be null and
void.

 

Section 8.6 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Section 8.7 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
together with the other instruments referred to herein, including the
Confidentiality Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, (b) except (i) the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock,
Options, Restricted Stock and Performance Units to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article II and (ii) pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5.6, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder and (c) each of
Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree that their respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing to the contrary, each Financing Source is an express third-party
beneficiary of Section 8.3 (Amendment or Supplement), Section 8.7 (Entire
Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries), Section 8.8 (Governing Law;
Jurisdiction), Section 8.10 (Waiver of Jury Trial) and Section 8.13 (Non-

Section 8.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Transactions and the negotiation, execution
performance and enforcement of this Agreement or the Transactions, including
all litigation, claims, actions, suits, hearings or proceedings (whether
civil, criminal or administrative and whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub LLC, Merger Sub or
the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of
this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware;

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
action or proceeding, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or
otherwise, involving any Financing Source arising out of, or relating to, the
Transactions, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably (i) agrees that all
litigation, claims, actions, suits, hearings or proceedings (whether civil,
criminal or administrative and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise),
directly or directly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Transactions and the negotiation, execution, performance and enforcement of
this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment with
respect of this Agreement or the Transactions and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder brought by the other parties hereto or their respective
successors or assigns, shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom with
the State of Delaware, or, if such court declines to accept jurisdiction over
a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware,
(ii) submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court and (iii) a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(c) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 8.8 in any
such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified
United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address
as specified in or pursuant to this Article VIII. However, the foregoing shall
not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees (i) that any action or proceeding, whether in contract
or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, involving any Financing Source
arising out of, or relating to, the Transactions, the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related
thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof) and each party submits for itself and its property with respect to
any such action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and
agrees not to bring (or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing) any such action or proceeding in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 

Section 8.9 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that, subject to the
provisions of this Section 8.9, immediate, extensive and irreparable damage
would occur for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with their specific
terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for
any reason any of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC or the Company
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise
breached this Agreement, then, in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it, including monetary damages, the party seeking to

TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

 

 

enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement
shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate
injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing, obtaining, furnishing or posting of
any bond, security or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any such injunctive or other equitable relief and each party
waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have
to require the obtaining, securing, furnishing or posting of any such bond,
security or similar instrument, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity
except as may be limited by Section 7.3. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity.

 

Section 8.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR TORT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM THAT INVOLVES THE FINANCING
SOURCES.

Section 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced then such term or provision shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and all other terms, provisions and conditions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith

liability (whether in contract, tort or any other theory of liability) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transactions; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.13 shall limit
any liability of the parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its
respective Affiliates, that none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company or its Affiliates relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions (including the Debt Financing).
