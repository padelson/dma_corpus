the Participating Stockholders from the Escrow Fund upon release of the
amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as a payment of interest to the
Participating Stockholders by Parent, except as otherwise required by a
taxing authority. The parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse
funds to the Stockholder Representative for payment to the Participating
Stockholders within thirty (30) days following each calendar year in an
amount equal to the net amount of all earnings on investments of such
cash deposit held in the Escrow Fund allocable to the Participating
Stockholders earned in such calendar year multiplied by forty-five percent
(45%).   3.2 Allocations Spreadsheet. Three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated draft of
the Allocations Spreadsheet reflecting (i) the deduction of (x) the
Transaction Expenses deducted from the calculation of the Initial Closing
Consideration and (y) the Initial Escrow Amount as determined pursuant to
Section 3.1(k), and (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. At the Closing, the

shall be prepared in consultation with Parent in order that Parent may
confirm the information contained therein, setting forth the final
calculation of the amounts for distribution in accordance with Section
3.1.   3.3 Additional Consideration Spreadsheet. Within ten (10) Business
Days following the earlier of (a) the date the Northrop Grumman
Shipped Revenue first equals or exceeds $35,000,000 or (b) June 30, 2008,
Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement setting
forth its calculation of the Northrop Grumman Shipped Revenue, the Additional
Total Consideration, the allocation of the Additional Total Consideration
among the holders of Series C-3 Preferred Stock in accordance with Section
3.1, the allocation of the Employee Incentive Plan Additional Allocation
Amount among the Plan Participants and the allocation of the Special
Acquisition Bonus Additional Allocation Amount among those entitled to the

reasonably necessary to determine the accuracy of such calculations and
allocations (the "ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION SPREADSHEET"). The Stockholder
Representative shall notify Parent, within twenty (20) Business Days of its
receipt of the Additional Consideration Spreadsheet, of any objections to the
calculations and allocations set forth therein. If the Stockholder
Representative agrees with the calculations and allocations set forth in the
Additional Consideration Spreadsheet by providing written notice thereof to
Parent or does not raise any written objection thereto to Parent within such
twenty (20) Business Day period, Parent, within five (5) Business Days
thereafter, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each Participating
Stockholder, Plan Participant and Bonus Participant, either a cash amount
and/or a certificate (or evidence of shares in book entry form) representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any) such holder is entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 3.1(e), Section 3.1(f)(ii) and Section 3.1(g)(ii) and as set
forth in the Additional Consideration Spreadsheet. In the event the   
28  Stockholder Representative objects to the calculations or allocations
set forth in the Additional Consideration Spreadsheet, the parties shall
resolve the dispute pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 9.3(e).
Parent shall have no obligation to make any cash payments or issue any shares
of Parent Common Stock under this Section 3.3 until a final determination has
been made pursuant to Section 9.3(e).   3.4 Earnout Consideration
Spreadsheets. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the end of each
of the calendar years 2007, 2008 and 2009, but not later than the earlier of
(a) 120 days following the end of such calendar year or (b) the date of
completion of the audit of Parent\'s financial statements for such calendar
year, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement
setting forth its calculation of the applicable Shipped Revenue, the
applicable Earnout Amount, the applicable Earnout Merger Consideration
Amount, the applicable Employee Incentive Plan Earnout Allocation Amount, the
Special Acquisition Bonus Earnout Allocation Amount and the allocation of
such amounts to the Participating Stockholders, the Plan Participants and the
Bonus Participant in accordance with this Agreement, together with such
supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to determine the accuracy
of such calculations and allocations (each, an "EARNOUT CONSIDERATION
SPREADSHEET"). The Stockholder Representative shall, within twenty (20)
Business Days of its receipt of each Earnout Consideration
Spreadsheet, notify Parent of any objections to the calculations and
allocations set forth therein. If the Stockholder Representative agrees with
the calculations and allocations set forth in such Earnout Consideration
Spreadsheet by providing written notice thereof to Parent or does not raise
any written objection thereto to Parent within such twenty (20) Business Day
period, Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, deliver or
cause to be delivered to each Participating Stockholder, each Plan
Participant and Bonus Participant a cash amount and/or a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book entry form) representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
and, at the election of Parent, cash in lieu of any shares of Parent Common
Stock in order to comply with applicable securities Laws) such person is
entitled to receive in accordance with this Agreement and as set forth in
such Earnout Consideration Spreadsheet. In the event the Stockholder
Representative objects to the calculations or allocations set forth in an
Earnout Consideration Spreadsheet, the parties shall resolve the dispute
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 9.3(e). Parent shall have no
obligation to make any cash payments or issue any shares of Parent Common
Stock under this Section 3.4 until a final determination has been
made pursuant to Section 9.3(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that at the time of payment of the 2007 Earnout Amount such amount still has
the potential to increase as a result of the Company\'s receipt of
additional payments associated with Booked Revenue included in the 2007
Earnout Amount, then additional Earnout Consideration Spreadsheets shall be
delivered and the foregoing process shall be repeated on a monthly basis with
respect to the 2007 Earnout Amount until the earlier of (i) such time that
the maximum 2007 Earnout Amount has been achieved, or (ii) December 31,
2009.   3.5 Exchange of Certificates.    29   (a) Exchange Procedure.
Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall mail, or shall cause to be mailed, to
each Participating Stockholder, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates formerly representing any shares of Company Stock (the
"CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
Parent), substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the applicable Merger
consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which holders of
Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(b) and cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.5(g). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as
may reasonably be required by Parent), the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the applicable cash payment,
(B) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III after taking into account all the shares of Company Stock then
held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (C) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.5(b) and (D) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(g), and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon
presentation to Parent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.5(a), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration Payments, any dividends or other distributions to which the
holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(b) and cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.5(g), in each case, without interest.   (b)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder
thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.5(g), in each case until the holder
of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article III. Following surrender of any Certificate in accordance with
this    30  Article III, there shall be paid to the record holder
thereof, without interest, (i) promptly following the time of such surrender,
the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(g) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions, payable with respect to that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for such
Certificate pursuant to this Article III, with a record date after the
Effective Time and paid with respect to Parent Common Stock prior to such
surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (c) Transfer
Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any dividends or
other distributions paid pursuant to Section 3.5(b) and cash paid in lieu of
any fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.5(g)) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificates
(other than any right to receive Additional Merger Consideration Amounts,
Earnout Merger Consideration Amounts and amounts that may be released from
escrow pursuant to this Agreement), and at the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   (d)
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent in lieu of the Person\'s agreement to indemnify
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, Parent will issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger consideration,
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(g), in each
case pursuant to this Agreement.   (e) No Liability. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Company shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or cash from the Escrow Fund, in    31  each case delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.   (f) Withholding Taxes. Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares
of Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement or a Plan Participant or a
Bonus Participant such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be treated as though they withheld from the type of
consideration from which withholding is required, an appropriate amount
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any such Person in order to
provide for such withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be
treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Person. If withholding is required from shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent
shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash
equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.
For the purposes of reporting compensation income and calculating the
applicable income and employment tax withholding with respect to the payments
to the Plan Participants and the Bonus Participant, the Company shall be
deemed the owner of the portion of the Escrow Fund allocable to the Plan
Participants and Bonus Participants and the applicable information reporting
and the timing and amount subject to income and employment tax withholding
shall be based upon the amounts actually received by the Plan Participants
and the Bonus Participant, whether paid by the Escrow Agent or by the Company
or Parent. Furthermore, the Company shall be entitled to an
annual distribution of forty-five percent (45%) of the amount of the earnings
on such Plan Participants\' and Bonus Participant\'s investments of the cash
portion of the Escrow Fund.   (g) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the Merger Consideration Payments, no dividends or other distributions
of Parent shall relate to such fractional shares and such fractional shares
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu of such fractional shares, Parent shall pay to each holder
of a Certificate (at such time as Parent is required to deliver any
applicable Merger consideration to such holder) an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share to which such
holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
applicable Average Parent Stock Price.   (h) Tax Treatment. The parties
agree that a portion of the consideration paid post-closing pursuant to this
Article III shall be treated as interest pursuant to Section 483 of the
Code.   3.6 Appraisal Rights.    32   (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
(the "SHARES") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger consideration (the "DISSENTING SHARES"),
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and
at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
holder\'s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the applicable Merger Consideration Payments for each such Share, in
accordance with Section 3.1(c), without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.   (b) If
the Dissenting Shares represent more than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding Shares of Company Stock (the excess being the "EXCESS SHARES"),
then an adjustment shall be made to the relative proportion of cash and
Shares of Parent Common Stock in the Initial Merger Consideration Amount such
that the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock will be increased and
the amount of cash will be decreased by the amount of cash that would have
been paid on account of the Excess Shares had those shares received all cash
in the transaction (to the extent such shares were entitled to receive a
portion of the Initial Merger Consideration Amount pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement), with such adjustment being reflected in the final
Allocations Spreadsheet.   3.7 Working Capital Adjustment   (a) No later
than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Parent the Pre-Closing Statement (as defined below)
and a certificate based on such Pre-Closing Statement setting forth the
Company\'s calculation of estimated Closing Working Capital (as defined
below). The pre-closing statement (the "PRE-CLOSING STATEMENT") shall present
the Company\'s estimate of Working Capital as of the    33  close of
business on the Closing Date ("ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL"). "WORKING CAPITAL"
means the cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable (including recoverable
value added Tax), inventory held for sale and trial equipment of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (but excluding deferred revenue and deferred inventory
cost), reduced by the accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(exclusive of Transaction Expenses and any amounts payable with respect to
the Employee Incentive Plan or the Special Acquisition Bonus), in each case
as determined in accordance with GAAP, applied using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications that were used in the preparation of the Company\'s audited
Financial Statements delivered in satisfaction of Section 8.1(1). Parent and
the Company shall agree on the calculations set forth in the Pre-
Closing Statement prior to the Closing Date. For the purposes of the
calculations in this Section 3.7(a), the absolute value of any negative
numbers shall be used.   (i) If the Estimated Working Capital is less than
the  product of (x) 0.85 and (y) the Projected Working Capital as  of the
Closing Date, the Initial Escrow Amount shall be  reduced by the difference
between (1) such product and (2) the  Estimated Working Capital, with such
cash and shares of Parent  Common Stock being retained by Parent and no
longer being  available as Initial Closing Consideration.   (ii) If the
Estimated Working Capital is greater than  the Projected Working Capital as
of the Closing Date, the  Initial Closing Consideration shall be increased by
the excess  of (1) the Estimated Working Capital over (2) the Projected 
Working Capital if such excess is the result of cash reflected  on the Pre-
Closing Statement obtained through the issuance  after the date hereof of
equity of the Company or debt  convertible into equity of the Company at or
prior to the  Effective Time issued in compliance with Section
7.2(b)(ii).   (b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Stockholder Representative the Closing Statement (as defined
below) and a certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth
Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital (as defined below). The
closing statement (the "CLOSING STATEMENT") shall present the actual Working
Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date ("CLOSING WORKING
CAPITAL").   (c) Subsequent to the Closing and upon reasonable
notice, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Stockholder
Representative reasonable access during normal working hours to the Surviving
Corporation\'s properties, books, Contracts and records reasonably necessary
to evaluate the Closing Statement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall furnish promptly to the Stockholder Representative, pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement, all such information concerning the
business, properties, books, Contracts, records and personnel (including
outside auditor    34  work papers) as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request for the purposes of evaluating the Closing Statement.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall make available to the officers,
employees, accountants, outside auditors, counsel and other representatives
of the Stockholder Representative upon the reasonable request of the
Stockholder Representative and during normal working hours all officers,
employees accountants, outside auditors, counsel and other representatives or
agents of the Surviving Corporation and Parent for discussion of such matters
pertaining to the Closing Statement as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request. If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with
Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 3.7(b), the Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Closing Statement to the Stockholder Representative,
deliver a notice to Parent (a "DISPUTE Notice") stating that the Stockholder
Representative disagrees with such calculation and specifying in reasonable
detail those items or amounts as to which the Stockholder Representative
disagrees and the basis therefore. Upon expiration of such thirty-day period,
if the Stockholder Representative has not provided a Dispute Notice in
accordance with this Section 3.7(c), the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with the calculation of Closing Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 3.7(b).   (d) If a Dispute Notice shall be
duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.7(c), the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the Closing Working
Capital. If during such period the Stockholder Representative and Parent are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Deloitte
and Touche or such other independent accounting firm as shall be mutually
agreed by Parent and Stockholder Representative, as the case may be (the
"INDEPENDENT Accountant"), to review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being
understood that in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall
be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). Each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agrees that it shall not engage or agree to engage
the Independent Accountant to perform any services other than as the
Independent Accountant pursuant hereto until the Closing Statement and Final
Closing Working Capital (as defined below) have been finally determined
pursuant to this Section 3.7. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by
the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant
and promptly provide all documents and information reasonably requested by
the Independent Accountant. In making such calculation, the Independent
Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
Statement and Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which
the Stockholder Representative has indicated it disagrees in its
Dispute Notice. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as practicable (but in any
case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Independent Accountant), a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on Parent and the
Stockholder    35  Representative, and neither Parent nor the Stockholder
Representative shall seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals,
other than to enforce such report. The cost of the Independent Accountant\'s
review and report shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative.   (e) The Stockholder Representative, Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of
Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this
Section 3.7, including by making available to the extent necessary books,
records, work papers and personnel.   (f) (i) If Final Closing Working
Capital is less than the product of (x) 0.85 and (y) the Projected Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to withdraw from the
Escrow Fund, and the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to release from the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to difference between
(1) such product and (2) Final Closing Working Capital; provided, however,
that such amount to be released from the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by the
amount not deposited into the Escrow Fund and retained by Parent pursuant to
Section 3.7(a)(i); and provided further, that such amount to be released to
Parent from the Escrow Fund shall be increased by the amount of any increase
in the Initial Closing Consideration effected pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(ii).
For the purposes of the calculations in this Section 3.7(f), the absolute
value of any negative numbers shall be used.   (ii) If Final Closing
Working Capital is greater than  the Projected Working Capital as of the
Closing Date, and if  such excess is the result of cash reflected on the Pre-
Closing  Statement obtained through the issuance after the date hereof  of
equity of the Company or debt convertible into equity of  the Company at or
prior to the Effective Time issued in  compliance with Section 7.2(b)(ii),
the Initial Closing  Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the
excess  and distributed in accordance with the Allocations Spreadsheet  in
the manner and with interest as provided in Section 3.7(g);  provided,
however, that the amount of such payment shall be  reduced by the amount of
any increase in the Initial Closing  Consideration effected pursuant to
Section 3.7(a)(ii); and  provided further, that the amount of such payment
shall be  increased by the amount not deposited into the Escrow Fund and 
retained by Parent pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(i).   (iii) If it is
determined that Final Closing Working  Capital should not result in any
adjustment to the Escrow Fund  or the Initial Closing Consideration, and an
adjustment was  made pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(i) or Section 3.7(a)(ii),
(A)  Parent shall deposit, on its behalf and on behalf of the  Company, in
the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the amount not  deposited into the Escrow
Fund and retained by Parent pursuant  to Section 3.7(a)(i) or (B) Parent
shall be entitled to  withdraw from the Escrow Fund, and the Stockholder 
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from  the Escrow
Fund, an amount equal to the amount of any increase  in the Initial Closing
Consideration effected pursuant to  Section 3.7(a)(ii).   36   (iv)
"FINAL CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL" means Closing  Working Capital (i) as shown
in Parent\'s calculation set forth  in the Closing Statement delivered
pursuant to Section 3.7(b)  if no Dispute Notice with respect thereto is duly
delivered  pursuant to Section 3.7(c); or (ii) if a Dispute Notice is 
delivered, (A) as agreed by the Stockholder Representative and  Parent
pursuant to Section 3.7(d) or (B) in the absence of  such agreement, as shown
in the Independent Accountant\'s  calculation delivered pursuant to Section
3.7(d).   (g) Any payment by Parent or Company to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.7(f) shall be made
within one (1) Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital has been
determined by wire transfer by Parent or Company to the Exchange Agent of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the Allocations Spreadsheet. The amount of
any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at the
Prime Rate during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed.   ARTICLE IV   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT
AND WAIVER   4.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time as follows:   (a) At the
election of either Parent or the Company on or after August 31, 2007 (the

enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental Body that would make consummation of the Merger illegal;   (d)

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, if
there shall have been a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
which breach    37  would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth
in Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) and is incapable of being cured or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within twenty (20) Business
Days following receipt by the Company of notice of such breach from Parent;
or   (e) by the Company, so long as the Company is not in material breach
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under

of being cured, shall not have been cured within twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach from the Company.  
4.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement

other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than this Section 4.2 and Article X, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement); provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any
willful breach hereof.   ARTICLE V   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and
Merger Sub on the date hereof that, subject to such exceptions

a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified or authorized to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property and each other
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties requires such qualification or authorization, except where the
failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company (a "COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT"). The Company is not subject to the requirements of Section
2115(b) of the California Corporations Code.   38   5.2 Authorization of
Agreement.   (a) The Company has all requisite power, authority and
legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement

and each of the Company Documents by the Company, the Company\'s performance
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by its Board of Directors and, subject to obtaining the
Stockholder Consents, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (b) Each Company Document has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto) this

executed and delivered will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Company, as applicable, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

duly called and held at which all the directors of the Company were present
in person or by telephone (or, in lieu of a meeting, by the written consent

(i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) directing that the

Company Subsidiary is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or
other entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and is duly qualified or authorized to do
business as a foreign corporation or entity and is in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership of its properties requires such qualification or authorization,
except where the failure to hold such foreign qualifications
or authorizations has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary has all
requisite corporate or entity power and authority to own its properties and
carry on its business as presently conducted. The outstanding shares of
capital stock or equity interests of each Company Subsidiary are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such shares or other equity

clear of any and all Liens and are not subject to any option, right of first
refusal, proxy, voting trust or agreement, or transfer restriction under any
shareholder or similar agreement, except as set forth in Schedule 5.5. No
shares of capital stock are held by any Company Subsidiary as treasury stock.
There is no existing option, warrant, call, right or Contract to which any
Company Subsidiary is a party requiring, and there are no convertible
securities of any Company Subsidiary outstanding which upon conversion would
require, the issuance of any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of any Company Subsidiary or other securities convertible into
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Company Subsidiary.
Other than the Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company    42  nor any
Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock
or equity or ownership interests in any other Person (collectively, "THIRD-

"COMPANY PLANS"), maintained by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that
would be treated as under common control or as a single employer, with any of
them under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an "ERISA
AFFILIATE") or to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributed or,

Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
any related trust thereunder intended to be exempt from Federal income

a favorable determination letter, prior to the expiration of the

IRS pronouncements, but has not yet received a response; (ii) obtained at

the Code.    58   (d) Except as otherwise provided in Schedule 5.16(d),
none of the Company Plans provides for post-employment life or health

the Code has complied with the notice and continuation requirements of
COBRA.   (e) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.16(e), as contemplated by

result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits under any Company Plan or Title IV Plan.   (f) (i) Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.16(f)(i), the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute an
event under any Company Plan, employee agreement, trust or loan that will or
may reasonably be expected to result in any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise and including forgiveness of indebtedness), acceleration,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits under any Company Plan or
employee arrangement or compensation to any Employee, or obligation to fund
compensation or benefits with respect to any Employee. (ii) Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.16(f)(ii), no payment or benefit which will or may be
made under any Company Plan or Company employee agreement in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company or
Parent or any of their respective affiliates with respect to any Employee
will be characterized as an "excess parachute payment," within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.   (g) Except as otherwise set forth in
Schedule 5.16(g), with respect to any employee benefit plans, programs,
agreements, policies, schemes arrangement or payroll practices that are

administered satisfies all applicable Laws, in all material respects, (ii)
all contributions to each Foreign Plan required through the Closing have been
and will be made (or accrued) by the Company, (iii) each Foreign Plan is

Company, by any Governmental Body involving any Foreign Plan nor any pending
claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
Foreign Plans), suits or proceedings against any Foreign Plan or asserting
any rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign Plan; and (v)
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
by itself create or otherwise result in any material liability with respect
to any    59  Foreign Plan. Without derogating from the above, the
Company\'s obligations to provide severance pay to its employees are fully
funded or have been properly provided for in the Company\'s financial
statements. All other liabilities of the Company relating to its employees
(excluding liabilities for illness pay) were properly accrued in the

and Parent and Merger Sub disclaims any other representations or warranties,
whether made by Parent or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article VI (as modified by the Parent Disclosure

representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or
information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to the

parties cooperate as to how the contact or meeting should be conducted.

information or (B) contravene any Law or Order.   7.2 Conduct of the

in this Agreement or permitted with the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and is
sufficient if evidenced by an email from Parent\'s chief executive officer,
chief financial officer or chief legal counsel) or otherwise required by Law
or Order, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not and shall not permit the Company Subsidiaries

promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of (i) any
representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by
Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect if such would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) or (ii) the failure of it (and, in
the case of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.   7.4 Fees and Expenses.
Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein,
including the Transaction Expenses, shall be    72  paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
Transaction Expenses (outstanding as of the Closing) up to $3,000,000 shall
be paid by the Company, and all Transaction Expenses (outstanding as of the
Closing) in excess of $3,000,000 shall be paid as follows: 50% of all such
Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the Company, and 50% shall be deducted
from the Initial Closing Consideration. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent, no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, pay-off letters in respect of the
Transaction Expenses from any and all third-party service providers to
whom payments are required to be made by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and from each holder of the Convertible Notes.
The pay-off letters shall provide that the amounts set forth therein
represent payment in full for all fees and expenses payable by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to all Transaction Expenses. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall disburse to the Persons indicated on the
Allocations Spreadsheet amounts equal to the Transaction Expenses.   7.5
Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Approvals.   (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) In connection with and without limiting Section
7.5(a), each of the Company and its Board of Directors and Parent and its
Board of Directors shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   7.6 Transaction Related
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or other third-party
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   7.7 No Solicitation by the Company;
Etc.    73   (a) The Company shall, and the Company shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the
destruction of all copies of confidential information previously provided to
such parties by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Representatives. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit its Representatives or the Company
Subsidiaries to directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any
inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) other than informing Persons of the existence
of the provisions contained in this Section 7.7, participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover
Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by the Company Subsidiaries or Representatives shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.7 by the Company.   (b) In
addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section
7.7, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, in writing, and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other
contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in
respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such
notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests
(and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written
materials received that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.   7.8
Indemnification; Insurance.   (a) The right to indemnification conferred
upon the officers and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
by such company\'s certificate of incorporation or other organizational
documents as in effect as of the date hereof shall include to the fullest
extent not prohibited by Law the right to be paid by the Company for any
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that if the DGCL or other applicable Law
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in
his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or
officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made   
74  only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of
such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under the certificate of incorporation or other organizational
document of Company or the Company Subsidiary.   (b) Parent will arrange
and pay for a six (6) year run-off director and officer liability insurance
policy, effective as of the Closing, for the benefit of the directors and
officers of the Company prior to the Closing Date. The run-off policy will
provide continuing liability coverage, equivalent as to limits, deductibles
and other features to the current director and officer liability insurance
policy, for claims made against the directors and officers of the Company
prior to the Closing Date during the term of the policy following the Closing
Date for actions taken by or omitted to be taken by them prior to the Closing
Date.   (c) Notwithstanding Section 7.8(b), all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company\'s
certificate of incorporation, the Company\'s bylaws or any written
indemnification agreement between such directors or officers and the Company
(in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), unless otherwise released,
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation (and its successors and
assigns) in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall, following the Closing, continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of indemnified parties, unless such modification is required by
Law.   (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, assume all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 7.8 and if
Surviving Corporation fails to perform such obligations, Parent shall be
responsible for the performance of such obligations.   (e) The provisions
of this Section 7.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and (i) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.8
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as    75  to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section
7.8 without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.8 and if Surviving Corporation
fails to perform such obligations, Parent shall be responsible for the
performance of such obligations.   7.9 Confidentiality. Except for
disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated effective as of November 8, 2006, between Parent and the
Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"), Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold,
all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   7.10
Publicity. None of the Company or Parent shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law, provided that, to
the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending to make
such release shall use its reasonable best efforts consistent with such
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text
thereof.   7.11 Employee Matters.   (a) Subject to Section 7.12, Parent
covenants and agrees that for a period of one year following the Closing, it
will not reduce the salary (rate of wages) of or make an adverse change in
the position held by any of the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries who were employed immediately prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that such employees shall continue their employment on an "at-will"
basis following the Closing.   (b) For a period of one year following the
Closing, or such longer period of time required by applicable Law, Parent
shall cause to be provided to employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries the Company Plans (and Foreign Plans, if applicable) which are
welfare benefit plans or with coverage under other welfare benefit plans
comparable in the aggregate to such Company Plans (and Foreign Plans, if
applicable) immediately prior to the Closing; provided, that for purposes of
eligibility for participation and vesting within such other welfare benefit
plans, employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for all of their service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized under the
corresponding or similar Company Plan (and Foreign Plan, if applicable).  
(c) Parent shall establish an employee retention stock pool (the "IPWIRELESS
STOCK BONUS PLAN") consisting of shares of Parent Common Stock for employees,
officers and consultants of the Company, having an aggregate value of
$7,000,000 at the time of issuance as determined pursuant to the terms of the
IPWireless Stock Bonus Plan, as set forth in Exhibit D.    76   7.12
Employee Agreements. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause Bill Jones, Alan Jones, Malcolm Gordon and Roger Nichol to enter
into the form of the Non-Competition Agreement set forth as Exhibit F. The
Company will not be obligated to offer to any such employee any consideration
as an inducement or consideration to enter into the Non-Competition Agreement
and will not be obligated to terminate the employment of any employee who
declines to execute the Non-Competition Agreement.   7.13 Options. The Board
of Directors of the Company shall make such amendments and adjustments to, or
make such determinations with respect to, the Company Stock Options as are
necessary to implement the provisions of Section 3.1(i). Without limiting the
foregoing, subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, following the Effective Time, the Company will not
be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, warrants or other rights
or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to
receive any payment in respect thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the IPWireless Inc.
1999 Stock Plan, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective
Time.   7.14 Board of Directors.   (a) Parent shall appoint William Jones
to the Board of Directors of Parent on or prior to Closing (the "DESIGNATED
DIRECTOR"). The Designated Director shall be included in the slate of
nominees to be recommended by such Board of Directors to Parent\'s
stockholders for election as a director at each meeting of stockholders of
Parent at which directors of the class of which the Designated Director is a
member are to be elected. In the event that William Jones shall cease to
serve as a director of Parent for any reason, a successor designated by the
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed to the Board of Directors
immediately following such cessation of service. Such successor thereafter
shall be included in the slate of nominees to be recommended by such Board of
Directors to Parent\'s stockholders for election as a director at each
meeting of stockholders of Parent at which directors of the class of which
the Designated Director is a member are to be elected.   (b) The Chief
Executive Officer of Parent or, at such officer\'s designation, William Jones
shall hold quarterly meetings with the Stockholder Representative and such
other representatives of former holders of Preferred Stock of the Company
(not to exceed four individuals) as may be designated by the Stockholder
Representative for purposes of discussing the business of Parent, including
its Subsidiaries that operate the Public Safety Business and the TDtv
Business. Such meetings shall be held during normal business hours at a
location mutually acceptable to the participants. During such meetings,
Parent shall provide to the Stockholder Representative and such former
holders recent income statements and balance sheets for such business as well
as such other information as is reasonably requested by such attendees
for purposes of understanding the results of operations and financial
condition of    77  such business. To the extent that any such
information is non-public, Parent may precondition the provision of such
information on the execution of a customary confidentiality agreement by each
of the attendees.   (c) The provisions of this Section 7.14 shall remain in
full force and effect until, and shall automatically terminate after, payment
of the 2009 Earnout Amount.   7.15 Tax Matters.   (a) Tax Returns. Parent
shall cause to be prepared and filed in a timely manner all Tax Returns
relating to the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that have not been filed on or
before the Closing Date ("PRE-CLOSING TAX RETURN"). Such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner
consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (except to extent the Parent determines there is no
reasonable basis in law therefore or determines that a Tax Return cannot be
so prepared and filed or an item so reported without being subject
to penalties). With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Return, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to review and consent to such
Pre-Closing Tax Returns prior to the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.   (b) Taxable Merger. Unless
otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto shall treat the Merger as a
direct taxable purchase of stock from the stockholders of the Company for
United States federal income tax purposes and the parties hereto shall not
treat the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder for any Tax reporting purposes.
Parent shall not take, and shall omit from taking, and will cause the Company
after the Closing not to take or omit from taking any action that could cause
the Merger to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.   (c) Actions on the Closing Date and Tax Elections. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will take, and the Parent will not
permit either the Company or any Company Subsidiary to take, any action on
the Closing Date after the Closing that could result in any income Tax
Liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date other
than any action taken in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, as the case may be;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude Parent from making a
Section 338(g) election under the Code, and in the event such an election is
made on or after the Closing Date, any Tax Liability arising therefrom shall
not be considered a Loss subject to Indemnification.   (d) Application for
Waiver of Singapore Continuity Requirement. The Company shall cause each
Company Subsidiary that has unabsorbed capital allowances or losses for
Singapore tax purposes to take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
apply for and to use commercially reasonable    78  efforts to obtain a
waiver from the Ministry of Finance in Singapore of the continuity of
ownership requirement provided for in Sec. 23 and Sec. 37(2)(a) of the Income
Tax Act of Singapore, provided, however, that such waiver(s) need not be
obtained prior to Closing.   7.16 Reservation and Listing of Parent Common
Stock. Effective at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve
(free from preemptive rights) out of its reserved but unissued shares of
Parent Common Stock sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to provide for
the issuance by Parent of all shares of Parent Common Stock that may be
issued as a result of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued at the Effective Time to be approved for listing on the
NASDAQ Global Market at or prior to the Effective Time and will take all
action necessary to cause any additional shares of Parent Common Stock to be

IX   INDEMNIFICATION   9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  
(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "EXPIRATION DATE").
Any claim for a Loss asserted in good faith on or prior to the Expiration
Date which sets forth in a written notice in reasonable detail (based   
83  on the facts then available) the nature and estimated scope of such
claim will be timely made for purposes hereof. Any claim for indemnification
with respect to any of such matters, other than with respect to Section 5.12,
that is not asserted by notice to the other party on or prior to the
Expiration Date may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after
such time.   (b) All covenants and agreements made by the parties to
this Agreement which contemplate performance following the Closing Date shall
survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms. All covenants and
agreements that contemplate performance prior to the Closing Date shall not
survive the Closing Date; provided, however, that if any such covenant or
agreement is breached on or prior to the Closing Date, the non-breaching
party shall retain all rights and remedies hereunder with respect to such
breach following the Closing Date.   9.2 Indemnification.   (a) Subject
to the provisions of this Article IX, the Escrow Fund shall be available as
the sole and exclusive remedy to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, and their respective subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, independent contractors, agents and
representatives (the "PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against any and
all Losses (irrespective of whether or not such Losses arise out of or in
connection with a third party claim) to the extent, but only to the extent,
relating to, resulting from or arising out of:   (i) any breach of any of
the representations and  warranties made by the Company in Article V of this
Agreement;   (ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement on  the
part of the Company under this Agreement or any other  Company Document,  
(iii) any Tax Losses;   (iv) any penalties paid in cash or in-kind or 
credited by the Company to T-Mobile in connection with  Purchase Orders
placed on the Company by T-Mobile under the  T-Mobile Agreements prior to the
date of this Agreement;   (v) any claims brought by any Company Stockholder
or  other equity holder of the Company\'s capital stock in  connection with
the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated in this Agreement; or  
(vi) any Intellectual Property Payments  such foregoing Losses being
referred to herein as "PARENT INDEMNIFIABLE LOSSES;" provided, however, that,
(x) the Parent Indemnified Parties may not recover any amount for Parent
Indemnifiable Losses arising from the inaccuracies of, or breaches of, the
representations or warranties contained herein unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Parent Indemnifiable Losses exceeds $100,000 (the   
84  "DEDUCTIBLE"), and only with respect to such amounts in excess of
the Deductible, provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply with
respect to any Tax Losses, and (y) the sole recourse for Parent Indemnifiable
Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification shall be to the Escrow Fund; provided further that the Parent
Indemnified Parties may not recover Parent Indemnifiable Losses in excess of
$20,000,000 in the aggregate; provided further, that the IP Escrow shall be
the sole recourse to cover Losses incurred by Parent Indemnified Parties as a
result of Intellectual Property Payments. For purposes of calculating Losses
hereunder, after a breach or claim referred to in Section 9.2(a)(i), (ii) or
(iv) has been established, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall be ignored for such purposes. Notwithstanding any of other provision of
this Agreement, no claim for Parent Indemnifiable Losses may be made after
the Expiration Date.   9.3 Escrow Arrangements.   (a) Escrow Fund. The
Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties
for any claims by such parties for any Losses incurred or sustained by them
and for which they are entitled to recovery under this Article IX.   (b)
Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period. Subject to the
following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence as of the
Closing and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Expiration
Date (the "ESCROW PERIOD") and will be distributed to the
Company Stockholders; provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to 100% of the amount of any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered in good faith to the Escrow
Agent prior to the Expiration Date with respect to facts and circumstances
existing prior to the Expiration Date (each, an "UNRESOLVED CLAIM"). As soon
as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent, on behalf of the applicable Company Stockholders, the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, not required to satisfy such
Unresolved Claims. For the purposes hereof, "OFFICER\'S CERTIFICATE" shall
mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent and delivered to the
Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative: (1) stating that Parent has
paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will
have to pay, incur, sustain or accrue, Losses, (2) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the
date each such item was paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, and (3)
identifying the amount of cash and/or the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be delivered to Parent in compensation for such
Losses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
Indemnifiable Losses do not include, and no Parent Indemnified Party may seek
to recover indemnification or other relief for, consequential damages, lost
profits or exemplary or punitive damages (unless such damages or loss profits
are incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party as a result of a third party
claim). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent
in compensation for any    85  Losses pursuant to this Section 9.3(b)
shall be equal to the quotient of (x) the amount of compensation to be
delivered for the Losses certified in an Officer\'s Certificate minus the
amount of cash to be delivered for such Losses, divided by (y) the then
Average Parent Stock Price.   (c) Claims for Indemnification. Upon receipt
by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the Expiration Date of an
Officer\'s Certificate, the Escrow Agent, subject to the provisions of
Section 9.3(d), shall deliver to Parent, as promptly as practicable, an
amount of cash, number of shares of Parent Common Stock or combination of the
foregoing as determined by the Stockholder Representative, from the Escrow
Fund equal to the amount of Losses set forth in such Officer\'s Certificate;
provided, however, that to the extent an Officer\'s Certificate alleges only
the basis for anticipated Losses, no amount shall be distributed until such
Losses are actually paid, incurred or sustained. If the Stockholder
Representative does not object in writing within the 30-day period set forth
in Section 9.3(d) after delivery by Parent of the Officer\'s Certificate to
the Stockholder Representative, such failure to so object shall constitute an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Company Stockholders that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officer\'s Certificate;
provided, however, that to the extent an Officer\'s Certificate alleges only
the basis for anticipated Losses, no amount shall be distributed until such
Losses are actually paid, incurred or sustained by a Parent Indemnified Party
(notwithstanding the Stockholder Representative\'s failure to object in
writing).   (d) Objections to Claims against the Escrow Fund. At the
time of delivery of any Officer\'s Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder
Representative, and for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the
Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any portion of the Escrow
Amount pursuant to Section 9.3(c) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received
written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, the Escrow
Agent shall make payment pursuant to Section 9.3(c), provided that no such
payment may be made if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a
written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30)-day period.   (e) Resolution of Conflicts;
Arbitration.   (i) If the Stockholder Representative shall object in 
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer\'s  Certificate to recover
Losses from the Escrow Fund within  thirty (30) days after delivery of such
Officer\'s Certificate,  then the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
attempt  in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective  parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the  Stockholder Representative and
Parent should so agree, a  memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and  signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against
the  Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The    86  
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum  and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with  the terms thereof.  
(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good  faith negotiation and
prior to sixty (60) days after delivery  of an Officer\'s Certificate, either
Parent or the Stockholder  Representative may demand arbitration of the
matter unless the  amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with
a  third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced  until
such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to  arbitration, and in
either such event the matter shall be  settled by arbitration conducted by
one arbitrator mutually  agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. In the  event that, within thirty (30) days after submission
of any  dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder  Representative
cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then,  within fifteen (15) days
after the end of such thirty (30)-day  period, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall each  select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so
selected shall  select a third arbitrator. If one party but not the other 
fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15)-day  period, then the
parties agree that the arbitration will be  conducted by the one arbitrator
selected by the party which  has made such a selection.   (iii) Any such
arbitration shall be held in San  Francisco, California, under the rules and
procedures then in  effect of the American Arbitration Association. The 
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the  arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses  of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the  administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association.  The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set
a  limited time period and establish procedures designed to  reduce the cost
and time for discovery while allowing the  parties an opportunity, adequate
in the sole judgment of the  arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case  may be, to discover relevant information from the
opposing  parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The  arbitrator,
or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the  case may be, shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit  discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions,  including attorneys\' fees and costs, to the same extent as a 
competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a  majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be,  determine that discovery was
sought without substantial  justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to  without substantial justification. The decision of the 
arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case  may be, as to
the validity and amount of any claim in such  Officer\'s Certificate shall be
final, binding, and conclusive  upon the parties to this Agreement. Such
decision shall be  written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and  conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree  or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent  shall be entitled to rely
on, and make distributions from the  Escrow Fund in accordance with, the
terms of such award,  judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within ten
(10) days  of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one 
party to another, such party shall make the payment to such  other party.  
87   (iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the  arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The foregoing arbitration
provision shall apply to, and shall  be the exclusive remedy for, any dispute
between the  Stockholder Representative and the Parent Indemnified Party 
under this Article IX, whether relating to claims upon the  Escrow Fund or to
the other indemnification obligations set  forth in this Article IX.   (f)
Third-Party Claims.   (i) In the event Parent becomes aware of a  third-
party claim which Parent reasonably believes may result  in a demand against
the Escrow Fund, Parent shall promptly  thereafter notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of  such claim. The Stockholder Representative
shall have the  right to elect to assume the defense of such claim unless
(x)  the Losses arising from such claim may reasonably be expected  to
exceed the Escrow Amount (with the shares of Parent Common  Stock then held
in escrow being valued, on a per share basis,  at the then Average Parent
Stock Price), (based solely on the  damages alleged by the third party, if
any damages are  alleged) or (y) the claim seeks relief which would limit
or  otherwise adversely affect the conduct of business by the  Surviving
Corporation. Failure by the Stockholder  Representative to notify Parent of
its election to assume the  defense of any such claim or litigation by a
third party  within twenty-five (25) days after notice thereof has been 
given to the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed a  waiver by the
Stockholder Representative of its right to  assume the defense of such claim
or litigation, and the Parent  shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, without  prejudice to its right of indemnification under this 
Agreement. All claims for legal fees and expenses or other  Losses against
the Escrow Fund for which Parent is entitled to  indemnification pursuant to
this Section 9.3(f) shall be  subject to, and shall be exclusively resolved
through, the  claims processing and dispute procedures set forth in this 
Section 9.3.   (ii) The Stockholder Representative, if it is  entitled to
and does assume the defense, shall retain counsel  reasonably satisfactory to
Parent to defend such claim and  shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
counsel with  regard thereto. If the Stockholder Representative elects to 
assume the defense, the obligations under Article IX of this  Agreement shall
include taking all steps that the Stockholder  Representative deems
reasonably necessary in the  investigation, defense or settlement of such
claim or  litigation (including the retention of legal counsel);  provided,
however, that (x) the Stockholder Representative  shall first consult with
Parent regarding such settlement, (y)  no settlement may be made by the
Stockholder Representative  without the consent in writing of Parent, which
shall not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such settlement (i) 
releases Parent from any liability in respect thereof, (ii)  does not include
any admission of culpability on the part of  Parent and (iii) does not impose
an injunction or other  equitable relief upon Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the  Company Subsidiaries or otherwise impose affirmative or 
negative covenants on Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the  Company
Subsidiaries and (z) the Stockholder Representative  shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to Taxes  without Parent\'s consent, which shall not
be unreasonably    88   withheld or delayed. If the Stockholder
Representative elects  to assume the defense, the Stockholder Representative
shall  permit Parent to participate in such defense or settlement  through
separate counsel chosen by Parent, with the fees and  expenses of such
separate counsel borne by Parent; provided,  however, that in the event
Parent shall conclude (upon the  advice of counsel) that there may be legal
defenses or rights  available to it which are different from, in actual
conflict  with, or additional to those available to the Stockholder 
Representative, Parent shall be entitled to select separate  counsel to act
on its behalf and the Stockholder  Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay the  reasonable separate counsel fees and other reasonable
expenses  related thereto from the Escrow Fund. Any Losses caused by or 
arising out of any settlement or any Order respecting any  third party claim
shall be satisfied exclusively by a Parent  claim against the Escrow Fund and
Parent shall be solely  responsible for any such amount in excess of the
then  available Escrow Fund. In the event that the Stockholder 
Representative has consented in writing to any settlement, the  Company
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to  object under any provision
of this Article IX to any claim for  an amount less than or equal to the
amount of such settlement  by Parent against the Escrow Fund with respect to
such  settlement.   (iii) Parent, if Parent is entitled to and does 
assume the defense, shall retain counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the
Stockholder Representative to defend such  claim and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel  with regard thereto. If Parent elects to
assume the defense,  the obligations under Article IX of this Agreement
shall  include taking all steps Parent deems reasonably necessary in  the
investigation, defense or settlement of such claim or  litigation (including
the retention of legal counsel) and  holding the Stockholder Representative
harmless from and  against any and all Losses caused by or arising out of
any  settlement approved by the Parent or any judgment in  connection with
such claim or litigation; provided, however,  that Parent shall first consult
with the Stockholder  Representative regarding such settlement. If Parent
elects to  assume the defense of such third-party claim or litigation, 
Parent shall permit the Stockholder Representative to  participate in such
defense or settlement through separate  counsel chosen by the Stockholder
Representative, with the  fees and expenses of such separate counsel borne by
such the  Stockholder Representative; provided, however, that in the  event
the Stockholder Representative shall conclude (upon the  advice of counsel)
that there may be legal defenses or rights  available to it which are
different from, in actual conflict  with, or additional to those available to
Parent, the  Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to select 
separate counsel to act on its behalf and the Stockholder  Representative
shall pay the reasonable separate counsel fees  and other reasonable expenses
related thereto and, such fees  and expenses will be paid from the Escrow
Fund.   (g) The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt
notice of any indemnification claim shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect the indemnifying party\'s obligations with respect thereto
except to the    89  extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate
actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.   9.4 Exclusive
Remedy. From and after the Effective Time, resort to indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX and the Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Parent Indemnified Parties for any Loss arising out of or related
to any breach of, or dispute or claim relating to, this Agreement or to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matter that is otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder if the Merger contemplated hereby is consummated or
that constitutes a claim or cause of action against any Company Stockholder.
Except for claims for equitable relief and claims with respect to fraud
solely against the Person or Persons committing or alleged to have committed
such fraud, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any breach of, or dispute or
claim relating to, any provision of this Agreement or any matter that
is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if the Merger contemplated hereby
is consummated or that constitutes a claim or cause of action against any
Company Stockholder.   9.5 Tax Losses.   (a) For purposes of this
Agreement, "TAX LOSSES" means any and all Losses attributable to Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including the portion of any Straddle Period
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period).   (b) For purposes of
allocating income, gain, deductions and losses attributable to the period up
to and including the Effective Time for a Straddle Period, (i) real, personal
and intangible property Taxes shall be allocated on a per diem basis, (ii)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, will be apportioned ratably between
such periods on a per diem basis and (iii) other Taxes (including income
taxes and taxes in lieu of income taxes to the extent not governed by clause
(ii)), shall be allocated based on a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (including, without limitation, a closing of the
books on the Closing Date for purposes of allocating income, gain, deductions
and losses attributable to the Company).   9.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity
Payments. The Company and Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
Payments for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes unless a
contrary treatment is required under applicable Law.   90   ARTICLE X  
MISCELLANEOUS   10.1 Stockholder Representative.   (a) J. Taylor Crandall
(the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE") is hereby appointed as the Stockholder
Representative hereunder to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to any Parent Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims and Losses by a Parent Indemnified Party, to object to
such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims or Losses, to receive payments on
behalf of the Company Stockholders due and owing pursuant to this Agreement
and acknowledge receipt thereof, to waive any breach or default of Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement following the Effective Time, to calculate
the Allocations Spreadsheet, to receive service of process on behalf of the
Company Stockholders in connection with any claims under this Agreement or
any related document or instrument, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that
such agency shall apply only to matters affecting all or most of the Company
Stockholders and any matter that affects only an individual Company
Stockholder shall be addressed by Parent and such Company Stockholder. Such
agency may be changed by the Company Stockholders from time to time upon not
less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however,
that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and
the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Company Stockholders.   (b) Except
for intentional fraud, the Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to
the following sentence, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company Stockholders shall be, severally based on such Company
Stockholder\'s [Pro Rata Portion] of the Merger Consideration and not
jointly, obligated to indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
the Stockholder Representative. At the time of distribution pursuant to
Section 9.3(c) to the Company Stockholders of any proceeds remaining in
the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from such income and gains included in such distribution to pay
and    91  reimburse fees and expenses of third parties incurred or
expected to be incurred in connection with its role as Stockholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement.   (c) The grant of authority
provided for in this Section 10.1 is coupled with an interest and is being
granted, in part, as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (i) shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of the Company or
any Company Stockholder shall be binding on any successor thereto and (ii)
shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company Stockholder of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.   (d)
In connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder and under the
Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to select and engage, at the cost and expense of
the Company Stockholders (as contemplated by Section 10.1(b)), attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel
and obtain such other professional and expert assistance, and maintain such
records, as the Stockholder Representative may deem necessary or desirable
and incur other out-of-pocket expenses related to performing its services
hereunder. For purposes of enabling the Stockholder Representative
to exercise his rights and discharge his obligations hereunder and only to
such extent, including responding to any claim for indemnification or offset
provided by Article IX, from the Effective Time until all Earnout Amounts
have been paid (or are no longer payable) and any outstanding Parent
Indemnifiable Losses have been satisfied, upon the reasonable request of the
Stockholder Representative (upon reasonable advance notice and during normal
working hours), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
Stockholder Representative reasonable access during normal working hours to
the Surviving Corporation\'s and Parent\'s properties, books, contracts,
records and information (including outside auditor work papers) relating to
the business of the Surviving Corporation (whether on by the Surviving
Corporation or another entity under Parent\'s control) and (ii) make
available to, and cause to cooperate, all officers, accountants, counsel and
other representatives or agents of such business. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information in such a manner as would
(A) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the entity in possession or
control of such information or (B) contravene any Law or Order.   (e) In
dealing with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any instruments,
agreements or documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to
exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the
Stockholder Representative hereunder or thereunder, (i) the Stockholder
Representative and its agents, counsel, accountants and other representatives
shall not assume any, and shall incur no, responsibility whatsoever (in each
case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to the Company Stockholders,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation by reason of any error in judgment or
other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with
this Agreement,    92  the Escrow Agreement or any such other agreement,
instrument or document other than with respect to intentional fraud of the
Stockholder Representative, and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of counsel, public accountants
or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any
error in judgment or other act or omission of the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Stockholder
Representative to liability to the Company Stockholders, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.   (f) All of the immunities and powers granted to
the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.   (g) A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including an extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Article IV or
Section 10.6, as applicable, shall constitute a decision of the Company
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Company Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Company Stockholders. The Escrow Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative.   (h) The Stockholder
Representative has all requisite power, authority and legal capacity to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each other agreement, document, or
instrument or certificate contemplated by this Agreement to be executed by
the Stockholder Representative in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with this Agreement,
the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE DOCUMENTS"), and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each of the Stockholder Representative Documents by the
Stockholder Representative, the performance of its respective
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all required
action on the part of the Stockholder Representative. This Agreement has
been, and each of the Stockholder Representative Documents will be at or
prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Stockholder Representative and (assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes,
and each of the Stockholder Representative Documents when so executed and
delivered will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Stockholder Representative enforceable against it in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and
remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity).   93   10.2 Specific Performance. The Company and
Parent acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Agreement by the other
party would cause irreparable damage to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, and that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will not have an
adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of the Company and the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree
of specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and
shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party may have under
this Agreement or otherwise.   10.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to
Service of Process.   (a) Except for matters governed by Section 9.3(e),
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any federal or state court located within the State of Delaware over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding
related thereto shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute.   (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit,
action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.7.   10.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and performed in such state without
reference to any conflict of law principle.   10.5 Entire Agreement; No
Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
(a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement and (b)
except for the provisions of Sections 7.8 and Article IX, are not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies.   10.6 Amendment and Waivers. This Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or changed by the parties hereto; provided, however,
that there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval
by the Company Stockholders without such approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.
The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed    94  as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
4.1 or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall, in order to
be effective, require, in the case of Parent or the Company, action by its
Board of Directors. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.   10.7 Notices. All
notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written
confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one business day following the day
sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each
case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other

Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  
10.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of
the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion,
any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve
Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   10.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
