corporation (the " _Company_ "), InBev N.V./S.A., a public company organized
under the laws of Belgium (" _Parent_ "), and Pestalozzi Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
," the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best
interests of the Companys stockholders and has resolved to recommend the

and in order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parents
controlling shareholder Stichting InBev AK (the " _Stichting_ "), has
delivered to the Company, a letter agreement (the " _Parent Shareholder
Commitment_ ") addressed to the board of directors of the Company with
respect to certain commitments made by such shareholder in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
this Agreement; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

_ARTICLE I_

_The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ").

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the third business day (the "
_Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Time) other
than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized
to close in New York, New York or London, England.

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

_ARTICLE II_

_Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. As of the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ")
shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in Annex B which Parent
shall provide to the Company prior to the Closing and which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, until thereafter amended (subject to
Section 6.12(b)) as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

 

-2- 2.2. _The By-Laws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "),
until thereafter amended (subject to Section 6.12(b)) as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

_ARTICLE III_

_Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws.

3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
By-Laws.

_ARTICLE IV_

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders ("
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each of the Shares
described in clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Excluded Share_ " and, collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $70.00
in cash per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the  



 

-3-  Shares or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(f), except for Excluded Shares owned
by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties,
which shall remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a)  _Paying Agent_. Simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient for the
Paying Agent to make payments (i) under Section 4.1(a) and (ii) in respect of
Company Options pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and Company Awards pursuant to
Section 4.3(b) (such aggregate cash amount in clauses (i) and (ii) being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned
to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within (x) five business days in the case of record holders and (y) three
business days in the case of the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") on
behalf of "street" holders), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail (or in the case of DTC, deliver) to each holder of record of
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be  



 

-4-  effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section
4.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon
due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for nine (9) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or Book-
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.  



 

-5-  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it reasonably determines in good faith it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state,
local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.



 

-6- 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)(i)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later
than three (3) business days) after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(b) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans and any other Company Benefit Plans (as defined in Section
5.1(h)(i)), other than Company Options (the " _Company Awards_ "), vested or
unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon
as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than three (3) business
days) after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time
times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award
provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified
reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger
Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(c) _Termination of Plan_. The Companys Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan
shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and no new share
offering date shall commence after the date hereof. Any amounts withheld and
contributed to a savings account on behalf of a participating employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and held in such savings account immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be refunded to such participating employee as soon
as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than three (3) business
days). 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company or the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c). The Company shall take all reasonable
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Options or Company Awards or otherwise.

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a  



 

-7-  reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted.

_ARTICLE V_

_Representations and Warranties_

5.1.  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports (as defined in Section 5.1(e)(i)) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") prior to the date of
this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any
risk factor section or in any other section to the extent they are forward
looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or
in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure schedule
delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the
" _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so delivered is in full force and effect.

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities
or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries; (ii) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " is as
defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "); (iii) "
_Joint Venture_ " means Tsingtao Brewery Company, Ltd.; and (iv) " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
business or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole; _provided_ , that none of the following, in and of itself or
themselves, shall constitute (or be taken into account in determining the
occurrence of) a Material Adverse Effect:

(A) effects resulting from changes in the economy or financial, credit,
banking, currency, commodities or capital markets generally in the United
States or other countries in which the Company conducts material operations
or any changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, monetary policy or
inflation;



 

-8- (B) effects resulting from changes that are the result of factors generally
affecting the beer, packaging or theme park industries;

(C) effects resulting from changes in Law or in United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or rules and policies of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;

(D) any act of God or other calamity, national or international, political or
social conditions (including the engagement by any country in hostilities,
whether commenced before or after the date hereof, and whether or not pursuant
to the declaration of a national emergency or war), or the occurrence of any
military or terrorist attack;

(E) effects resulting from any failure by the Company to meet any estimates
of revenues or earnings on or after the date of this Agreement, _provided_
that the exception in this clause (E) shall not prevent or otherwise affect
any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such failure from
being taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred;

(F) (i) the announcement or the existence of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any related or resulting loss of
or change in relationship with any customer, supplier, distributor, wholesaler
or other business partner, or departure of any employee or officer, or any
litigation or other proceeding), including by reason of the identity of Parent
or any plans or intentions of Parent with respect to the conduct of the
business of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) compliance with
the terms of, or any actions taken pursuant to, this Agreement, or any
failures to take action which is prohibited by this Agreement, or such other
changes or events to which Parent has expressly consented in writing; or

(G) any item or items set forth in Section 5.1(a)(G) of the Company Disclosure
Letter; 

_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D),
any effects resulting from any change, event, circumstance or development
that disproportionately adversely affects the Company and its Subsidiaries
compared to other companies  



 

-9-  operating in the beer, packaging or theme park industries, as the case may
be, shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred, but only to the extent of such disproportionate

leasehold interest in, all their respective domestic properties and assets
(excluding Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property and Intellectual Property

good faith and duly and, in cases where the statute of limitations would still
be open, timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which

all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and all
such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects;
(ii) have paid all Taxes (as defined below) that are shown as due on such

there are not pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, any
audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes
or Tax matters. There are not, to the knowledge of the Company, any unresolved

liability that are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect and are not disclosed or provided for in the

determined to be a "listed transaction" for purposes of 1.6011-4(b)(2)).
Neither the Company nor any of Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction of
which it made disclosure to any taxing authority to avoid penalties under
Section 6662(d) of the Code or any comparable provision of state, foreign or

other agreements with a labor union, works council or labor organization to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which any of them
are otherwise bound pertaining to certain Employees in the United States
(collectively, the " _Company Labor Agreements_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, except as would not, or would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is the subject of any
proceeding that asserts that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice (nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is
there a basis for any such claim), nor is there pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened, nor has there been, since January 1, 2007, any
labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, labor picketing, lockout or
material slowdown involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as
would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, individually  



 

-23-  or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not entitle any third party (including any labor union or labor organization)
to any payments under any Company Labor Agreements. Except as would not, or
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in
all respects with the reporting requirements of the Labor Management Reporting

and applications included in the Company IP owned by, and to the knowledge of

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, (A) neither the conduct
of the business of the Company and/or the conduct of the business of each of
its Subsidiaries nor the Company IP infringes, dilutes, misappropriates or
otherwise violates any Intellectual Property rights of any third party; and
(B) to the knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing, diluting,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company IP owned or exclusively
licensed by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

discovered by any Person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-
disclosure and/or license agreements or pursuant to obligations to
maintain confidentiality arising by operation of law.

(iv) Except in any such case as is not, individually or in the

item in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), Parent hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or
in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has
made available to the Company complete and correct copies of Parents articles
of incorporation and Merger Subs certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in

InBev Worldwide S.a.r.l., a limited liability company organized under the

is necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to approval of
the Merger (in accordance with Section 23 of Parents by-laws) and certain
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by 75% (or 50% with

been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and is a
valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each
of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. At or prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true and correct copy of
the Parent Shareholder Commitment.

conjunction with the Parent Prospectus or the Equity Financing (collectively,
the " _Equity Financing Filings_ "), the filings and/or notices pursuant to
Section 1.3, under the Exchange Act and the HSR Act and any notices to,
approvals of, or consents or clearances by, any other Governmental Antitrust
Entity (the " _Parent Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or
obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent
or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result
in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub or the comparable governing
instruments of any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a material breach or violation of, assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.2(c)(i), any Law to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, a breach or violation of, a termination, cancellation or modification
(or right of termination, cancellation or modification) or default under, the
payment of additional fees, the creation or acceleration of any obligations
under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in the case of clause (C) for any such breach,
violation, termination, default, creation or acceleration that would  



 

-27-  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) _Available Funds_.

(i) Parent and Merger Sub have available or will have available to them, as of
the date all of the conditions to Parents obligation to close pursuant to

the Senior Lenders, the " _Lenders_ "), and all annexes, schedules and
appendixes containing any funding conditions to the funding under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Bridge Facility, pursuant to which Facilities the
Lenders have agreed to lend the amounts contemplated by the Facilities for the
purpose of, among other things, consummating the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Financing_ "). Each of
the Facilities is in full force and effect, and has not been withdrawn or
terminated and to Parents knowledge, is enforceable against the Lenders
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
Parent will not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of
the Lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement or the Bridge Facility
Agreement, except for assignments and replacements of an individual Lender

There are no conditions precedent related to the funding under the Facilities,
except those expressly set forth in the Senior  



 

-28-  Facilities Agreement or the Bridge Facilities Agreement. As of the date of

provisions of any Judgment of any Governmental Entity which is, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair the

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);



 

-34- (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Company
has otherwise complied in all material respects with this Section 6.2, the
Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a
Person (other than any Affiliate of the Company) who has made an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors believes in
good faith to be bona fide providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of
the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not
more favorable to such other Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); and promptly discloses
(and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the
extent not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of the type described in clause (A)
above; or (C) after having complied with Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend,
or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal; (x) in each
such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of
the Company has determined in good faith based on the information then
available and (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal; and (y) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(b)  _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person, or
proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in any Person becoming
the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity
securities of the Company or those of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or
15% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity securities of
its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

-35- " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal in connection
with which there has been no material violation of this Section 6.2 that
would result in any Person (or its stockholders) becoming the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a
consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company that the board of directors of the Company has
determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.2(c)).

(c) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board
of directors shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a))
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Superior Proposal not knowingly solicited, entered into or agreed to
in breach of this Section 6.2 and made after the date of this Agreement, if
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _Change
of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Change of
Recommendation may be made until after at least 72 hours following Parents
receipt of notice from the Company advising that management of the Company
currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take such
action and the basis therefor, including all required information under
Section 6.2(f). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information provided by Parent. Any material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this Section 6.2.



 

-36- (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure
includes a Change of Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4 (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only
the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed a Change of
Company Recommendation or be deemed to have the substantive effort of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation).

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 6.2(e) of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.2 and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement on
or after January 1, 2007, in connection with such Persons consideration of
acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis (which
shall be considered in light of the circumstances of such proposal or offer
and the time by which Parent has the opportunity to respond), of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto).

6.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in
preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section
6.4(a)) (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The  



 

-37-  Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement
will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and (ii) none of
the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to the information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
that is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement and (ii)
the Company represents and warrants with respect to any projected financial
information provided by it or on its behalf, only that the information was
prepared or approved in good faith by the Companys management on the basis of
assumptions believed by the Companys management to be reasonable as of the
time made. Parent agrees that none of the information supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Parent agrees that none of the information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any written material to be furnished to
shareholders of Parent in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting
(the " _Parent Shareholder Meeting Materials_ ") or any prospectus that Parent
would subsequently prepare and file in connection with the Equity Financing
(the " _Parent Prospectus_ ") will, at the date of being put at the disposal
of shareholders or investors, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation or warranty with respect to the information supplied
by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives that is
contained or incorporated by reference in the Parent Shareholder Meeting
Materials or the Parent Prospectus. The Company agrees that none of the
information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Parent Shareholder Meeting Materials or the Parent Prospectus will, at the
date of being put at the disposal of shareholders or investors, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of  



 

-38-  holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement to consider and vote upon
the adoption of this Agreement, and shall not postpone or adjourn such meeting
except to the extent required by Law. Subject to Section 6.2(c) hereof, the
board of directors of the Company shall recommend such adoption and shall take
all lawful action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement. In the event
that subsequent to the date hereof, the board of directors of the Company
determines that this Agreement is no longer advisable and makes a Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the
holders of the Shares for adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the
Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of
association and by-laws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders at which a vote shall be taken (the " _Parent Shareholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement
to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger and certain other
matters contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not postpone or adjourn
such meeting except to the extent required by Law. The board of directors of
Parent shall recommend such approval and shall take all lawful action to
solicit such approval of the Merger. To the extent permitted under applicable
Law, Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain the approval of the Merger by
its shareholders.

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of
the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the
Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as
possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments
thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any  



 

-39-  Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5(b), shall require, or
be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate,
or actually to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to
consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or
other encumberment by the Company of any of its assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by
the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to any material
changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or
other impairment of, Parents ability to own or operate any of such
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests
therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise
exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving
Corporation (any of the foregoing, " _Detriments_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that in order to ensure that Governmental Antitrust Entities with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Merger do so by the Termination Date, Parent shall agree to one or more
Detriments provided that such Detriments would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a reduction of assets, categories of assets, businesses
or investments that generated in the aggregate more than 5% of the sum of the
2007 gross sales and investment income of Parent and the Company, including
their respective Subsidiaries, on a combined basis net of any ongoing annual
royalty payments or other ongoing revenue contributions expected to be
received as a result of effectuating such Detriments (" _Detriments Limit_ ").
If Governmental Antitrust Entities require that Parent agree to Detriments
that would in the aggregate exceed the Detriment Limit and if, as a result,
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted or
threatened to be instituted by one or more Governmental Antitrust Entities
challenging the Merger as violative of law, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts
to cooperate and to contest and resist, except insofar as Parent and the
Company otherwise may agree, one or more of such actions or proceedings;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent in its sole discretion may decide which
actions or proceedings to contest, if such selected actions or proceedings, if
successfully contested, in the aggregate would result in the Detriments not
exceeding the Detriments Limit. The Company and Parent will each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section
6.5(b), each of the Company and Parent agree to promptly provide to each and
every Governmental Antitrust Entity non-privileged information and documents
(i) requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or (ii) that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters
with any Governmental Antitrust Entity, provided that it shall keep the
Company informed and shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein.  



 

-40-  The Company shall not initiate any meeting or discussion with, or make any
submission to, any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to any
filings, applications, litigation, investigation, or other inquiry or
proceeding regarding the Merger or filings under any pre-merger notification
rules or in connection with any actual or threatened claim or proceeding
unless Parent has approved in advance such initiation and the circumstances
of such meeting, discussion or the content and submission of any such filing.
The Company shall not participate in any meeting or discussion initiated by
any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to any filings, applications,
investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or filings under any pre-
merger notification rules, without giving Parent reasonable prior notice of
the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Antitrust Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate. In addition, the Company shall not initiate any offer to any
Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to any proposed Detriment. Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that the right to review shall not
include any documents created in the ordinary course of business that are
submitted to such Governmental Entity and each of Parent and the Company may
limit access to work product and privileged materials to outside counsel and
agreed upon inside counsel for Parent and the Company. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. If any Detriment agreed to by Parent requires action
by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their
businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this
Agreement, Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the
Company and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

(c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement, the Parent Prospectus, the Parent Shareholders Meeting Materials
or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent of  



 

-41-  any change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to
Parents obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to
prevent or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or of any failure of any condition to the Companys
obligations to effect the Merger.

(e) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.5, each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly provide
to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental
Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or
competition Laws (" _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") non-privileged
information and documents (i) requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity
or (ii) that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose
any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed
to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(as defined in Section 9.7).

6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules
and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.



 

-42- 6.8. _Publicity_.

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release. After the initial press release, the Company and Parent each shall,
to the extent feasible, consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making
any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including
any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with
respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company may (i)
make or cause to be made any press release or similar public announcement or
communication as may be required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Laws or the rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon which
the securities of one of the parties is listed and (ii) disclose any
information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby which it deems
appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a publicly
owned company, including to securities analysts, institutional investors, in
press interviews and to employees; _provided_ , that, to the extent
practicable, Parent and the Company will try in good faith to remain within
the bounds of the parties prior disclosures; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above to the extent in the good faith
judgment of such party it is reasonably practicable to do so), such party (x)
provides the other party with a reasonable opportunity in light of the
circumstances to review such partys intended communication and (y) consider
in good faith modifications to the intended communication that are requested
by the other party.

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent acknowledges that approval of this Agreement by stockholders of
the Company or consummation of the Merger, as applicable, shall constitute a
"change in control" for purposes of all applicable Company Benefit Plans.

(b) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the later of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Time and
(ii) December 31, 2009, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will
continue to be provided with compensation and employee benefits (under
compensation and employee benefit plans) which are not less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
employees as of immediately prior to the date hereof. Parent shall cause any
compensation and employee benefit plans which the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in to credit, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting thereunder (but not for purposes of benefit accrual),
service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service
were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall (1) be treated  



 

-43-  as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (2) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (3) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor the terms of
all Company Benefit Plans existing as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 6.9(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
for non-union employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
are involuntarily terminated without cause during the period beginning on the
Effective Time and ending on the later of (x) one year from the Effective Time
and (y) December 31, 2009, other than those employees who are given a notice
of termination prior to the Effective Time. Following the Closing, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay severance benefits under
such circumstances and in such amounts to such employees that are not less
favorable than the severance benefits payable under the Companys Severance
Pay Program as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes
of the foregoing, an employee who elects to terminate employment pursuant to
an early retirement incentive program shall not be deemed to have been
involuntarily terminated without cause.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay the annual bonuses
for the 2008 calendar year to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who (1) remain employed through December 31, 2008 or (2) are involuntarily
terminated without cause, between the Effective Time and December 31, 2008
(other than employees who are given a notice of termination prior to the
Effective Time). Such bonuses shall be determined as follows: (i) the formula
portion shall be payable based on the performance for the 2008 year in
accordance with the Companys practices and policies in effect on the date
hereof (including the Companys practice with respect to applying the formula)
and (ii) the discretionary portion shall be payable at not less than the
target rate for the particular employee. The aggregate bonus shall be
payable in accordance with Company practice (reduced by the portion which,
pursuant to the applicable Company Benefit Plans, is paid on the change in
control and any other portion that is paid prior to the Effective Time). For
purposes of the foregoing, an employee who elects to terminate employment
pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall not be deemed to have
been involuntarily terminated without case.

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to: (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to employees of the
Company and its  



 

-44-  Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent that provides health benefits in which Company Employees
may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date, other than any
limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the
Effective Time under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents under the
health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Effective Time in
satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health
plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to
an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her eligible
dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(g) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall
honor the terms of all Company Labor Agreements existing as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the Company Labor Agreements set forth
on Section 6.9(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

6.10. _Debt and Equity Financing_.

(a) Parent shall satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent under the Facilities and shall obtain and consummate the financing
contemplated by the Facilities on the Financing Date or, if such financing is
unavailable, obtain and consummate alternative financing. Parent shall give
the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any termination of the
Facilities other than expiry in accordance with their terms on March 20, 2009
and of the occurrence of any event or circumstance that would prevent Parent
from satisfying one or more of the conditions to initial utilization in either
of the Facilities. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes any portion of the financing of the Facilities
unavailable prior to the Termination Date on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Facilities, Parent shall secure as promptly as practicable any
such unavailable portion from alternative sources.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Parent and its Representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours, to Parents books and records, personnel and
auditors and shall provide (and shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to
cause its Representatives to provide) to Parent and Merger Sub, the following
cooperation, as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Facilities and any equity or equity-linked financings required hereunder ("
_Equity Financings_ ") (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the on-going operations of the Company and its  



 

-45-  Subsidiaries), (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to make its
personnel reasonably available for participation in meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence
sessions) and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Parent with all information within the Companys
possession as is reasonably requested by Parent for the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection therewith (including preparation of combined
financial information on a pro forma basis); (iii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Parent with all information within the Companys
possession as is reasonably requested by Parent for preparation of additional
definitive financing documents, and consider in good faith Parents reasonable
requests for certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably
required under the Facilities or in connection with the Equity Financing (it
being understood that the failure of the Company to provide any such
certificate, legal opinion or document will not constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the Company); (iv) furnishing Parent and its lenders or the
underwriters of the Equity Financing with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses that is
within the Companys possession as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(including providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) and
in the form that the Company customarily prepares such financial statements
within the time such statements are customarily prepared); (v) using
commercially reasonable efforts to enable Parent to obtain accountants
comfort letters, as reasonably requested by Parent (whether addressed to the
underwriters of the Equity Financing and/or Parent) (it being understood that
the failure of the Companys accountants to agree to provide such comfort
letters or the failure to provide such comfort letters will not constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the Company, in each case so long as the Company
has used such commercially reasonable efforts); and (vi) using commercially
reasonable efforts to permit the lenders under the Facilities or the
underwriters of the Equity Financing, as well as Parent to evaluate the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures associated therewith. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or Section 6.10(b) shall
require any cooperation or assistance by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives with respect to any action set forth in
this Section 6.10(b) to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable
judgment, interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would require any action of the Board
of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Closing is
not conditioned on the availability of the funding under the Facilities or any
alternative financing arrangement.

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or
incur any liability to any Person under, the Facilities or any financing that
Parent may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that Parent  



 

-46-  and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates
and its Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than, in the case of the Company, to the extent that any such matters arise
from a knowing and material breach of the Companys obligations under this
Section 6.10(b)). Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket third party costs
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.10.

6.11. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 6.10 and Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

6.12. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
fiduciary under any Company Plan (in each case, when acting in such
capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Plan, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to
any acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent that the Company would
have been permitted under Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or
by-laws (and, to the extent not contrary to Delaware law or its certificate
of incorporation, any indemnification agreement) in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall also promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law or its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (and, to the extent not contrary to Delaware law or
its certificate of incorporation, any indemnification agreement) in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Delaware law of the Companys certification of incorporation or by-laws, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or
directors conduct complied with the standards set forth under Delaware law
and the Companys  



 

-47-  certificate of incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party. In the event of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (and in which
indemnification could be sought by Indemnified Parties hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
such matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this Section
6.12 does not purport to limit any rights that any Indemnified Party may have
under any employment agreement, indemnification agreement or Company Plan.

(b) The Charter and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and advancement
of expenses of individuals who were directors and officers prior to the
Effective Time than are set forth, as of the date of this Agreement, in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any such individual.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only for
the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also
include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who,
as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys existing DandO
Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such DandO
Insurance in full force and effect for their full terms. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time for the persons who, as of the date of this
Agreement, are covered by the Companys DandO Insurance in place as of the date
of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such six-year period from
an insurance carrier with the  



 

-48-  same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and with levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in
the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.12.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective successors, heirs and legal representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be amended in any matter that is adverse to the Indemnified Parties
(including their successors, heirs and legal representatives) without the
consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, heirs and legal
representatives) affected thereby.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant all such approvals and take
all such actions as are necessary or advisable so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute, regulation or provision in the Companys certificate of
incorporation or by-laws on such transactions.

6.14.  _Communications_. As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and in compliance with applicable Laws, Parent and the Company

wholesalers and other strategic Persons about this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

voluntarily dismiss, with each party bearing its own costs and
litigation expenses, all actions or proceedings pending between themselves
and their affiliates related in any way to the removal or removability of
directors or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party
shall thereafter sign and deliver all such further papers as may be necessary
in connection with such dismissals. From and after the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall be deemed to have forever released and discharged the other
party from and against all claims or causes of action that were or could have
been asserted against one another in all such actions or proceedings.

(b) Parent hereby withdraws its requests, dated July 8, 2008, that (i) the

representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the
earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent and (y) the Termination Date.

(c) if all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by action taken at the Closing, _provided_  that such conditions
are capable of being satisfied) and Parent or Merger Sub has failed to
consummate the Merger within thirty (30) days after satisfaction of such
conditions.

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the

been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by
the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall
have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that Section 7.2(a)
or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (y) the
Termination Date.

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) Except as provided in
paragraphs (b) or (c) below, in the event of termination of this Agreement and
the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the
part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates);
_provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, that (i) no such termination shall relieve (x) any party hereto of
any liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful
or intentional material breach of this Agreement or (y) Parent or Merger Sub
of any liability or damages to the Company resulting from the failure by
Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing (including a breach of Section
5.2(d) and Section 6.10) and (ii) the provisions set forth in this Section 8.5
and the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

(b) In the event that (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to its stockholders
generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly
announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without
qualification at least (A) thirty (30) business days prior to, with respect to
any termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the date of termination, and (B)
at least ten (10) business days prior to, with respect to termination pursuant
to Section 8.2(b), the date of the Stockholders Meeting) and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.2(a) (Drop Dead) or 8.2(b) (No Stockholder Approval), (ii) this Agreement is
terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4 or (B) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and, on or prior to the date of the Stockholders
Meeting, any event giving rise to Parents right to terminate under Section
8.4 shall have occurred or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (Fiduciary Out), then, in each case, the Company
shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such
termination, pay Parent a termination fee of $1,250,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination Fee to
be paid pursuant to clause (iii)  



 

-55-  shall be paid as set forth in Section 8.3) payable by wire transfer of same
day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Termination Fee shall be payable
to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph (b) unless and until within
12 months of such termination, (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to,
or shall have consummated or shall have approved or recommended to the
Companys stockholders, an Acquisition Proposal or (2) there shall have been
consummated an Acquisition Proposal (substituting in both instances "50%" for
"15%", it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that any series of
related transactions shall be aggregated and considered as a whole in
determining such percentages in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal").
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such
fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate published in the Money
Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.5(b), the Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement. 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.2(c), then, Parent shall promptly, but in no event
later than two days after the date of such termination, pay the Company the
Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds. Parent
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(c) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
suit that results in a judgment against Parent and/or Merger Sub for the fee
set forth in this Section 8.5(c) or any portion of such fee, Parent shall pay
to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge
that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by
Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5(c) (provided that (i) neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has breached any obligation under Section 6.1(c) (but only with
respect to (x) clause (2) of the first sentence thereof and (y) the second
sentence thereof) or Section 6.4(b) of this Agreement and (ii) the Stichting
has not breached any obligation under the Parent Stockholder Commitment), then
the Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages under this Agreement.

not survive the consummation of the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement. 

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the applicable
Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify
or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES  



 

-57-  THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

(c) (i) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, except where this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Section 6.10) and any
other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith and this right
shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to seek
to enforce the terms of the Facilities against the Lenders to the fullest
extent permissible pursuant to such Facilities and applicable Laws and to
thereafter cause the Merger to be consummated, in each case, if the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived
(other than conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
Closing). Any action or proceeding for any such remedy shall be brought
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each party waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy, it being acknowledged that the rights of the Parent and Merger
Sub against the Lenders are governed by the Facilities and English Law.
The parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 9.5(c), a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section
9.5(c) are not available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing
contained in this Section 9.5(c) shall require any party to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.5(c) before exercising any
termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such
termination) nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section
9.5(c) or anything contained in this Section 9.5(c) restrict or limit any
partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

(ii) Each of the parties hereto (A) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding  



 

-58-  relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, in accordance with Section 9.6 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law, of copies of such process to such party,

serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (B) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its property in any action or
proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (C) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (D) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought, tried and determined only in

declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), (E) waives any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (F) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding in such court as provided above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

(iii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably appoint the persons
listed under Sullivan and Cromwell LLP in Section 9.6 as agent for service of
process, to receive on behalf of such party service of copies of the summons
and complaint and any other process which may be served in any action or

this Agreement (whether or not the Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Article VIII), which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub; and (c) the right of the Indemnified Parties to enforce
the provisions of Section 6.12 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers

Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not

provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the

herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the

deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." A reference in this
Agreement to $ or dollars is to U.S. dollars.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Subject to the introductory language to Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, each
party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure schedule in a section of such disclosure schedule that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure schedule to this
Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item is
material, that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect or
that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.



 

-62- 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation and, as applicable pursuant to Section 7.3(a),
as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that any such designation shall not
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
