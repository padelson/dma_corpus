                                    THE OFFER

      SECTION 2.01 The Offer.

            (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 9.01 and that none of the events set forth in Annex A
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall commence the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten Business
Days) after the date hereof. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the condition (the

                                       12

<PAGE>

"Minimum Condition") that at least the number of Shares that shall constitute a
majority of the then outstanding Shares on an as-if-converted basis (including,
without limitation, all Shares issuable upon the conversion of any convertible
securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights (other than
the Rights)) shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer and also shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of
the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves
the right (i) to waive any such condition, (ii) to increase the price per Share
payable in the Offer and (iii) to make any other changes in the terms of the
Offer; provided, however, that in the case of clause (iii) no other change may
be made which (w) decreases the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer, (x)
reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (y) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex A hereto or (z)
is otherwise disadvantageous to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to the
prior satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the Minimum Condition and
the other conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto, Purchaser shall
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay
for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the
Offer beyond the scheduled expiration date, which shall be 20 Business Days
following the commencement of the Offer, if, at the scheduled expiration of the
Offer, any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment
Shares, shall not be satisfied or waived, or (ii) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer.
In addition, if, on the initial scheduled expiration date and each subsequent
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the sole condition or

                                       13

<PAGE>

conditions remaining unsatisfied are the failure of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), to have expired or been terminated and/or, if there is a Dispute that is
pending or continuing, the Dispute Resolution Period shall not have expired ,
then Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until the fifth Business
Day after the later to occur of (i) expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or (ii) the expiration of the Dispute
Resolution Period. Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent
offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Purchaser shall not terminate the
Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date (as the same may be extended or
required to be extended) without the written consent of the Company except in
the event that Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01. The
Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes, be net to
the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.
Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly
following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable
rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in
part with applicable laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance with
Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act. If the payment equal to the Per Share
Amount in cash (the "Merger Consideration") is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares
is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and

                                       14

<PAGE>

other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that such taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable.

            (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or
shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase")
and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related summary
advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents,
together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein
collectively as the "Offer Documents"). Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree
to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in the Offer
Documents that shall have become false or misleading and to correct any material
omissions, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser
shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent
and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments,
whether written or oral, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after Parent's or Purchaser's, as the case may be, receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its

                                       15

<PAGE>

counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and
its counsel. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository or paying agent,
including the Paying Agent (as hereinafter defined), acting on behalf of Parent
and Purchaser, to return all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

      SECTION 2.02 Company Action.

            (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents that (i) the Board, at a meeting duly called and held on July 8,
2005, has unanimously (A) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively,
the "Transactions") are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of
Shares, (B) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions (such approval and adoption having been made in accordance with
Delaware Law) and (C) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept
the Offer and tender Shares pursuant to the Offer, and approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Transactions, and (ii) Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. has
delivered to the Board an opinion, which will be confirmed promptly in writing,
that the $14.50 per Share dollar amount to be received by the holders of Shares
pursuant to each of the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of Shares
from a financial point of view. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board described in the
immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall not withdraw or modify
such recommendation in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent except as
provided in Section 7.04(c). The Company has been

                                       16

<PAGE>

advised by its directors and executive officers that they intend either to
tender all Shares beneficially owned by them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
or to vote such Shares in favor of the approval and adoption by the stockholders
of the Company of this Agreement and the Transactions.

            (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing, except as
provided in Section 7.04(c), the recommendation of the Board described in
Section 2.02(a), and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent required
by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other applicable
federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and Purchaser agree to correct
promptly any information provided by any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9
which shall have become false or misleading and to correct any material
omissions, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the
SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.
In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the Company's receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall

                                       17

<PAGE>

give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.

            (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent or Purchaser with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories,
each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and
computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of
record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall promptly
furnish Purchaser with such additional information, including, without
limitation, updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels
and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably
request. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser
shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions, and,
if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, shall
deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

      SECTION 2.03 Directors.Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any
Shares by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (provided the Shares so
purchased represent at least a majority of the Shares issued and outstanding),
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded to the
nearest whole number, on the Board as is equal to the product of the total
number of directors on the Board (giving effect to the directors designated by
Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number
of Shares so

                                       18

<PAGE>

accepted for payment bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. In
furtherance of Parent's rights under this Section 2.03, the Company shall, upon
Parent or Purchaser's request, use all reasonable efforts promptly either to
increase the size of the Board or to secure the resignations of such number of
its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parent's designees
to be so elected to the Board, and shall take all actions available to the
Company to cause Parent's designees to be so elected. At such time, the Company
shall also cause persons designated by Parent to have appropriate representation
on (i) each committee of the Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar
body) of each Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such
board. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03, including mailing to
stockholders (as part of the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise) the information
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent's
designees to be elected to the Board (provided that Purchaser shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be
included with respect to Purchaser's designees). In the event that Parent's
designees are elected to the Board, until the Effective Time (as defined below),
the Board shall have at least three directors who are directors on the date of
this Agreement (the "Original Directors"); provided that, in such event, if the
number of Original Directors is reduced below three for any reason whatsoever,
any remaining Original Directors (or Original Director, if there be only one
remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Original Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if
no Original Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three
persons to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders, affiliates or
associates of Parent or Purchaser, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Original Directors for

                                       19

<PAGE>

purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Parent's designees are elected to the Board before the Effective
Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Original Directors shall be
required for the Company to (a) amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or
consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (b) exercise or waive
any of the Company's rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time
for performance of Parent's and Purchaser's respective obligations under this
Agreement, (d) take any other action by the Board under or in connection with
this Agreement, (e) amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company or (f) approve any other action by the Company which could adversely
affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent,
Purchaser and their affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)),
with respect to the Transactions.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   THE MERGER

      SECTION 3.01 The Merger.Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VIII, and in accordance with Delaware Law, Purchaser shall be
merged with and into the Company.

      SECTION 3.02 Effective Time; Closing.As promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this
Agreement or a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger"),
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law (the date and time of such filing being the
"Effective Time"). Prior to such filing, a closing shall be held at the offices
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Four Embarcadero Center, San
Francisco, CA 94111, or such other place

                                       20

<PAGE>

as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or
waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VIII.

      SECTION 3.03 Effect of the Merger.As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). At the
Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

      SECTION 3.04 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws.

            (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Sections 7.06(b) and (c), the
Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation; provided, however, that, at the Effective Time, Article I of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to
read as follows: "The name of the corporation is D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc."

            (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, and subject to Sections 7.06(b) and (c), the By-laws of Purchaser, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.

      SECTION 3.05 Directors and Officers.The directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

      SECTION 3.06 Conversion of Securities.At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

            (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.06(b)
and any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), but including restricted
Shares (whether vested or unvested) issued under Company Stock Plans (defined
below)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration payable, without interest,
to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section
3.09, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share;

            (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share
owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be
made with respect thereto; and

            (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and

                                       22

<PAGE>

exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

      SECTION 3.07 Employee Stock Options.Effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company shall (i) terminate the Company's Amended and Restated 2001 Long
Term Incentive Plan, its 1992 Long Term Incentive Plan and its 1993 Stock Option
Plan, each as amended through the date of this Agreement (the "Company Stock
Plans"), and (ii) cancel, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised
as of such date. Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised at the Effective Time (whether or not such option has vested) shall
be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option,
an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Amount over
(y) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as
of the Effective Time. Any such payment shall be subject to all applicable
federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent. The Company shall take all necessary action to approve the
disposition of the Company Stock Options in connection with the Transactions to
the extent necessary to exempt such dispositions and acquisitions under Rule
l6b-3 of the Exchange Act,

                                       23

<PAGE>

and shall take all necessary action to effect the treatment of the Company Stock
Plans and Company Stock Options set forth in this Section 3.07, including
obtaining all necessary consents.

      SECTION 3.08 Dissenting Shares.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders
shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held
by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.09, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

            (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

                                       24

<PAGE>

      SECTION 3.09 Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

            (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or
trust company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of Shares to
receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 3.06(a). For purposes of determining the amount of Merger Consideration
to be so deposited, Parent and Purchaser shall assume that no stockholder of the
Company will perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and
no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

            (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder
of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger

                                       25

<PAGE>

Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of
the holder of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer books
of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that
such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

            (c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest
and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

            (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the

                                       26

<PAGE>

holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable law.

      SECTION 3.10 Subsequent Actions.If at any time after the Effective Time
the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company
or Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement,
then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or
Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments
and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation
or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the Company's disclosure schedule delivered to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as set forth below. Each
disclosure set forth in the Disclosure Schedule is identified by reference to,
or has been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section
of this Agreement and disclosure made pursuant to any section thereof shall be
deemed to be disclosed on each of the other sections of the Disclosure Schedule
to the extent the

                                       27

<PAGE>

applicability of the disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent on
its face from the disclosure made.

      SECTION 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

            (a) Each of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company
("Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
have such good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.01(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists jurisdictions in which the Company and each Subsidiary is
qualified as a foreign corporation.

            (b) Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business association or entity.

      SECTION 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.The Company has
heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, each as
amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary. Such Certificate of
Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents are in full force
and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of

                                       28

<PAGE>

any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents.

      SECTION 4.03 Capitalization.The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 25,000,000 Shares and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof, (a) 14,260,856 Shares
are issued and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, (b) 1,249,300 Shares are held in the treasury of
the Company, (c) no Shares are held by any Subsidiary or affiliate of the
Company, (d) 49,230 Shares are reserved for future issuance pursuant to employee
stock options, restricted stock or any stock or stock-related incentive rights
to be granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, (e) 1,510,666 Shares are
issuable upon the exercise of existing options to purchase Shares, and (f)
297,970 Shares are subject to outstanding restricted stock agreements. As of the
date hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding.
Except as set forth in this Section 4.03 and Section 4.03 of the Disclosure
Schedule, and except for the rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, dated as of November 12, 1998 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the
Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as rights agent, there are no
options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
any Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or any other security
exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, any such shares or other
equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary. All Shares subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be, when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations,

                                       29

<PAGE>

arrangements or commitments of any character of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares, any other capital stock of,
or other equity interest in the Company or any Subsidiary or to provide funds
to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or any other person. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary having
the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any
Subsidiary may vote. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all such
shares are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on the Company's or any Subsidiary's voting rights,
charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

      SECTION 4.04 Authority Relative to This Agreement.The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Shares,
if and to the extent required by applicable law, and the filing and recordation
of appropriate merger documents as required by Delaware Law). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser,

                                       30

<PAGE>

constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii)
the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. Assuming the accuracy of
the representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.08, the action taken by
the Board in approving this Agreement and the Transactions is sufficient to
render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions the restrictions on
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the Delaware Law.

      SECTION 4.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

            (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) assuming all
consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section
4.05(b) have been obtained or taken, conflict with or violate any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, agency
requirement, code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree, arbitral award
or other order ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which
any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset
of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to,

                                       31

<PAGE>

any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), (1) as set forth in Section 4.05 of the Disclosure
Schedule and (2) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger
or otherwise would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any United States federal, state, county, foreign or local governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency, instrumentality or commission (a
"Governmental Entity") or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body
(together with a Governmental Entity, a "Governmental Authority"), except for
(i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) any
filings as may be required under Delaware Law in connection with the Merger,
(iii) filings permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required
under the HSR Act, (iv) the filing with the SEC and the Nasdaq National Market,
Inc. ("Nasdaq") of (A) the Schedule 14D-9, (B) the Proxy Statement (as
hereinafter defined) if stockholder approval is required by law, (C) the
information required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act and (D) such reports
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions, (v) such filings and approvals as may be
required by any applicable state securities or blue sky laws, and (vi) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or

                                       32

<PAGE>

to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger, or otherwise would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement, and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

      SECTION 4.06 Permits; Compliance.

            (a) Except as set forth in Part I of Section 4.06 of the Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Company and each Subsidiary is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for each of the Company and the Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted (the "Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension
or cancellation of, any of the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or otherwise would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any of the
Permits, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Part II of
Section 4.06 of the Disclosure

                                       33

<PAGE>

Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in conflict with, in default
under, or in breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or
any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any Contract to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any property
or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound, except for any such
conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 4.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

            (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.07(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has timely filed all forms, reports and documents
(including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) required to be
filed by it with the SEC since June 30, 2002 (the forms, reports and other
documents referred to above being, collectively, the "SEC Reports"). The SEC
Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and in the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, applicable to such SEC Reports, (ii)
the SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the expiration of the Offer,
then on the date of such filing), complied in all material respects with all
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and,
in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, applicable to
such SEC Reports and (iii) did not, at the time

                                       34

<PAGE>

they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.
The SEC Reports included or, with respect to such reports filed after the date
hereof, will include all certificates required to be included therein pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "SOX
Act"), and the internal control report and attestation of the Company's outside
auditors required by Section 404 of the SOX Act.

            (b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the SOX Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. The Company has implemented disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities. The Company and each
Subsidiary (i) makes and keeps accurate books and records and (ii) maintains
internal accounting controls which provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of its financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for its assets, (c) access to its assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization and (d) the
reported accounting for its assets and liabilities is compared with existing
assets and liabilities at reasonable intervals. The Company has prepared a plan
to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the SOX Act on the date by
which it must comply with such requirements.

                                       35

<PAGE>

Except as set forth in Section 4.07(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
is not aware of any reason it will not comply with the requirements of Section
404 of the SOX Act on the applicable compliance date and has no knowledge of any
"significant deficiency" or "material weakness" in the Company's internal
controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and
"material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Statements
of Auditing Standards No. 60, as in effect on the date hereof.

            (c) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as
otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material).

            (d) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries as at June 30,
2004, including the notes thereto (the "2004 Balance Sheet"), neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities and
obligations, incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2004, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or otherwise would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing

                                       36

<PAGE>

its obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (e) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and
correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed by
the Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently in
effect.

            (f) Set forth on Section 4.07(f) of the Disclosure Schedule is the
most recently prepared financial outlook for the Company and Subsidiaries for
fiscal year 2006 (the "Outlook"). Management of the Company prepared the Outlook
in good faith based upon assumptions it believes are reasonable as of the date
hereof; it is understood that all projections are subject to significant
uncertainties and that no representation is being made hereby that the projected
results will be achieved.

            (g) There are no uninstalled Units that have been recorded into

and its Subsidiaries reflected on the 2004 Balance Sheet or arising thereafter

practices. Since June 30, 2004, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

manner consistent with past practices. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has received written or oral notice that it will experience in the foreseeable
future any material difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality
and at a reasonable price and upon reasonable terms and conditions, the products
it distributes. The values at which inventories are carried reflect the
inventory valuation policy of the Company and the Subsidiaries, which is
consistent with its past practice and in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis. Since the date of the 2004 Balance Sheet, due provision has
been made on the books of the Company and the Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice

<PAGE>

slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories and such inventory reserves are
adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and

inventory on hand and commitments to purchase inventory do not exceed, in the

Subsidiary; provided, however, that after the date hereof, no such cancellation,
termination, communication or decrease

                                       68

shall result in a breach of this Section 4.26 unless such cancellation,
termination, communication or decrease would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

      Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant

affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific

approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.03(b) have
been obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 5.03(b) have
been made, conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment
or decree applicable to Parent or Purchaser or by which any property or asset of
either of them is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien
or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent or Purchaser pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Purchaser
is a party or by which Parent or Purchaser or any property or asset of either of
them is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which,

materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise would not
reasonably be expected to prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement.

Purchaser, except for (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, (ii) any filings as may be required under Delaware Law in

may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, (v) such
filings and approvals as may be required by any applicable state securities or
blue sky laws, and (vi) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions, or otherwise would not
reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement.

      SECTION 5.04 Financing. Parent has and will have through the Effective
Time access to sufficient funds to permit Purchaser to consummate all the
Transactions, including, without limitation, acquiring all the outstanding

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make

                                       71

<PAGE>

the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, or at the
time of the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Stockholders' Meeting which shall have become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing
documents or the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents shall comply in all
material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

      SECTION 5.06 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Purchaser.

      SECTION 5.07 Absence of Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent and the Purchaser, threatened against Parent or the
Purchaser, or any property or asset of Parent or the Purchaser, before any
Governmental Authority that seeks to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of any Transaction. Neither Parent nor the Purchaser nor any
property or asset of Parent or the Purchaser is subject to any continuing order
of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or,
to the knowledge of Parent or the Purchaser, continuing investigation by, any
Governmental Authority, or any

                                       72

<PAGE>

order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or otherwise would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
Parent or the Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this
Agreement.

any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law. Each of

record) and is not a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for
the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any
shares of capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this
Agreement).

<PAGE>

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser shall

the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, shall furnish
Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data and
information as Parent or Purchaser, through its officers, employees or agents,

Company and take all action to facilitate the physical inventory inspection
contemplated by clause (l) of Annex A.

            (b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this

      SECTION 7.04 No Solicitation of Transactions.

            (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. From the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its
Subsidiaries' directors, officers or employees or any investment banker,
financial

                                       79

<PAGE>

advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of
its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any nonpublic information or data to any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) make or authorize any
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of, or execute or enter
into, or propose to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement related to, any Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such representative is so authorized and whether or
not such representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the consummation of the
Offer the Board shall be permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations
with, or provide nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person first made
after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this
Section 7.04 which the Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, only (1) if and only to the extent that
the Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, (2) if, prior to furnishing such
information to or entering into negotiations or discussions with such person,
the Company enters into a

                                       80

<PAGE>

confidentiality agreement with such person having provisions that are no less
restrictive to such person than those applicable to Parent and contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (3) if the Company complies with all of the terms
of this Section 7.04. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable
(and in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person or that informs the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the
identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and
the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers
(including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or
correspondence). The Company shall also notify Parent, in writing, as promptly
as practicable (and in no event later than 24 hours prior to) any meeting of the
Board called to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to
consider providing nonpublic information to any person. The Company shall notify
Parent, in writing, of any decision of the Board as to whether to consider such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or to enter into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide nonpublic information or data
to any person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such
meeting (and in any event no later than 24 hours after such determination was
reached and 24 hours prior to entering into any discussions or negotiations or
providing any nonpublic information or data to any person). The Company agrees
that it shall keep Parent informed of the status and terms of any such
inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis,
including by: delivering a copy of all documentation and

                                       81

<PAGE>

correspondence relating thereto promptly upon receipts thereof, delivering to
Parent the information delivered to such person to the extent such information
was not previously provided to Parent and providing Parent with 24 hours prior
notice of each Board meeting called to discuss or consider any Acquisition
Proposal.

            (c) The Board shall not (i) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Board's recommendation to accept the Offer
or (ii) approve, enter into or recommend that stockholders approve or accept a
Superior Proposal unless, prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Board
determines in good faith after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and that failure to do so would result in a reasonable
likelihood of a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable
law, in which case, the Board may (subject to this and the following sentences)
withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the
Board's recommendation and take and disclose to the stockholders of the Company
a position with respect to the Superior Proposal and, to the extent applicable,
comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to such
Superior Proposal by disclosing such withdrawn, modified or changed Board
recommendation and any recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal in
connection with a tender or exchange offer for the Company's securities,
provided that: (1) the Company shall have notified Parent, in writing no later
than five (5) Business Days' prior to the Board's withdrawing or changing its
recommendation, that the Board has determined (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that Board intends to withdraw or change its
recommendation with respect to the Offer or approve, recommend, or enter into an
agreement with respect to, the Superior Proposal, which notice shall

                                       82

<PAGE>

include the identity of the person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of
the final terms of the Superior Proposal; (2) during such five (5) Business Day
period, the Board shall have given due consideration to any proposals made by
Parent to adjust the Offer and the Transactions; and (3) the Board shall have
determined (A) after consultation with its financial advisor, that any such
proposal made by or on behalf of Parent is less favorable to the stockholders of
the Company than the Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside
legal counsel, it would result in a reasonable likelihood that the Board would
breach its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
law if it failed to withdraw or change its recommendation with respect to the
Offer and the Transactions or failed to approve or enter into the Superior
Proposal or recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept or approve the
Superior Proposal. The Board shall not, in connection with any such withdrawal,
modification or change of its recommendation, take any action to change the
approval of the Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other state law or the Rights Agreement to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger,
provided, however, that this sentence shall not prohibit the Company from
withdrawing, modifying or changing its recommendation or approving or entering
into or recommending any Superior Proposal under the circumstances and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Section 7.04(c). Nothing contained in this
Section 7.04 shall prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance
with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action
taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement.

                                       83

            (d) The Company agrees that (i) it will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents, representatives
and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it will not
release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any its Subsidiaries is a party with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

      SECTION 7.05 Employee Benefits Matters. Parent agrees that from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in
accordance with their terms the employment contracts of the Company set forth in
Section 7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule. Employees of the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries will be provided with employee benefits that are in the
aggregate no less favorable than those employee benefits that are provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. Employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals, determination of levels
of benefits or any other purposes) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time
with the Company or any Subsidiary to the same extent such service was taken
into account for such purposes under comparable Plans prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.05 nor any other provision of this
Agreement shall limit the ability or right of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and their subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any of their
respective employees after the Effective Time or to terminate or amend any Plan.
Prior to the Effective

                                       84

<PAGE>

Time, if requested by Parent, the Company shall terminate the Company's Code
Section 401(k) plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") in accordance with all
provisions of applicable law, and each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan
shall have the right to receive a distribution of such participant's account
balance in the Company 401(k) Plan (subject to, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the plan and applicable law).

      SECTION 7.06 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

            (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement,
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts
to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after
the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including advances of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses prior to
the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual
claim,

                                       85

<PAGE>

action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that:
(1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such
assumption Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises that there are (under applicable standards of professional
conduct) issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties; (2)
Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for
only one firm or counsel and any necessary local counsel for all Indemnified
Parties except that if counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
that there are (under applicable standards of professional conduct) issues which
raise conflicts of interest among one or more of the Indemnified Parties, Parent
will be obligated to pay for separate counsel such Indemnified Parties as to
which there are conflicts; (3) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (4) Parent shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. It is agreed and understood
that Parent's agreement to provide the indemnification contemplated hereunder is
no way intended to expand the scope of the

                                       86

<PAGE>

indemnification obligations beyond that which a corporation would be permitted
to provide to its own officers or directors under Delaware Law. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 7.06, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent thereof, provided that the failure to so notify Parent shall not affect
the obligations of Parent under this Section 7.06 except to the extent such
failure to notify prejudices Parent. Parent's obligations under this Section
7.06 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim (a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

            (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous than such current policy) covering the persons serving as officers
and directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such
officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend on an annual basis more than three
hundred percent (300%) of the current amount expended by the Company (the
"Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage; and further
provided that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for
by this Section 7.06(b) Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain as
much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; and
provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations under
this Section 7.06(b) may be satisfied if the Surviving Corporation purchases a
"tail" policy

                                       87

<PAGE>

under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy that (i)
has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers
those persons who are officers and directors of the Company on the date of this
Agreement, for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including without limitation coverage
amounts) that are at least as favorable in the aggregate as the terms and
conditions of the Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect
on the date hereof.

            (c) Until six years from the Effective Time, unless otherwise
required by applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
the elimination of liability of directors and the indemnification of directors
and officers (including as to advancement of expenses) than are set forth in the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, as in effect on
the date hereof.

            (d) In the event the Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

            (e) The provisions of this Section 7.06 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives and

                                       88

<PAGE>

shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

      SECTION 7.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which reasonably would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

      SECTION 7.08 Further Action; Reasonable Efforts.

            (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall (i) make promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after execution of this Agreement) its respective filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect
to the Transactions and (ii) use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including, without limitation,
using all reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as are necessary for
the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Offer
and the Merger. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out

                                       89

<PAGE>

the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such action.
Parent or the Purchaser will pay all filing fees associated with the HSR
submission.

            (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use all
reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Action, including
administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or
prohibits consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation, by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

      SECTION 7.09 Public Announcements. Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree
that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions, the Offer or
the Merger shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release
or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States securities exchange or Nasdaq, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other
party time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

<PAGE>

            (b) HSR Act. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated;

            (c) No Order. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which is then in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition
of Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or
otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Transactions; and

            (d) Offer. Purchaser or its permitted assignee shall have purchased

Company duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company; or

            (b) By Parent, Purchaser or the Company if (i) the Effective Time
shall not have occurred on or before January 8, 2006, at any time thereafter;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date or (ii) any
Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) which has become final and

                                       91

<PAGE>

nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Offer or the
Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer
or the Merger; or

result in a failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Annex A hereto,

applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and, if there is a Dispute pending
and continuing, the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period and (y) January
8, 2006), unless such action or inaction under clauses (A), (B) or (C) shall

perform, in any material respect, any of their material covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or the material breach by Parent or Purchaser of
any of their material representations or warranties contained in this Agreement;
or

            (d) By Parent, if prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, (i) the Board shall have failed to include in the Schedule 14D-9 or the
Proxy Statement, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer,

at any time prior to

                                       95

<PAGE>

this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of

this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, if such termination is permitted
pursuant thereto, shall not give rise to an inference that a party entitled to
so terminate this Agreement has waived its right to do so.

      SECTION 10.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

      SECTION 10.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of
law or otherwise), except that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of
their rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Parent, provided that
no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

      SECTION 10.05 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement, other than the first sentence of Section 7.05 and Section
7.06 (which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such persons). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
expressly

                                       98

<PAGE>

understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 7.05 (other than the first
sentence of Section 7.05) are statements of intent and, except as provided
above, no employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other
person (including any party hereto) shall have any rights or remedies, including
rights of enforcement, with respect thereto and no such employee of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation or other person is or is intended to be a
third-party beneficiary thereof.

      SECTION 10.06 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy at law or equity.

      SECTION 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court thereof, for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent the Court of Chancery has
jurisdiction over the claims alleged in such litigation, or, if the Court of
Chancery does not have jurisdiction over the claims alleged in such litigation,
the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America located
in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such litigation except in such
courts, (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation
in such Delaware courts and (iii) agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware
court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient

forum. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.02. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

      SECTION 10.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.08.

different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

                                     ANNEX A

                             CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and
may extend, terminate or amend the Offer, if (i) immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer, the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied,
(ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or
been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer, or (iii) at any time on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Offer, any
of the following conditions shall exist:

            (a) there shall have been instituted any Action by any Governmental
      Entity (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, materially delay, or
      otherwise, directly or indirectly, restrain or prohibit or make materially
      more costly, the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of any
      Shares by Parent, Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent, or the
      purchase of Shares, or the consummation of any other Transaction, or
      seeking to obtain material damages in connection with any Transaction;
      (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit materially the ownership or operation by
      the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries of all or any of the
      business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries
      that is material to either Parent and its subsidiaries or the Company and
      the Subsidiaries, in either case, taken as a whole, or to compel the
      Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries, as a result of the
      Transactions, to dispose of or to hold separate all or any portion of the
      business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries
      that is material to either Parent and its subsidiaries or the Company and
      the Subsidiaries, in each case, taken as a whole; (iii) seeking to impose
      or confirm any limitation on the ability of Parent, Purchaser or any

                                      A-1

<PAGE>

      other affiliate of Parent to exercise effectively full rights of ownership
      of any Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote any Shares
      acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or otherwise on all matters
      properly presented to the Company's stockholders, including, without
      limitation, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
      Transactions; (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent, Purchaser or
      any other affiliate of Parent of any Shares; or (v) which, individually or
      in the aggregate, otherwise would reasonably be expected to prevent or
      materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise
      would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Company
      from performing its obligations under this Agreement or would reasonably
      be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

            (b) any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree,
      injunction or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
      enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or materially delaying or preventing
      the Transactions and such order, decree, injunction, ruling or other
      action shall have become final and non-appealable;

            (c) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation
      or interpretation enacted, promulgated, amended or issued applicable to
      (i) Parent, the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or the
      Company or (ii) any Transaction, by any United States or Governmental
      Authority with appropriate jurisdiction, other than the routine
      application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer
      or the Merger, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or
      indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i) through
      (v) of paragraph (a) above;

                                      A-2

<PAGE>

            (d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any Material Adverse
      Effect, or any occurrence, circumstance or event that is reasonably likely
      to result in a Material Adverse Effect, shall have occurred;

            (e) there shall have occurred (i) a declaration of a banking
      moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United
      States (whether or not mandatory), (ii) any limitation (whether or not
      mandatory) by any United States Governmental Entity on the extension of
      credit generally by banks or other financial institutions, or (iii) in the
      case of either of the foregoing existing at the time of the commencement
      of the Offer, a material acceleration or worsening thereof;

            (f) any representation or warranty of the Company in the Agreement
      that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not
      be true and correct in any respect or any such representation or warranty
      that is not so qualified shall not be true and correct in any material
      respect, in each case as if such representation or warranty was made as of
      such time on or after the date of this Agreement;

            (g) the Company shall have failed to perform, in any material
      respect, any obligation or to comply, in any material respect, with any
      agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by
      it under the Agreement; provided Parent shall have given notice to the
      Company in reasonable detail of such failure to perform or comply and, if
      such failure is capable of cure within thirty (30) days, the Company shall
      not have cured any such failure capable of cure within thirty (30) days
      after receipt of such notice;

            (h) the Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall have (i)
      withdrawn, or modified or changed in a manner adverse to the Transactions,
      to Parent or to Purchaser (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9),
      its recommendation of the Offer, this

                                      A-3

<PAGE>

      Agreement, or the Merger, (ii) recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
      taken a neutral position or made no recommendation with respect to another
      proposal or offer (other than by Parent or Purchaser) after a reasonable
      amount of time (and in no event more than ten (10) Business Days following
      receipt thereof) has elapsed for the Board or any committee thereof to
      review and make a recommendation with respect thereto or (iv) resolved to
      do any of the foregoing;

            (i) the Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate
      executed by the Company's President or a Vice President of the Company on
      behalf of the Company, dated as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer,
      to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (f), (g), (i),
      and (l) of this Annex A have not occurred;

            (j) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
      terms;

            (k) Purchaser and the Company shall have agreed in writing that
      Purchaser shall terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment
      of Shares thereunder; or

            (l) the useable and saleable (and not expired or short-dated)
      inventories of the eighty percent (80%) Items of the Company and the
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as determined by Parent after physical
      inspection thereof and valued in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
      with the past practices of the Company, have a realizable value (net of
      reserves) more than five percent (5%) less than the carrying value of the
      inventories of the eighty percent (80%) Items of the Company and its
      Subsidiaries, taken as whole, reflected on the consolidated balance sheet
      of the Company and its Subsidiaries dated as of the date of such physical
      inspection of the inventory; provided, however, that (A) Parent shall have
      conducted its physical inspection as promptly as practicable and in any
      event within five (5) Business Days after the later of (x) the date of
      this Agreement and (y) the date Parent shall

                                      A-4

<PAGE>

      have been given full access to the facilities of the Company and the
      Subsidiaries required by Parent to conduct the physical inspection of the
      inventories contemplated by this clause (the "Completion Date"), (B) if
      Parent shall have determined that this condition has not been satisfied,
      Parent shall have notified the Company of such determination within five
      (5) Business Days after the Completion Date, which notice shall include
      Parent's calculations and a detailed explanation of the basis upon which
      Parent contends the condition has not been satisfied and (C) if the
      Company shall have notified Parent within two (2) Business Days after
      Parent's notice that the Company disputes (a "Dispute") Parent's
      calculations, the Firm shall not have determined (which determination
      shall be final and binding upon the parties), after review the positions
      of Parent and the Company with respect to the Dispute and the performance
      of appropriate testing procedures (as reasonably determined by the Firm)
      and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days (the "Dispute Resolution
      Period") after its acceptance of its selection, that this condition has
      been satisfied, (it being understood that Parent and the Company will
      promptly provide to the Firm all information it reasonably requests to
      assist it to reach its determination and will instruct the Firm to
      endeavor to make its determination as promptly as practicable),

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including action or inaction by Parent or
Purchaser) giving rise to such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with
the Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment of the Shares; provided,
however, that Purchaser may not terminate the Offer on the basis of a condition
that exists as a result of a breach by Parent or Purchaser of their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

                                      A-5

<PAGE>

      The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser,
may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser. The failure by
Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time-to-time.
