ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act (" _FBCA_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto, conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, and in any event within three (3) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), at the offices of Holland and Knight LLP, 1600 Tysons Boulevard, Suite 700, McLean, VA 22102, unless another time or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company (and may take place by conference call and facsimile or email transfer of signature pages and deliverables with exchange of original signatures by overnight mail). The date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with the Florida Department of State (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), in accordance with the applicable provisions of the FBCA (the time of the acceptance of such filing by the Florida Department of State, which shall be the effective time of the Merger, shall be referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall treat the Closing as being effective as of 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of FBCA.

 1.4 _Formation Documents of Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be identical to the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the FBCA and as provided in such articles of incorporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Boston Proper, Inc." 

   

 (b) _Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time (other than any change to the name of the Surviving Corporation that is set forth in the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation) until thereafter amended in accordance with the FBCA and as provided in the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws. 

   

 1.5 _Management of Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) _Directors of Company_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the FBCA and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

   

 (b) _Officers of Company_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.6 _Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations_. 

  

 (a) _Effect on Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, the holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, unexercised Company Options and treasury stock), or any other Person, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the following shall occur: 

   

 (i) Each share of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted 

   ##### 

  

 

automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares of Series C Preferred Stock in the manner provided
in this Agreement, without interest, the sum of (A) (i) the Final Per Share
Consideration, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) 1,333.33 (the conversion rate
to Company Common Stock of the Series C Preferred Stock) _plus_ (B) the
Series C Per Share Dividends. 

   

 (ii) Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Series B Preferred Stock in the manner provided in this Agreement, without interest, the product of (A) the Final Per Share Consideration, _multiplied_ _by_ (B) 1,333.33 (the conversion rate to Company Common Stock of the Series B Preferred Stock). 

  

 (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in this Agreement, without interest, the Final Per Share Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Treasury Stock_. Each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Undesignated Preferred Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or authorized but currently unissued stock immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, will be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and will cease to exist. 

   

 (c) _Treatment of Company Options_. 

   

 (i) No Company Option shall be assumed or otherwise replaced by Parent. The Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to provide that immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested and regardless of the exercise price thereof) shall be cancelled and each holder of a Company Vested Option (a " _Vested Optionholder_ ") shall be entitled to the right to receive for each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Company Vested Option(s) held by such Vested Optionholder a cash payment, subject to the withholding provisions contained herein, in an amount equal to (A) the Estimated Per Share Consideration, _plus_ (B) the quotient of the Excess Amount (if any) divided by the Company Common Stock Deemed Outstanding, _minus_ (C) the exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company Option(s) ( _provided_ , that if such exercise price is greater than (x) the Estimated Per Share Consideration plus (y) the quotient of the Excess Amount (if any) divided by the Company Common Stock Deemed Outstanding, such amount shall be zero dollars ($0)). Such cash payment to a Vested Optionholder by the Payment Agent or Shareholder Representatives shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law and the payor shall remit any such withholdings to the appropriate Taxing authorities. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Vested Optionholder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that immediately prior to the Effective Time and conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, (A) the Company Option Plans shall be terminated, and (B) no holder of any Company Option will have any right to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company or, if applicable, the Surviving Corporation, upon exercise of any Company Option. 

  

 (d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are so converted shall be the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall, after the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.7 _Closing Payments_. 

  

 (a) _Closing Date Certificate_. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will prepare and deliver to Parent a certificate (the " _Closing Date Certificate_ ") signed by the Company certifying the Companys good faith estimate of all payments required at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, including or attaching:

 (ii) a statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") and setting forth the Companys good faith estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the Estimated Net Working Capital Differential; 

  

 (iii) a statement (the " _Estimated Net Debt Statement_ ") setting forth (A) the Companys good faith estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the Closing Net Debt (the " _Estimated Net Debt_ ") and (B) a schedule of the estimated amounts of all Company Debt as of the Closing Date, including information on each creditor to whom such amounts are payable, accompanied by a pay-off letter from each such creditor, which pay-off letter shall provide for the release of all Liens associated therewith upon payment of the sums specified therein, all in customary form or a form otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Parent;

To the extent that any of the aforementioned amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Securityholder or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 1.9 _Paying Agent_. 

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholder Representatives (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to serve as the paying agent for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a Paying Agent Agreement, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the Shareholder Representatives, to be entered into by and among Parent, the Shareholder Representatives and the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ").

  

 (b) In order for a Shareholder to receive payment from the Paying Agent for such Shareholders shares of Company Capital Stock, such Shareholder shall be required to provide the Paying Agent (i) a duly executed letter of transmittal in the form as Parent, the Shareholder Representatives and the Paying Agent shall specify (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), (ii) an executed Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, and (iii) either the applicable stock certificate(s) or an affidavit of lost stock certificate and indemnity agreement in the form attached to the Letter of Transmittal.

 (e) If payment or delivery is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Company stock certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company stock certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on the Company stock certificate or any related stock power be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Company stock certificate so surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

 (f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (g) Any portion of the amounts that have not been distributed by the Paying Agent upon termination of the Paying Agent Agreement, if any, shall be released and remitted by the Paying Agent to Parent, and any Shareholders or Vested Optionholders who have not theretofore complied with the requirements hereunder and under the Paying Agent Agreement

 1.10 _Post-Closing Adjustments_. 

 

 (a) _Calculation of Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration_.

   

 (i) Within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to the Shareholder Representatives a statement (the " _Parent Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculation of (A) the actual Closing Net Working Capital, (B) the actual Closing Net Debt and (C) the actual Outstanding Company Transaction and Other Expenses (each of clauses (A), (B) and (C), a " _Merger Consideration Adjustment Component_ "), along with a description in reasonable detail of each adjustment from the calculations of Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Net Debt, and Estimated Outstanding Company Transaction and Other Expenses. The Parent Closing Statement delivered by Parent shall also set forth any adjustment in the Net Merger Consideration due to such adjustments. 

  

 (ii) The Shareholder Representatives may dispute any item or amount set forth in the Parent Closing Statement, at any time within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Parent Closing Statement, by delivering to Parent a written notice of such dispute (a " _Notice of Dispute_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail and to the extent practicable, (A) each item or amount so disputed by the Shareholder Representatives, (B) the Shareholder Representatives calculation of each such disputed item or amount, and (C) the Shareholder Representatives calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment Components and the actual Net Merger Consideration after giving effect to the Shareholder Representatives calculation of each such disputed item or amount. In the event the Shareholder Representatives are not given reasonable access pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iv) promptly following its request, then the foregoing thirty (30) calendar day period will be increased by one day for each day that the Shareholder Representative and their representatives are not given prompt and reasonable access. If the Shareholder Representatives do not deliver a Notice of Dispute within the thirty (30) calendar day period (as such period may be increased pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), the Shareholder Representatives shall be deemed to have agreed in all respects with the Parent Closing Statement and the amounts reflected therein shall be final and binding. 

  

 (iii) If Parent shall receive a Notice of Dispute from the Shareholder Representatives delivered pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.10(a)(ii) within the time period set forth therein, then Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all disputed items and amounts set forth in the Notice of Dispute pursuant to good faith negotiations. In the event that Parent and the Shareholder Representatives are unable to reach agreement, within thirty (30) calendar days following Parents receipt of a Notice of Dispute, on all of the disputed items or amounts set forth in a Notice of Dispute, then: 

   ##### 

  

  

 A. Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall execute a memorandum (the " _Merger Consideration Adjustment Memorandum_ ") setting forth (1) the resolved items or amounts, if any, and (2) the items or amounts included in the Notice of Dispute that remain in dispute following such good faith negotiations, with the position of each party with respect thereto (provided if they cannot agree on the terms of a single memorandum, each shall prepare and execute a separate memorandum which together shall be deemed the Merger Consideration Adjustment Memorandum); 

  

 B. Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall submit all remaining disputed items and amounts set forth in the Merger Consideration Adjustment Memorandum to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The Independent Accounting firm will be jointly engaged by Parent, on one hand, and the Shareholder Representatives, on the other hand, pursuant to an engagement letter in customary form which Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall execute. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to, provide full cooperation to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (1) act as an arbitrator, (2) consider only those items and amounts identified in the Merger Consideration Adjustment Memorandum as being in dispute between Parent and the Shareholder Representatives, (3) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such dispute consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and within thirty (30) calendar days after its appointment and provide a written explanation of its decision, and (4) not (x) determine any liability claimed by the Shareholder Representatives or asset claimed by Parent in an amount less than that claimed by such party, or (y) determine any asset claimed by the Shareholder Representatives or liability claimed by Parent in an amount in excess of the amount claimed by such party. All fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm) incurred in connection with any such dispute will be borne by the parties based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such party bears to the amount actually contested by the parties (e.g., if the total amount in dispute is $70,000 and the Independent Accounting Firm agrees with the Shareholder Representatives with respect to $40,000 of such amount in dispute, then the Shareholders will be responsible for three-sevenths (3/7th) of the fees and expenses and Parent will be responsible for four-sevenths (4/7th) of the fees and expenses). The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine all disputed items and amounts and in the absence of fraud or manifest error, its decision in respect thereof shall be final and binding upon (and unappealable by) Parent, the Shareholder Representatives and the Securityholders; and 

  

 C. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term " _Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration_ " shall mean the actual finally determined Net Merger Consideration, based upon (1) all amounts agreed upon by Parent and the Shareholder Representatives, and (2) all other amounts determined by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii)B. Upon the determination of the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration, the Parent Closing Statement shall be deemed to be adjusted to include the finally determined amounts. 

 

 (iv) During the period of time from and after the date of the delivery of the Parent Closing Statement to the Shareholder Representatives until the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration has been finally determined pursuant to and in accordance with this

    ##### 

  

     

Section 1.10(a), Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representatives and
their accountants, counsel and other consultants and experts retained by the
Shareholder Representatives, as well as the Independent Accounting Firm in
connection with its engagement, if applicable, with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, records, accounts, files and employees of
the Company pertaining to the determination of the Merger Consideration
Adjustment Components and the working papers used by Parent or its
accountants to prepare the Parent Closing Statement, and each party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the others reasonable
inquiries regarding the Parent Closing Statement and disputes in connection
therewith. 

  

 (b) _Post-Closing Payment Based on Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration_.

   

 (i) If the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Adjusted Net Merger Consideration (such difference, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.10(a) (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Escrow Account and deliver to (A) Parent an amount in cash equal to the Shortfall Amount, which amount paid to Parent shall be accounted for as having been paid by each Shareholder from the Escrow Funds based on each Shareholders Pro Rata Portion, and (B) the Shareholder Representatives, for distribution to the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Pro Rata Portion, the amount, if any, by which Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) exceeds the Shortfall Amount. 

  

 (ii) If the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Adjusted Net Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.10(a) (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), (A) Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Escrow Account and deliver to the Shareholder Representatives, for distribution to the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Pro Rata Portion, an aggregate amount of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) and (B) Parent shall pay the Excess Amount (less the amount of all income and employment Taxes to be withheld on such payments as directed by the Shareholder Representatives prior to such payment due date) to the Paying Agent and cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay to each Securityholder an amount of cash (without interest) equal to their Ownership Percentage of the Excess Amount; and the amount of such income and employment Taxes so withheld will be paid by Parent to the Company, and which will be paid by the Company to the appropriate Taxing authorities. 

  

 1.11 _Appraisal Rights_. Each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by Shareholders who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights with respect thereto under Sections 607.1301- 607.1333 of the FBCA (such shares of Company Capital Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), subject to the terms of any shareholder or similar agreements to which the Shareholders are bound, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Final Per Share Consideration pursuant to the Merger, but shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares from the Surviving Corporation or Parent in accordance with the provisions of Sections 607.1301- 607.1333 of the FBCA, except 

   ##### 

  

  

that each Dissenting Share held by a Shareholder who shall thereafter withdraw
its demand for appraisal or shall fail to perfect its right to such payment
as provided in such Sections 607.1301- 607.1333 of the FBCA shall be deemed
to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation or Parent the Final Per Share Consideration in the form
such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive as a result of the
Merger. Any party hereto shall provide the other parties with prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any
other instruments served pursuant to Sections 607.1301  607.1333 of the FBCA
and received in connection with the Merger, and the Shareholder
Representatives shall have the opportunity to direct and settle all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Shareholder
Representatives shall conduct, and Parent shall be entitled to participate in,
all such negotiations and proceedings in good faith, and shall endeavor to
resolve all such demands as promptly as practicable (and in any event prior
to the termination of the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement). The Shareholder Representatives will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to
settle, any such demands. 

   

 1.12 _Transaction Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 5.12(d), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Third Party Transaction Expenses shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses, _provided that_ , in the event the Merger is consummated, the Outstanding Company Transaction and Other Expenses shall be paid as set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

Companys Board of Directors to the Shareholders under Applicable Law and (y)
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. In

receiving advice from its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
any such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then the Companys
Board of Directors may make a Change in Recommendation, and subject to the
provisions of Section 8.1(g), terminate this Agreement.

The Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of the Company, (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all employees of the Company as identified by Parent (subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to restrictions imposed by applicable Law and pre-existing confidentiality obligations enforceable against the Company). All requests for access or other information pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be submitted or directed by Parent exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof. 

  

 5.3 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 5.2, or pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement by and between Parent and the Company, dated as of October 29, 2010, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 5.4 _Public Disclosure_. No party shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than their respective agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions, the Shareholders in connection with the Soliciting Materials and the Shareholder Notice, and in connection with the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Article VI) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except that this restriction shall be subject to Parents obligation to comply with applicable securities laws and the rules of any securities exchange on which shares of Parent common stock may be listed. In the event that any such statement or communication by Parent prior to the Effective Time is required by, or advisable under, applicable securities laws or the rules of any securities exchange, Parent shall notify the Company and the Shareholder Representatives prior to such disclosure and provide the Company and the Shareholder Representatives with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such statement or communication, which comments Parent shall consider in good faith. 

  

 5.5 _Consents_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Material Contract as are required 

   ##### 

  

 

thereunder in connection with the Merger. In the event that, prior to the
Effective Time, the other parties to any Material Contract, including lessor
or licensor of any Leased Real Property, conditions its grant of a consent,
waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or
other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing"
payment or other consideration, including increased rent payments or other
payments under the Material Contract, and the Company agrees to such
condition in its sole discretion, then the Company shall be responsible for
making all payments required to obtain such consent, waiver or approval and
such amounts, if not paid prior to the Closing Date, shall be deemed
Outstanding Company Transaction and Other Expenses. 

   

 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time such that if the Closing Date were to take place on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the date of such event the condition in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as applicable, could not be met, and (ii) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that if the Closing Date were to take place on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the date of such failure the condition in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as applicable, could not be met; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the next sentence, no disclosure by a party pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth herein, if any representation or warranty made by the Company herein would no longer be correct due to any matter, change, fact, circumstance, occurrence, development or event occurring or arising during the period after the execution of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, and such matter (i) constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) after the Effective Time would directly or indirectly subject the Shareholders to indemnification obligations (whether from the Escrow Account or otherwise) of an amount in excess of $2,500,000, and the Shareholder Representatives so notify Parent in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and Parent elects not to terminate this Agreement, then the Indemnified Parties will not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement solely with respect to the items that constitute such Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 5.7 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or 

        ##### 

  

    

advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to satisfy the conditions to
the obligations to consummate the Merger, to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings
and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or
otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties
hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.8 _Employee Matters_. Employees of the Company who continue to be employed by Parent, the Company or any of its Affiliates following the Effective Time will be given full credit for their years of service with the Company before the Effective Time for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in employee benefit plans, leave and programs of Parent and its Affiliates that are made available to such Employees after the Effective Time. Parent agrees to maintain levels of employee benefits (other than equity-based benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to those provided by the Company prior to Effective Time until the end of Parents 2012 fiscal year. 

  

 5.9 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director, officer, Employee, fiduciary and agent of the Company (each, a " _Company Indemnitee_ ") provided for in Charter Documents shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company and such officers and directors. 

   

 (b) The obligations under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein). 

   

 5.10 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. The Company, at its cost and expense, will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company after the Closing Date which apply to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. No later than thirty (30) days prior to filing, the Company will deliver to the Shareholder Representatives all such Tax Returns and will permit the Shareholder Representatives to review and comment on each such Tax Return and will make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representatives, if received at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing. Subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 5.10(e) 

       ##### 

  

    

and Article VII, solely and to the extent of available Escrow Funds, the
Shareholders shall be liable for any Taxes shown as due by the Company on the
Tax Returns described in this Section 5.10(a) (except to the extent such
Taxes were specifically included as a liability or reserved against in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital). 

   

 (b) _Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. To the extent that any Tax Returns of the Company relate to any Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date, the Company, at its cost and expense, will prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior Tax Returns of the Company and file or cause to be filed any such Tax Returns. The Company will permit the Shareholder Representatives to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence at least thirty (30) days prior to filing such Tax Returns and will make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representatives. Any Taxes of the Company with respect to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date, (i) to the extent such Taxes were specifically included as a liability or reserved against in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, shall be paid by the Company or (ii) to the extent such Taxes were not included as a liability or not reserved against in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5.10(e) and Article VII, and solely and to the extent of available Escrow Funds, will be a liability of the Shareholders. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date (provided that any Taxes resulting from transactions of the Company and caused by Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date not in the ordinary course of business shall be treated as occurring in the post-closing period). Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date will be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) If any Tax shown as due on any such Tax Return referred to in Section 5.10(a) or 5.10(b) above is required to be borne by the Shareholders (taking into account indemnification obligations hereunder and adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration), (i) such Tax Return will be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, (ii) a draft of each such Tax Return will be provided to the Shareholder Representatives for review and approval not later than thirty (30) days prior to filing (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days of the Closing, as soon as possible following the Closing), and (iii) the Shareholder Representatives will have the right to review and approve such Tax Return prior to the filing of such Tax Return (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

   

 (d) The Company and Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Company for periods commencing after the Closing Date and will be responsible for paying any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns (subject to the indemnification 

       ##### 

  

    

provisions hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, any refunds arising from
losses in periods commencing after the Closing Date shall be for the account
of Parent. 

   

 (e) _Tax Indemnification_. The Parent Parties will be held harmless, solely from and to the extent of the Escrow Funds, against all Losses incurred or sustained by such Persons, or any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, or with respect to or in connection with: 

   

 (i) any liability for Taxes of the Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and the pre-Closing portion of any taxable year or period beginning on or before, and ending after, the Closing Date (under the allocation method set forth in Section 5.10(b)) but only to the extent not included as a specific liability or specifically reserved against in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital; 

  

 (ii) any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than the Company) imposed on the Company as members of the "affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) that arises under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or comparable provisions of foreign, state or local law; 

  

 (iii) any and all Losses arising out of, based upon or relating or attributable to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.10 of this Agreement; and 

  

 (iv) any and all Losses arising out of, based upon or relating or attributable to the breach by the Company or the Shareholder Representatives or the failure by the Company or the Shareholder Representatives to perform (or cause to have performed) any of the covenants made by them or agreements entered into contained in this Section 5.10, Section 5.11, Section 2.10 or Section 4.1(r). 

  

 (f) _Satisfaction of Claims_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 5.10 and Section 5.11 shall govern the procedures for all contests, defenses and indemnification obligations related to or attributable to Taxes; _provided_ , that the obligations of the Parties set forth in this Section 5.10 shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations expressly set forth in this Section 5.10 and in Article VII (though for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in Section 7.3 shall not apply to the indemnification for Taxes in this Section 5.10). 

  

 (ii) Claims by the Parent Parties for Losses pursuant to Section 5.10 shall be satisfied exclusively through the Escrow Account as provided under Section 7.4(a), including the limitation for Specified Matters set forth therein. 

  

 (g) _Transfer Taxes_. The Shareholders solely from and to the extent of the Escrow Funds, on the one hand, and Parent on the other hand, shall be responsible for the timely payment of, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against, half of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, and registration Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Shareholder Representatives shall prepare 

       ##### 

  

    

and file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each party shall cooperate
with the other and take any action reasonably requested by the other party
which does not cause such other party to incur more than de minimus out of
pocket cost in order to minimize such Transfer Taxes. 

   

 (h) For purposes of Section 5.10(e)(i), any Tax Asset included as an asset in Closing Net Working Capital shall not be taken into account in determining Parents indemnification right for liability for pre-Closing Taxes under Section 5.10(e)(i). 

  

 5.11 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent, the Company and the Shareholder Representatives will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of all Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes; _provided_ , that the Shareholder Representatives shall not be obligated to incur (directly or indirectly, on behalf of themselves or the Shareholders) more than de minimus out of pocket cost in doing so. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other parties request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, Tax Return, litigation or other proceeding, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and using commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Tax liabilities of the Company resulting from any claim or assertion by any Governmental Entity, or any voluntary disclosure or other filing by Parent or the Company with any Governmental Entity. Parent and the Company agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the relevant taxable periods (and any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. 

   

 (b) Except in connection with an audit resolved pursuant to Section 5.11(c) (including consistent correlative adjustments for non-audited taxable periods), neither Parent, the Company nor any Affiliate thereof may amend a Tax Return filed by the Company or file or amend any Tax election of the Company, in each case, for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that would result in a Tax liability for which the Shareholders, directly or indirectly (including through the Escrow Account), would be responsible under Section 5.10, without the consent of the Shareholder Representatives, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Parent will, upon request by the Shareholder Representatives, and at its sole expense, cooperate in the preparation of and submission to the proper Governmental Entity of any such amended Tax Return which is required to cause such Tax Return to be consistent with adjustments to the Tax Returns of the Company for any other taxable period proposed by any Governmental Entity, or to give effect to an allowable loss carryback or carryover from a taxable period of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) If the Company or Parent receives any notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment relating to the Company which may give rise to liability of the Shareholders hereunder, the Company or Parent, as applicable, will promptly notify the Shareholder Representatives, within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such notice. The parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other parties hereto informed on a regular basis 

      ##### 

  

    

regarding the status of any Tax audit or proceeding to the extent that such
audit or proceeding could affect a liability of such other parties or the
Shareholders (including indemnity obligations hereunder). The Shareholder
Representatives will have the right to represent the Companys interests in
any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding and to employ counsel
of the Shareholder Representatives choice, but reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, at Shareholders expense, but only to the extent such audit or other
proceeding pertains to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and provided further, that the Shareholder Representatives must first submit
written confirmation to Parent of the Shareholders indemnification obligation
for such Taxes to the extent of the Escrow Funds. Parent will have the right
to participate in such proceeding at its own expense, and will be entitled to
control the disposition of any issue involved in such proceeding which does
not affect a potential liability of the Shareholders. Parent and the
Shareholder Representatives will be entitled to represent their own interests
(or with respect to the Shareholder Representatives, the Shareholders
interests) in light of their responsibilities (including direct or indirect
indemnity obligations) for the related Taxes, at their own expense, in any
audit or administrative or judicial proceedings involving a taxable period
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder Representatives will not agree to any settlement
for any taxable period that reasonably could be expected to affect the Tax
liabilities of Parent or the Company for any taxable period beginning on or
after the Closing Date without prior written consent of Parent, not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall make any voluntary disclosure or similar filing on behalf of
the Company to any Governmental Entity that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Tax liability or current payment obligation for which the
Shareholders, directly or indirectly (including through the Escrow Account),
would be responsible under Section 5.10 without first providing the
Shareholder Representatives at least ten (10) Business Days advance notice
and an opportunity to consult with Parent and the Company regarding such
voluntary disclosure or filing. 

   

 (d) Parent covenants that it will not and will not cause or permit the Company or any Affiliate of Parent to (i) take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption which would result in any Tax liability to the Shareholders, or (ii) make any election or deemed election under Section 338 of the Code that will be applicable to the Merger or amend any Tax Return filed by the Company for any period that includes or ends prior to the Closing Date and that would result in a Tax liability for which the Shareholders, directly or indirectly (including through the Escrow Account), would be responsible under Section 5.10, in each case, unless Parent shall have received the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representatives, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 5.12 _Reasonable Efforts; HSR Act Matters_. 

  

 (a) Each party agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to (i) obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all filings with and give all notices to any Governmental Entity (including those required by the HSR Act) or any other public or private third parties required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide such other information and communications to such Governmental Entities or other public or private Persons as the other party or such Governmental 

       ##### 

  

    

Entities or other public or private Persons may reasonably request in
connection therewith, (iii) consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including the satisfaction of all conditions
hereto; (iv) defend against any claims or actions challenging this Agreement
or the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking
to have vacated or reversed any order issued by a Governmental Entity); and
(v) execute and deliver such additional instruments as may be necessary to
complete the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 5.12(a) will require any party hereto to take any action, or to
refrain from taking any action, pursuant to the HSR Act, the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal
or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ")
which is addressed in the remainder of this Section 5.12. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company, as applicable, will (i) make or cause to be made the filings required of such party to this Agreement under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days from the date of this Agreement, and request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or other materials received by such party to this Agreement from the United States Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such transactions, (iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing (including, if requested by the other party, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity under the Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction and (iv) subject to Section 5.12(c), use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws, each party to this Agreement will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or its Affiliates (i) to initiate, pursue or defend any litigation (or threatened litigation) to which any such Governmental Entity is a party; (ii) to agree or otherwise become subject to any material limitations on (A) the right of Parent or its Affiliates effectively to control or operate the business of the Company after the Closing or the business or operations of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, (B) the right of Parent or its Affiliates to acquire or hold the Company or (C) the right of Parent to exercise full rights of ownership of the Company; or (iii) to agree or otherwise be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), divest itself of or become subject to any restrictions or 

     ##### 

 

  

conditions with respect to all or any portion of the business, assets or
operations of Parent, any Affiliate of Parent or the Company. 

   

 (d) Any filing fees incurred with respect to requests for consent or approval or other filings or notifications required pursuant to the Antitrust Laws shall be borne by Parent. 

   

 5.13 _Release of Liens_. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws prior to the Effective Time to secure evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the Companys sole and exclusive ownership of the "BOSTON PROPER" Trademark registrations (U.S. Reg. Nos. 1,201,644 and 1,750,625), and record ownership thereof in the name solely of the Company, free and clear of all Liens. 

  

 5.14 _Closing Date Actions_. Parent covenants that it will not and will not cause or permit the Company to (i) take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice of the Company prior to the Effective Time, (ii) on the Closing Date, distribute Company Cash or any other assets of the Company, make dividends, incur Company Debt or make cash payments to, incur Liabilities from or enter into transactions with, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent or with any other Person that is not in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice of the Company prior to the Effective Time; or (iii) take or fail to take any action that would result in a reduction of Company Cash, an increase in Closing Net Debt or a decrease in Closing Net Working Capital on the Closing Date except for payments by the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice of the Company prior to the Effective Time or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 7.3 _Indemnification Claims_. 

  

 (a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.3(a), a Parent Party may not recover any Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until one or more Officers Certificates identifying such Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i) in excess, in the aggregate, of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") has or have been delivered to the Shareholder Representatives and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.3(b), in which case, subject to the provisions of this Article VII, such Parent Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified in excess of the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Parent Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 7.2(a), (B) Losses resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Sections 2.2, 2.4 or 2.20(a) through 2.20(e) and (C) Losses related to Taxes pursuant to Sections 5.10. 

   

 (b) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.2, the party claiming indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the party from whom the indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (which if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Party, such Officers Certificate shall be sent to the Shareholder Representatives and the Escrow Agent) at any time on or before 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the Survival Date. If the Indemnified Party is a Parent Party, unless the Shareholder Representatives shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.3(c) for any claim made against the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall, on the thirty-first (31st) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate (or, if prior to such time the Shareholder Representatives provide affirmative written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release such funds, promptly after its receipt of such instructions from the Shareholder Representatives), deliver to the Parent Party from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate. If the Indemnified Party is a Company Party, unless Parent shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.3(c) for any claim made against Parent, on 

       ##### 

  

    

the thirty-first (31st) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate,
Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the Officers Certificate and shall
be obligated to promptly pay to the applicable Company Party hereunder an
amount equal to the Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate.
Any payment from the Escrow Account to Parent Parties shall be made in cash
and shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Shareholders based
on their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Amount. For the purposes
hereof, " _Officer s Certificate_" shall mean a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent, if the Indemnified Party, or the Shareholder
Representatives, if a Shareholder is the Indemnified Party (A) stating that
an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued
Losses, (B) specifying the amount of such Losses, and (C) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant
to which such item is related, including whether or not it is a Specified
Matter. 

   

 (c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No payment shall be made under Section 7.3(b) if the Indemnifying Party shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (an " _Objection Notice_ "), and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Indemnified Party, and the Escrow Agent if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Party, prior to 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Officers Certificate. 

   

 (d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.3(c), the Shareholder Representatives and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnified Party is a Parent Party and if the Shareholder Representatives and Parent should so agree, joint written instructions setting forth such agreement, including the amounts which the Shareholder Representatives and Parent agree should be released from the Escrow Account, shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such joint written instructions and make distributions from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.3(c) or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to this Article VII, either Parent or the Shareholder Representatives may pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law, and the Escrow Agent shall only distribute funds thereafter pursuant to joint written instructions as described in Section 7.3(d)(i) or a final non-appealable court order from a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notification (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party (which if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Party, such Third Party Claim Notice shall be sent to the Shareholder Representatives and the Escrow Agent) of such claim after it becomes aware of such Third Party Claim specifying the nature of such Third Party Claim and the amount 

     ##### 

  

    

or estimated amount thereof, together with copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) served on or received by such Indemnified Party,
which notice must be identified as a "Third Party Claim Notice"; _provided_ ,
that the failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the rights
of such Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced thereby. If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim
which Losses would be payable from the Escrow Funds, the Shareholder
Representatives shall have the right to assume the entire control of the
defense, compromise or settlement of such claim or demand (including the
selection of counsel), subject to the right of the Indemnified Party to
participate (with counsel of its choice, but the fees and expenses of such
additional counsel shall solely be at the expense of the Indemnified Party).
The Indemnifying Party will not compromise or settle any such action, suit,
proceeding, claim or demand (other than, after consultation with Indemnified
Party, an action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand to be settled solely by
the payment of money damages and/or the granting of releases, provided that
no such settlement or release shall acknowledge any liability by the
Indemnified Party) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice (or ceases in
good faith to continue the defense), then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to the entire control of the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim (including the selection of counsel), subject to the
right of the Indemnifying Party to participate (with counsel of its choice,
but the fees and expenses of such additional counsel shall solely be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party), and the Indemnified Party will not
compromise or settle any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The parties hereto
that are not conducting the defense shall provide the party conducting the
defense and its counsel with reasonable access during normal business hours
to such parties records and personnel relating to any Third Party Claim and
shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with the party conducting the defense in
the defense or settlement thereof. 

   

 7.4 _Maximum Payments; Remedy; Limitations on Indemnity_. 

  

 (a) The maximum aggregate amount for which the Parent Parties may recover pursuant to Section 5.10, this Article VII and Section 1.10, in the aggregate, shall be limited to the amounts held in the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.4(b), in no case may a Parent Party seek recourse directly against any Securityholder for indemnification hereunder or for any amounts owed on behalf of the Shareholders under Section 1.10. No indemnification shall be payable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any claims asserted by such Indemnified Party after the Survival Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the Survival Date an Officers Certificate is delivered alleging Losses and a claim for recovery under Sections 7.2 and 7.3(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the Survival Date until such claim is fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount that the Parent Parties may recover and for which the Shareholders shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Parties (including through the Escrow Account) pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any or all of the Specified Matters shall be limited to $3,500,000. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any party in respect of Losses arising out of any fraud on the part of such party (it is agreed and understood that the Survival Date and the Threshold Amount shall not apply in respect of any such Losses). 

   

 (c) If any Indemnified Party collects an amount in discharge of a claim in respect of a Loss pursuant to this Article VII and such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) subsequently recovers (by payment of cash) from a third party a sum which is related to that claim in respect of a Loss pursuant to this Article VII such that the Indemnified Party has received an amount in connection therewith in excess of its related Losses (such excess recovery, the " _Excess Recovery_ "), such Indemnified Party shall (or, as appropriate, shall procure that such Affiliate shall) forthwith repay to the Indemnifying Party or Parties (including, if applicable, by remitting such amount to the Escrow Agent for inclusion in the Escrow Account) an amount equal to the Excess Recovery less any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in procuring the Excess Recovery (but no more than the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII). 

   

 (d) In the event any Losses by a Parent Party are covered by insurance or any indemnity, contribution or other similar right against a third party, each Parent Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance or indemnity, contribution or similar right. The amount of Losses otherwise recoverable under Section 7.2(a) shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar cash payment actually received by the Indemnified Parties from any third party with respect thereto. 

   

 (e) Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Third Party Claims to which the payment related. Without limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights. 

   

 (f) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including responding to such claims or liabilities in the same manner as the applicable party would respond to such claims or liabilities in the absence of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) Any Losses for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VII shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

   

 (h) The Parent Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII with respect to any amount resulting in a claim to the extent that such amount is reflected in the calculation of Final Adjusted Net Merger Consideration. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (i) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of any party hereto, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (j) Unless otherwise required by Law, all indemnity payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes. 

   

 7.5 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to those contained in Sections 5.10 and this Article VII, and such indemnification rights shall be the exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Effective Time with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith.

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent, contemporaneously with notice of termination thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable, the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which Parent and Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any of its assets, or against any of its directors, officers, employees and stockholders with respect to this 

      #####

Except for nonpayment of the Parent Termination Fee, the parties hereby agree that, upon termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable, in no event shall the Company (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive damages.

foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement or any
Shareholder Representative Related Agreement. Michael W. Tiernan shall serve
as the " _Primary Shareholder Representative_ " and Kenneth C. Fischer shall
serve as the " _Secondary Shareholder Representative_ ". Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Related Agreement: (A) any decision, determination, act,
consent, instruction, notice or authorization of the
Shareholder Representatives under this Agreement or any Related Agreement to
which the Shareholder Representatives are parties shall require the Primary
Shareholder Representative to authorize such decision, determination, act,
consent, instruction, notice or authorization, and upon such authorization by

Representatives may be changed by the Securityholders from time to time upon
not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Shareholder Representative may be removed unless
Shareholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of at 66.67% agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted Shareholder Representative,
who shall succeed in the same capacity, as either Primary Shareholder
Representative or Secondary Shareholder Representative, as the replaced
Shareholder Representative. A Shareholder Representative may resign as
Shareholder Representative at any time upon written notice to the other
Shareholder Representative or to the Shareholders. A vacancy in any position
of Shareholder Representative may be filled by Shareholders with an aggregate
Pro Rata Portion of greater than 50%, and such replacement Shareholder

Shareholder Representative party hereto in lieu of such replaced Shareholder
Representative. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Representatives,
and the Shareholder Representatives shall not receive any compensation for

Shareholder Representatives shall constitute notice to or from the
Securityholders.

retained by the Shareholder Representative (" _Shareholder Representative

Shareholder Representatives of funds released under the Escrow Agreement for
distribution to Shareholders). A decision, determination, act, consent,
instruction, notice or authorization of the Shareholder Representatives,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement or any
Shareholder Representative Related Agreement, shall constitute a decision of
the Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Securityholders; and Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representatives as being the
