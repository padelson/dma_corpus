Directors_ ") has unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into

the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the  Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), including Section 251 of
the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the

(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 5.10_ , at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

-2- ARTICLE II.

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

(i) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.50
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.50 per share, of
the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is owned by Parent or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), other than, in each case, shares of Company Common Stock held on
behalf of third parties, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_
"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common

 



-3-  Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who
has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal (the "
_Appraisal Provisions_ ") of their shares of Company Common Stock has demanded
appraisal under the Appraisal Provisions with respect to any issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Dissenting Stockholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), to the extent the Appraisal
Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ , but shall be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth
in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its
demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of
appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each Dissenting Share shall
thereupon be treated as though such share of Company Common Stock had been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (but in any
event within 48 hours of receipt thereof) of any demands for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
payment agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying AgentÂ’s
responsibilities under this Agreement.

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such aggregate Merger Consideration, the "
_Payment Fund_ ").

 



-4- (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the
third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate) (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to any such
transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section
2.2(d)_ , without interest. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying
Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ , and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company

 



-5-  Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any interest
or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand.

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for six months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares that has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ without any
interest thereon.

 

(h) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be
paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount
as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent
to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section 2.2(g)_ ,
Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



-6- Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program_ _._

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding
as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no
later than fifteen calendar days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment
(without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time and (ii) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option with an exercise price equal
to or in excess of the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled by virtue of
the Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without
any payment to the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, each Company Option granted after the date of the Agreement,
whether or not vested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into an option to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including vesting (and any applicable
accelerated vesting), a number of shares of Parent common stock equal to
the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) at a price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) of Parent common stock equal to the price per share under
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio (each Company Option, as so adjusted, an "
_Adjusted Option_ "). " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the
quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing the Merger
Consideration by the volume weighted average trading price of Parent common
stock for the five consecutive trading days ending with, and including, the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each time-vesting restricted stock unit award
granted by the Company in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company RSU Award_ ") and each performance-based restricted stock unit award
granted by the Company in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as
practicable (but no later than fifteen calendar days) following the Effective
Time, a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes)
with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award as
of the Effective Time (with respect to each Company PSU Award, such number of
shares shall be determined, in accordance with the applicable award terms, by
assuming the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals
in respect of fiscal years during the performance period that are completed
prior to the Effective Time and the target level of achievement of the
applicable performance goals in respect of all other fiscal years during the
performance period) and (ii) the Merger Consideration;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent that any such Company RSU Award or Company PSU
Award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code, such cash payment shall be paid in 

 



-7-  accordance with the applicable awardÂ’s terms and at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the
application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award
granted after the date of this Agreement that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent
restricted stock unit award with the same terms and conditions, including
vesting (and any applicable accelerated vesting), as were applicable to such
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to
the number of shares of Parent common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
number of shares) equal to the product of (a) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,
multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each
Company RSU Award, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted RSU Award_ ").

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restrictions pursuant to an award granted by the
Company (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, vest in full and become free of restrictions
and shall be cancelled and converted automatically, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right of the holder to
receive the Merger Consideration (less applicable withholding Taxes).

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take the actions necessary
to effectuate the following: (i) cause the Company Stock Purchase Program
provided through Computershare Shareowner Services (the " _Stock Purchase
Program_ "), to be terminated subject to, and effective as of immediately
prior to, the Effective Time and (ii) cause all accumulated employee payroll
deductions held pursuant to the Stock Purchase Program as of the Effective
Time to be refunded to employees as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board of Directors
or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.3_, and shall provide notices to holders of
Company Options regarding the treatment of Company Options pursuant to this 
_Section 2.3_. As of no later than the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 (or other applicable form)
with respect to the shares of Parent common stock subject to the Adjusted
Options and Adjusted RSU Awards, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSU Awards remain outstanding.

 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.7(d)_ , if at any time
before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes
or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances
are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time,
then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Company and their
respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

occurred through the CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ action or inaction

representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.10_, no state "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "supermajority," "affiliate
transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or other anti-
takeover or similar Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) is applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by

necessary to render all potentially applicable Takeover Statutes and anti-

this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 3.20 _Insurance_. Except as has not had or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, (a) all insurance policies and surety bonds carried by or covering the

together with adequately capitalized self-insured arrangements, provide
coverage in such amounts and with respect to such risks and losses as is
customary for the industries in which the Company and its

determined to be adequate for the respective businesses and operations of the
Companies and its Subsidiaries; (b) the Insurance Policies are in full force

consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practices. To the knowledge of the Company,
as of the date hereof, there is no reason that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will not be able to (a) renew its existing Insurance Policies as
and when such policies expire or (b) obtain comparable coverage from insurers
as may be necessary to continue its business without a significant increase in
cost.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ ") ( _provided_ that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection to the extent
that the relevance of any disclosed event, item or occurrence in such section

Section 4.1 _Organization_. Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. Merger Sub
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed,
and has all necessary governmental approvals, to do business and (where such
concept is recognized) is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; Consents and
Approvals; No Violation_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Financing. The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and

 



-28-  Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by each of them of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Financing, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate action or proceedings on
the part of either Parent or Merger Sub, or other vote of ParentÂ’s or Merger
SubÂ’s stockholders, is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Financing. The
Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s (as the case may be) stockholders and
(ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of Parent
and Merger Sub and is enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with the Transaction
Approvals, no authorization, consent, order, license, permit or approval of,
or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity
is required to be made or obtained, under applicable Law, for the consummation
by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, except for such authorizations, consents,
orders, licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, declarations, notices and
filings that are not required to be made or obtained prior to the consummation
of such transactions or that the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does
not, and (assuming the Transaction Approvals are obtained) the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, and
compliance with the provisions hereof will not, (i) result in any loss, or
suspension, limitation or impairment of any right of Parent or Merger Sub to
own or use any assets required for the conduct of their business or result in
any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, first
offer, first refusal, modification or acceleration of, or trigger the grant
of any material rights or material change to the payment terms under, any
obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan, guarantee of
indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, Contract, instrument, Permit, concession, franchise, right or
license binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or by which or to which any of their
respective properties, rights or assets are bound or subject or result in the
creation of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any of
the properties or assets of the Parent or Merger Sub, except for any of the
foregoing as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) conflict with or

the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



-29- Section 4.3 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2015,

Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has timely filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports
required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since December 31, 2015
(all such forms, documents and reports filed or furnished by Parent since such
date, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment (and, in the case
of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the
Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC Documents, contained any

schedules) of Parent included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
SEC Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the

the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that are not
material and to any other adjustments described therein, including the notes
thereto), (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of

basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto), and (iii) comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. As of the date of

matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

been, in compliance with all Laws. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
since December 31, 2014, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice or, to ParentÂ’s knowledge, other communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or alleged failure to comply
with or violation of any Law in a material respect.

 



-30- Section 4.6 _Parent and Merger Sub Information_. The information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time any such document is
filed with the SEC, amended or supplemented, or first published, sent or
provided to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is
made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.

Section 4.7 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
neither Parent nor any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who would be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

Section 4.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
the fully executed debt commitment letter, together with any related fee
letters (in the case of the fee letters, redacted in a customary manner),
dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and between Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and Parent providing for debt financing as described therein
(together, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes, the " _Commitment
Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has agreed to lend the
amounts set forth therein, for the purpose of, among other things, paying the
Merger Amounts.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, other than the conditions precedent set forth the Commitment Letter
(such conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ ").

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained
therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and
no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, other than
mandatory reductions expressly contemplated thereby.

 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company made to Parent such that
the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ is satisfied, assuming the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ are satisfied, and assuming the
CompanyÂ’s compliance with its obligations under this Agreement such that the
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ is satisfied, Parent has no reason to
believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or
prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.

party that would be reasonably likely to affect the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter in any respect, other than those set forth in the
Commitment Letter.

(g) Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees and amounts required by the Commitment Letter to be
paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

(h) In each case, regardless of whether the Adjusted Per Share Price or the
Baseline Per Share Price is the Per Share Price and regardless of any actions
taken or committed to be taken by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
_Section 5.7_ , Parent will have at and as of the Closing Date sufficient
available funds to consummate the Merger and to make all payments required to
be made in connection therewith, including payment of the Merger
Consideration, any payments made in respect of equity compensation obligations
to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the
payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled,
terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger

be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or
discharged in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) and all premiums and fees required to be paid in
connection therewith and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the Merger (such amounts,
collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that the representation contained
in the immediately preceding sentence will not be true at and as of the
Closing Date. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter) by
or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

As at the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value of $0.50 per share, all of

hereunder and matters ancillary thereto and has and prior to the Effective
Time will have no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

its Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time during the period commencing
three years prior to the date hereof through the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as such term is defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL.

 

Section 4.11 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by Law, the organizational documents of Parent or the applicable
rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded in order for
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Financing.

Section 4.12 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article III_ , each of Parent and Merger Sub
agrees and acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on behalf of
the Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with

comment on the communication; _provided_ that the Company may make any such
communications without prior review and comment from Parent if its content is
consistent with information contained in any previously issued press release,
public announcement or public filing, or any other communication previously

Time, to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel, properties, contracts,
commitments, Tax Returns, books and records and such other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (B) coordinated through the
General Counsel of the Company or a designee thereof.

 



-38- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2_,
no party to this Agreement nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or
information, if doing so would, in such partyÂ’s and its outside legal
counselÂ’s reasonable judgment, (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with any (A) Law
applicable to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or
operation of the business, of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or (B)
Contract to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their assets or properties are bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
such instances such party shall inform the other party of the general nature
of the information being withheld and, upon the other partyÂ’s request,
reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in
whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes
described in the foregoing _clauses_ _(i)_ and _(ii)_.

(c) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them
or their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality

" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, and shall direct each of its financial
advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to not, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer, including any proposal or
offer to its stockholders, that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any information in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal (other
than, solely in response to an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal, to
ascertain facts from the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board of Directors informing itself about such
Company Takeover Proposal and the Person that made it and to refer the
inquiring Person to this _Section 5.3_ and to limit its conversation or
other communication exclusively to such referral and such ascertaining of
facts), or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve,
recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document,
agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries or
Representatives acting by or on behalf of the Company shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

(b) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Merger
Sub) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall (i) use reasonable 

 



-39-  best efforts to enforce to the fullest extent, and (ii) not release any
third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any agreement to which the
Company is a party or (y) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to
which the Company is a party; _provided_ that if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any
such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third
party to make a Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of Directors.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_
or _(b)_ , if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company
receives a _bona fide_ written __ Company Takeover Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_, and if the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (i)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person that has made such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall substantially
concurrently with the delivery to such Person provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives unless such
non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and (ii) engage
in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company takes any of
the actions in _clauses _ _(i)_ and _(ii)_ above.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after
receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal,
inquiry or request for information or discussions relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the
Person making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or
request and the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event
more often than once every 48 hours), as to the status of (including any
material developments related thereto) such Company Takeover Proposal, offer,
proposal, inquiry or request, it being understood that the Company shall also
provide Parent with copies of any draft agreements to the extent that any such
draft is or would reasonably be expected to be material to the ability of
Parent to exercise its rights to propose revisions to this Agreement pursuant
to the proviso in _Section 5.3(f)_. The Company will not enter into any
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, neither the Company
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof, nor group of directors, formally
or informally,

 



-40-  acting intentionally and publicly, either directly or indirectly, in a
manner materially inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, shall (i) (A)
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or resolve to or
publicly propose or announce its intention to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company,
or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this _clause _ _(i)_ being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement),
commitment or agreement in principle with respect to, or that is intended or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or resolve,
publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company
Vote is obtained, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if (1) such action is taken in response to an
Intervening Event and (2) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(x) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor, and (y) upon the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Company Board of DirectorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith,
after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that a written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board of Directors may, subject
to compliance with this _Section 5.3(f)_, (x) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(f)_ in order to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal subject to paying the
Company Termination Fee, which shall be paid prior to or concurrently with
such termination in accordance with _Section 7.3_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to so making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously
provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreements, (B) at the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any

 



-41-  revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (C) in the event of
any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms and conditions
of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in 
_clause _ _(A)_ above of this proviso and a new notice period under _clause
_ _(A)_ of this proviso shall commence ( _provided_ that the notice period
thereunder shall only be two Business Days) during which time the Company
shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_
anew with respect to such additional notice, including _clauses _ _(A)_
through _(C)_ above of this proviso.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that (i) if such disclosure does not
reaffirm the Company Recommendation or state that the Company Recommendation
remains unchanged, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (ii) the Company Board of Directors may not effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless permitted to do so by this 
_Section 5.3_; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any "stop, look and listen" disclosure in and of itself shall
not be considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Nothing contained
in this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed to limit the proviso set forth in
_Section 5.9_.

Section 5.4  _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_. The Company will prepare
and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, and in any event within 20 Business Days (subject to ParentÂ’s
compliance in all material respects with this _Section 5.4_), a Proxy
Statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent a draft of the
Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within 17 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5_ _.3(e)_ , the Company Board of
Directors shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is
required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The
Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that at the date of mailing to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting the
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by
the Company with the SEC

 



-42-  and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company will promptly, and in any event,
within 48 hours, notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information and will promptly provide
to Parent copies of all written correspondence between the Company and/or any
of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Subject to _Section 5.7_ and applicable attorney-client privilege, the
Company and Parent will each use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received
on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company will cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed (i) if the SEC provides comments to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within five Business Days) after the date the SEC staff advises that
it has no further comments thereon or (ii) if, within 10 calendar days after
the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the SEC staff has not
indicated that it expects to have comments to the preliminary Proxy Statement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five Business
Days) after such 10th calendar day.

 

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company
will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders
of Company Common Stock (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (and
in any event no more than 25 Business Days) to consider and vote upon the
adoption of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
but subject to _Section 5.3_, the CompanyÂ’s obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 5.5_ will not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or the Company Board of Directors
making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_,
unless the Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company Board of Directors will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
the Requisite Company Vote at the Stockholders Meeting. Prior to the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, the Company will engage a proxy solicitor that is
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, including by allowing Parent and its
Representatives to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with
such proxy solicitor, in each case, to the extent practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing right for Parent and its Representatives to
participate in meetings or discussions shall not apply from and after a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company may only postpone or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii)
to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting, or (iv) with
the written consent of Parent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and during the one-year period
immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by
Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company
Employees_ "), (i) an annual base salary or wage rate, target and maximum
short-term annual incentive compensation opportunities and target equity-based
incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no less than
those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) during the Continuation Period, the non-discretionary matching
contribution opportunity in effect for each Company Employee under any 401(k)
plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries) (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") in which such
Company Employee participates shall be no less favorable than that in
effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the applicable 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), (B) a profit sharing contribution
shall be made to the applicable Parent 401(k) Plan for each Company Employee
participant in respect of (x) calendar year 2016, if the Effective Time occurs
in such calendar year, and (y) calendar year 2017, in each case based on a
percentage of eligible compensation equal to 8%, and (C) any amounts
calculated in accordance with _clause (B)_ that cannot be contributed to the
applicable Parent 401(k) Plan due to applicable limitations under the Code
shall instead be paid to the applicable Company Employee in a manner
consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practice regarding such excess amounts.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, during the one-year
period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue to
maintain or cause to be maintained, without amendment, the severance plan

and shall provide, or cause to be provided in accordance with the terms of the
Company Severance Plan, to each Company Employee who experiences a severance-
qualifying termination under the Company Severance Plan, the
severance benefits specified in the Company Severance Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such Company Employee is entitled to severance
benefits under an individual severance, employment or similar agreement, such
Company Employee shall receive the severance benefits provided under the
terms of such agreement and not the severance benefits set forth in the
Company Severance Plan.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of
each Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor thereto) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and level of benefits under such Post-Closing Plans; _provided_ that
such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any Post-
Closing Plan that is a defined benefit retirement plan or any Post-Closing
Plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any
benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the same period of service or
(iii) apply for purposes of any plan,

 



-44-  program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y)
that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company
Employee is first eligible to participate during the Continuation Period,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any preexisting
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be
waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(B) credit each Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred
by such Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-
Closing Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect
to any Company Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement
or who are based outside of the United States, ParentÂ’s obligations under this
_Section 5.6_ shall be in addition to, and not in contravention of, any
obligations under the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or under the
Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Company Employees are based.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms, will occur upon the Effective Time.

(e) No later than 30 Business Days following the date hereof, the Company
shall make available to Parent (i) a copy of each material Non-U.S. Company
Benefit Plan, and the most recent summary plan description and actuarial
valuation report relating to such material Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan, to
the extent applicable, and (ii) a list and copies of all Collective Bargaining
Agreements covering employees outside of the United States.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee or other service provider at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this  _Section 5.6_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



-45- Section 5.7 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.7(d)_), prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger as promptly as practicable, including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notifications required
(whether by Law or in order to satisfy the condition set forth in _Section
6.1(c)_) to be filed to consummate the Merger, (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting
period, permit, Order or approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information
and documentary material required under the HSR Act) required to be obtained
or made (whether by Law or in order to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_) by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any
action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defending any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (v) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in
each case, to the extent necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger, and (vi) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required (whether by Law or in order to satisfy
the condition set forth in  _Section 6.1(c)_) consents, authorizations,
Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.7_. In that regard,
prior to the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall promptly (i) consult
with the other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any
necessary information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other parties (or their counsel) with copies of) all notices, submissions or
filings made by or on behalf of such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by or on behalf of such party to,
or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) inform the other parties to this Agreement,
and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case
of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any Substantive
Communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising
and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust consents
or approvals and shall lead and direct all submissions to, meetings and

 



-46-  communications with any Governmental Entity or other party in connection
with antitrust matters, including litigation matters with respect to any
Antitrust Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall participate in
any meeting or Substantive Communication with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
therein or thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement between Parent, the
Company and their respective counsel dated February 3, 2016, Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
5.7(b)_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.7_, materials provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and the Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make or file
with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms, registrations
and notifications required (whether by Law or in order to satisfy the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_) to be filed to consummate the Merger
under any applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings and
subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 5.7(b)_, the Company and
Parent will, respond to inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any
supplemental information that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in
connection with filings made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and
Parent shall file their notification and report forms under the HSR Act ten
Business Days after the date of this Agreement or when advisable. Subject to
_Section 5.7(b)_ and the last sentence of this _Section_ _ _ _5.7(c)_ , in
the event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to any Antitrust Law, including the HSR Act (any such
request pursuant to the HSR Act, a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to,
and to certify compliance with, any such request for information or
documentary material, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate
during the entirety of any review process pursuant to any Antitrust Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, if Parent in good faith
believes it to be necessary or advisable to do so in order to permit the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section
6.1(c)_ or in order to avoid a Triggering Divestiture, elect not to certify
compliance with any such Second Request until the date that is seven months
after the date hereof, but in no event shall Parent delay certification of
compliance with any such Second Request beyond such date that is seven months
after the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
neither Parent nor the Company, without the other partyÂ’s prior written
consent, shall (i) enter into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or
otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of
extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling, beyond the date that
is eleven months after the date hereof, the expiration or termination of the
waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or, (ii) enter into
any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any
arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to complete the Merger
(or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from completing the
Merger) prior to any date that is after the date that is eleven months from
the date hereof.

 



-47- (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, in order to permit the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section 6.1(c)_ as promptly as
practicable (subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.7(d)_), (i)
propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate,
and other disposition of and restriction on the businesses, assets,
properties, product lines, and equity interests of, or changes to the conduct
of business of, the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) and take such action or
actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create,
terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), and (iii) otherwise
take or commit to take any action that would limit ParentÂ’s freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ that any such sales, divestitures,
licenses, holdings, dispositions, restrictions, changes or similar effects are
conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require Parent or the Company to take, or cause to be taken, or commit
to take, or commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture, license, hold
separate, sale or other disposition, of or with respect to (A) assets,
businesses or product lines of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) representing, in the aggregate, in excess of $1,500,000,000.00
of Net Sales or (B) ParentÂ’s "Sherwin-Williams," "Krylon" or "Ronseal"
trademark or trade name or any businesses or product lines using any
such trademarks or trade names, in each case, in any jurisdiction other than
Australia. If requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to any action
contemplated by this _Section 5.7_; _provided_ that any such agreement or
action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company (and the Company shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such
actions without the prior written consent of Parent. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to permit the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section 6.1(c)_ without taking, or causing to be
taken, or committing to take, or committing to cause to be taken, any action
that would constitute a Triggering Divestiture, unless and until the Company
has requested that Parent offer a Triggering Divestiture or Parent reasonably
determines, after communications between Parent and a Governmental Entity to
which the Company was a participant and after further consultation with the
Company, that undertaking a Triggering Divestiture is necessary in order to
permit the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.1(b)_ and
_Section 6.1(c)_ by the End Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the earlier of (x) the date that is nine months after the
date hereof and (y) the commencement by a Governmental Entity of litigation
to prohibit the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall not offer or propose, or cause
to be offered or proposed, that it take, or cause to be taken, or commit to
take, or commit to cause to be taken, any action constituting a Triggering
Divestiture.

 



-48- (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 5.7_, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

 

(f) The parties agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, no filing, notice, approval or clearance pursuant to any
Antitrust Law, other than those set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_, is a condition
to any partyÂ’s obligation to effect the Merger and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, to be subject to requirements imposed by any
takeover statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination
statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws (including
Section 203 of the DGCL) and regulations (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties and that the
parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the
other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public
statement to the extent required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of press
releases or public announcements by the Company or Parent with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal or from and after a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, neither the Company nor Parent shall not be required to consult with
the other but shall give such other party a copy of any such press release or
public announcement prior to the issuance thereof.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in

 



-49-  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees,
as the case may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents
and the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement,
limited liability company agreement or comparable constituent or
organizational documents for each Subsidiary of the Company or in any
agreement set forth on _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(an " _Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the Indemnified
Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as
such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided
by: (i) the Company Organizational Documents or the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited liability
company agreement or comparable constituent or organizational documents for
each Subsidiary of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
(ii) any Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party on the one
hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; and (iii) applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company to, in
each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(including, in each case, any interest or assessments thereon) in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified PartyÂ’s capacity as
a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the expenses of any Indemnified
Party incurred in connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in each case, to the extent that such Persons are indemnified
or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company
Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or comparable
constituent or organizational documents for each Subsidiary of the Company,
any Indemnity Agreement or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
(and local counsel in each necessary jurisdiction) with respect to each such
matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties.

(c) For a period of six years after the Closing and at all times subject to
applicable Law, Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving
Company or any its Subsidiaries or any of ParentÂ’s other Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to) amend or modify in any way adverse to the Indemnified Parties,
or to the beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation and indemnification
provisions set forth in the organizational documents of the Surviving Company
or its Subsidiaries to make them less favorable to the Indemnified Parties or
the beneficiaries 

 



-50-  thereof than the provisions which are currently provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent will obtain, or cause the Surviving
Company to obtain, for a period of not less than six years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the CompanyÂ’s
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policy with an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ that
Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy
which, in its good faith determination, provides the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, and at ParentÂ’s request
shall, purchase a "tail" directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and
indemnification policy; _provided_ that payment for insurance coverage
provided by such "tail" directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policy shall not
exceed 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company.
Any such "tail" directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policy will satisfy
ParentÂ’s obligations under this _Section 5.10(c)_ to obtain DandO Insurance.

(d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs and representatives.

 

(e) This _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the
event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that such other Person or the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper, in each case, regardless of whether the
Adjusted Per Share Price or the Baseline Per Share Price is the Per Share
Price, to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including using

 



-51-  reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and
any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and comply with its obligations
thereunder; (ii) satisfy or if applicable use reasonable best efforts to
cause to be satisfied (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on
a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Financing (including the
Financing Conditions) set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements; and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive debt
financing agreements on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated
by the Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions)
(the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "). Upon the reasonable request
of the Company, Parent shall provide the Company information in reasonable
detail about the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter and any other financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice of any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact
on the Financing necessary to pay the Merger Amount contemplated by the
Commitment Letter.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement or other
modification of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements
if such termination, amendment, replacement or modification (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions
or other terms or otherwise modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (x) delay or prevent the Closing or (y) make the timely funding of the
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing
materially less likely to occur, other than, in each case, (A) a waiver of any
closing conditions by lender(s) or their agent or (B) to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or to reassign titles to
such parties who had executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof.
Upon any such amendment, replacement or modification, the term "Commitment
Letter" and "Definitive Debt Financing Agreement" shall mean the Commitment
Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended,
replaced or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such amendment, replacement or other modification of the Commitment
Letter.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (b) above to the contrary, in
addition to the rights of Parent set forth in clause (b) above, Parent shall
have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity offerings or
debt offerings or incurrences of debt for all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under
the Commitment Letter; _provided_ that (i) to the extent any such equity or
debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not
exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement and the End Date and (ii) the
conditions to the use of such proceeds to pay the Merger Amounts shall be no
more restrictive than the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter.

 

(d) If all or any portion of the Financing necessary for Parent to pay the
Merger Amount becomes unavailable, then Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same
and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
pay the Merger Amounts. In the event any alternative financing is obtained

 



-52-  in accordance with this _Section 5.12(d)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "),
references in this Agreement to the Financing shall also be deemed to refer to
such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or
definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered
into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and
definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and
all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall be applicable
thereto to the same extent as ParentÂ’s obligations with respect to the
Financing.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
employee, attorneys, accountants and other Representatives to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide all customary cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent that is necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating the Financing and any other financing or refinancing transactions
undertaken by Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger,
in each case, to the extent such cooperation is customarily provided for
financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) make one or more members of senior management
of the Company available, for a reasonable number of meetings or telephone
calls, at reasonable times and locations mutually agreed, and upon reasonable
notice, to participate in the preparation of customary offering and
syndication documents and materials, including registration statements,
prospectuses and prospectus supplements, private placement or offering
memoranda, bank information memoranda, bank syndication material and packages,
lender and investor presentations, rating agency materials and presentations,
and similar documents and materials, in connection with the marketing efforts
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Financing Sources related to the Financing (all
such documents and materials, collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "),
(B) furnish to Parent all Company Information as may be reasonably requested
by Parent to assist in the preparation of the Offering Documents or in
connection with the syndication and marketing of the Financing, (C)
provide information that is reasonably available or readily obtainable
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to assist
Parent in preparing pro forma financial statements required by SEC Regulation
S-X for registered offerings of securities in connection with the Financing,
(D) make one or more members of senior management of the Company available for
a reasonable number of meetings or telephone calls, at reasonable times and
locations mutually agreed, and upon reasonable notice, in due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions, management presentations, rating agency
presentations, lender meetings (including one-on-one meetings) and one or more
road shows related to the Financing, (E) assist Parent in obtaining
any corporate credit and family ratings and, if applicable, facility ratings
from any ratings agency relating to the Financing, (F) request the CompanyÂ’s
independent auditors to cooperate with ParentÂ’s independent auditors,
participate in accounting due diligence sessions and provide accountantÂ’s
comfort letters and consents, (G) assist in the preparation of Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements and related definitive documents, including guarantees
(if required) and other certificates and documents as may be requested by
Parent, (H) provide authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing
the distribution of information provided by the Company to prospective lenders
containing a representation to the Financing Sources that the information
provided by the Company for inclusion in the public side versions of such
documents, if any, does not include material non-public information about the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective securities and (I) provide at
least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing all documentation
and other

 



-53-  information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent reasonably
requested at least ten Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing.

(f) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct offers to purchase or
exchange, and conduct consent solicitations with respect to, any or all of the
outstanding series of senior notes of the Company (the " _Company Notes_ "),
on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms and amendments to the
terms and provisions of the applicable indenture, that are specified, from
time to time, by Parent (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the "
_Debt Offers_ ") and which are permitted by the terms of such Company Notes,
the applicable indentures and applicable Law, including SEC rules and
regulations; _provided_ that any such Debt Offer shall be consummated
substantially simultaneously with or after the Closing using funds provided
by Parent. Parent shall consult with the Company regarding the material terms
and conditions of any Debt Offer, including the timing and commencement of any
Debt Offer and any tender deadlines. Parent shall not be permitted
to commence any Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided the Company with
the necessary offer to purchase, consent solicitation statement, letter of
transmittal or press release, if any, in connection with the Debt Offer
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in
advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its
counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents. In addition,
Parent shall not be permitted to commence any Debt Offer until the date that
is 60 days prior to the first date on which the Company and Parent reasonably
expect the Closing may occur. The closing of the Debt Offers shall be
expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing. Subject to _Section
5.12(g)_ , the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers,

reasonable best efforts to provide all reasonable cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any Debt Offer (including, to the
extent required by the policies or procedures of the Depository Trust
Company (" _DTC_ ") in connection with any consent solicitation that is part
of any Debt Offer, the Company conducting any such consent solicitation);
_provided_ that neither the Company nor counsel for the Company shall be
required to furnish any legal opinions or negative assurance letters in
connection with the Debt Offers (other than, in connection with any consent
solicitation conducted by the Company, the Company using reasonable best
efforts to deliver and to cause counsel for the Company to deliver, customary
legal opinions, to the extent such opinions would not conflict with applicable
Law and would be accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time
delivered). The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers will be
selected by Parent after consultation with the Company and their fees and out-
of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(b)_ , as it applies to the CompanyÂ’s obligations under this
_Section 5.12(f)_ , shall be deemed satisfied.

 

(g) No obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants or
other Representatives under any certificate, document or instrument delivered
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ , including in respect of any Debt Offer
(other than any authorization letters delivered pursuant to
_Section 5.12(e)(G),_ any Form W-9 delivered pursuant to _Section 5.12(e)(I)_
, and any certificate,

 



-54-  document or instrument reasonably required by DTC or any dealer manager,
solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in
connection with any consent solicitation that is part of any Debt Offer)
shall be required to be effective until the Effective Time. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12_ or in _Section 5.13_ to the
contrary, in fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 5.12_ ,
including in respect of any Debt Offer, or _Section 5.13_ , (i) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents or other Representatives shall be required to (w)
pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any Liability
or obligation in connection with the Financing or any other financing or
refinancing transactions undertaken by Parent or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger prior to the Effective Time, except such expenses
for which Parent is obligated to reimburse the Company or, if reasonably
requested by the Company, for which funds that are actually necessary to pay
such expenses are provided in advance by Parent to the Company, (x) take or
permit the taking of any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without lapse
of time, or both) under, the Company Organizational Documents or
the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any
applicable Law or material contracts of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (y) pass resolutions or consents or approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing or the definitive financing arrangements or any
Debt Offer or any Debt Offer Documents (other than to the extent required by
_Section 5.12(f)_ and by the reasonable requirements of any dealer manager,
solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in
connection with the Debt Offers in connection with any consent solicitations
that are part of the Debt Offers), or (z) provide any cooperation that, in the
opinion of the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) Parent shall
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ or _Section 5.13_
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the costs of the preparation of any annual or quarterly financial
statements). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred
by them in connection with (1) the Financing and any other financing or
refinancing transactions undertaken by Parent or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger (other than to the extent resulting from
information provided to Parent in writing by the Company or
its Subsidiaries), except in the event such loss or damage arises out of or
results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ or  _Section 5.13_ and (2) any Debt Offers. Subject to
ParentÂ’s indemnification obligations under this _Section 5.12_ , the Company
hereby consents to the use of all of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ corporate logos
in connection with the initial syndication or marketing of such Financing;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter) by or to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing transaction, or the commencement or
consummation of a Debt Offer with respect to any series of Company Notes, be a
condition to any of ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s obligations hereunder.

 



-55- Section 5.13 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices
and to take all other reasonable actions to cause (a) the repayment in full on
the Closing Date (or in the case of any letters of credit, cash
collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into an
alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) of all amounts and other
obligations then outstanding under and (b) the termination (to the extent
provided therein and pursuant to the terms thereof) on the Closing Date of

Agreement_ "), including using reasonable best efforts to obtain a payoff
letter in customary form from the agent under the Credit Agreement and, if
applicable, Lien release, documentation. Parent shall provide all funds
required to effect the Existing Credit Facility Termination. In no event shall
the receipt of any such payoff letter or the consummation of the Existing
Credit Facility Termination, or of any other financing termination or the
release of any Lien, be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or
Merger Sub hereunder.

 

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly (and in any
event, within one Business Day) notify the other parties hereto in writing of
any stockholder litigation or other litigation or proceedings brought or
threatened in writing against it and/or its directors or executive officers or

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep the other
parties hereto sufficiently informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to the other
parties hereto and their Representatives such information relating to such

subject to the preservation of privilege and confidential information, give
the other parties hereto the opportunity to participate in (but not control)
its defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or other litigation or
proceeding against it and/or its directors or executive officers or
Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give due consideration
to such other partiesÂ’ advice with respect to such litigation or proceeding.
No party shall cease to defend, consent to the entry of any judgment, settle
or offer to settle or take any other material action with respect to such
litigation or proceeding commenced without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the parties to the Merger, the officers of the Surviving Company shall
be authorized to, in the name and on behalf of the Company, execute and
deliver such deeds, bills of sale, assignment or assurances and take all such
other action as may be necessary in connection therewith.

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by the Company or Parent, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on March 21, 2017 (the " _Original End Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if as of the Original End Date or the First

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the intentional material
breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an order by a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have been issued permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
order shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
be available to a party if such order resulted due to the intentional
material breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(d) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or there is
any inaccuracy in any of its representations or warranties, or shall have
breached or failed to

 



-59-  perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) would result in
a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_
and (ii) is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End
Date and (B) the date that is 30 days following written notice from the

perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ and (ii) is either not curable or is not cured by
the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30 days following

reasonable detail;

(f) at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, by
the Company, in accordance with _Section 5.3(f)_ ;

(g) by Parent, if: (i) the Company Board of Directors shall have effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or (ii) the Company shall have breached
(except for any _de minimis_ breach) any of its obligations under _Section
5.3_ or _Section 5.4_ or the first sentence of _Section 5.5_ ; or

(h) by either the Company or Parent, if the Requisite Company Vote has not
been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement of the Stockholders Meeting taken in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall terminate (except
that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section 5.12(e)_
(final sentence), this _Section 7.2_ , _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ shall
survive any termination), and there shall be no other Liability on the part
of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand,
to the other except as provided in _Section 5.12(e)_ (final sentence) and
_Section 7.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
(a) any party from any Liability for any failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, if required
to pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that the failure of Parent
or Merger Sub to receive the proceeds of the Financing or of any alternative
financing shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub from any such liability or of
their obligations to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger), or (b) any party hereto from Liability for a Willful
Breach of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to
such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at Law or in equity.

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If: (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _7.1(f)_ , (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ or

 



-60-  (iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal
(substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty percent (20%) threshold set
forth in the definition of " _Company Takeover Proposal_ ") (a " _Qualifying
Transaction_ ") shall have been publicly made and not withdrawn, (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ (if the Company is in material breach of its obligations
pursuant to _Section 5.7_ ), _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_ and (C) at
any time on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Qualifying Transaction or completes a Qualifying Transaction;
then in any of such event in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ above, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee in immediately
available funds, in the case of _clause_ _(i)_ , in accordance with _Section
5.3(f)_ , in the case of _clause (ii)_ , within two Business Days after such
termination, and in the case of  _clause _ _(iii)_ , upon the earlier of the
announcement of its entering into a definitive agreement related to,
consummation of any Qualifying Transaction.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section
7.3_ , from and after such termination and payment of the Company Termination
Fee in full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , the
Company shall have no further Liability of any kind for any reason
in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby
other than for any Liability arising from a Willful Breach of this Agreement
as set forth in _Section 7.2_ and this _Section 7.3_. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a
penalty but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee
is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to payment of the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Company
Termination Fee, then the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%
per annum.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 8.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to

that contemplate performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Effective Time.

 



-61- Section 8.2 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including in _Section
5.12(a)_ , and _Section 7.3_ ), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all

action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The partiesÂ’ rights in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, including monetary damages, each of the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by
_Section 7.3_ ). In the event any party seeks any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.5_ , such party shall not be required

 



-62-  to prove damages or obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.5_ and each party waives any objection to the
imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing, providing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In
addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
