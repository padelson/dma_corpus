Company, the full and timely payment of any Parent Termination Fee or Company Expenses payable by Parent pursuant to the terms of Section&nbsp;8.2. This is a guarantee of payment, and
not of collection, and Robert F.X. Sillerman acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full
and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of Parent&#146;s obligations or liabilities (other
than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee.
Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of the Company, (i)&nbsp;any right to require the Company as a
condition of payment by Robert F.X. Sillerman to proceed against Parent or pursue any other
remedies whatsoever, and (ii)&nbsp;to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that
may be derived from or afforded by Law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties. For the avoidance of doubt, Robert F.X. Sillerman may assert, as a defense to any
payment by him, any defense to such payment that Parent or Merger Sub could assert against the
Company under the terms of this Agreement. Robert F.X. Sillerman understands that the Company is
relying on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement.
