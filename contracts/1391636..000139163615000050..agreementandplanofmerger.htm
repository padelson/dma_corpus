NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Article I 
THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company 



shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

SECTION 1.02 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event no later than the second (2nd) Business Day) following
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) (provided that if
such date occurs prior to August 3, 2015, the Closing shall not be required to
take place prior to August 3, 2015), at the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP,
875 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022; unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

SECTION 1.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, upon
the Closing, Parent, Sub and the Company shall file a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the DGCL or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time."

SECTION 1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in applicable provisions of the DGCL and this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time, subject to Section 5.05, to be identical to the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except as to the incorporator and the name of the Surviving
Corporation, which shall be Cyan, Inc. until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law. The form of such amended certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

SECTION 1.06 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Merger and the Second Step Merger, considered together as a single integrated
transaction, are intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The Company, Parent and Sub will each be a
party to the reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. 



SECTION 1.07 Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.08 Officers. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE FUND; 
COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

SECTION 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the
holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Sub:

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Sub Common
Stock").

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock,
or by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
shares of Company Restricted Stock Unit that become vested pursuant to Section
5.13(b) and shares issued or issuable upon the exercise or deemed exercise
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Warrants, but excluding
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), and shares to remain
outstanding in accordance with Section 2.01(e), and, except as provided in
Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive merger consideration having a value at closing of 0.224 ("Aggregate
Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent Common Stock, determined as follows: (i) a
number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the (A) Aggregate Exchange Ratio
multiplied by (B) the Stock Percentage (such product, the "Stock
Consideration"); (ii) an amount of cash, without interest equal to the product
of (A) the Aggregate Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the Cash Percentage
multiplied by (C) the Closing Parent Stock Price (such product, the "Cash
Consideration"); and (iii) any cash paid in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(g) (together with the Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration, subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.01(g), the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease 



to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any declared dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective
Time and that are due to such holder, without interest, in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

(e) Subsidiary-Owned Shares. If any shares of Company Common Stock are owned
directly by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other
than Sub), such shares shall remain outstanding, and no Merger Consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(f) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration and any
payment contemplated by Sections 5.13 shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary
of the Company or of securities convertible into Company Common Stock and any
dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of Parent or of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change or event with respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time. 



(g) Second Step Merger. Immediately following the consummation of the Merger,
the Surviving Corporation will be, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to be, merged with and into Parent (the "Second Step Merger"), and
thereafter the separate existence of the Surviving Corporation will cease.
Furthermore, if counsel are unable to render the tax opinions referred to in
Section 6.02(e) or Section 6.03(d) with respect to the Merger and the Second
Step Merger, considered together as an integrated transaction, as a result of
the Merger and Second Step Merger potentially failing to satisfy the
"continuity of interest" requirements under applicable federal income tax
principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then
the Cash Percentage shall be reduced (and correspondingly the Stock Percentage
shall be increased such that the sum of the Stock Percentage and the Cash
Percentage remains 100%) to the minimum extent necessary in order to enable
the relevant tax opinions to be rendered.

SECTION 2.02 Exchange Fund.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the
Exchange Agent (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay
the aggregate Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (ii) cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c); and (iii) cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments
of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(g). The shares
of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred
to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to, (i) mail to each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock as set forth on the books and records of the Company (other than shares
to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), shares to remain
outstanding in accordance with Section 2.01(e), and, except as provided in
Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares), materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of their shares of Company
Common Stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) issue
to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock the amount equal to the Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c) and this Article II, that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock representing the Stock Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(g) and any dividends or other distributions such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(h), without
interest thereon.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.02(h) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(g) paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to
Section 2.01 



(c). At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than registrations of transfers
to reflect, with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable
state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available) and, in any such case, no
instrument or investment shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely
to Parent. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Exchange Agent to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any former holder of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company Stock Option or
Company Restricted Stock Unit, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable person,
including a holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, or a holder of the
Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit, as the case may be, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

(g) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of shares of 



Company Common Stock, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall
relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have
been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in
lieu thereof cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock formerly held by such
holder that) would otherwise be entitled by (B) Average Parent Stock Price.
The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu
of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.

(h) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock.
Holders of any Company Common Stock or Company Warrants shall be entitled to
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to the date the Merger
Consideration is paid in respect of such Company Common Stock or Company
Warrants in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION 3.01 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except (x) as set
forth in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed with,
or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since
April 4, 2013 (the "Reference Date") by the Company and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (together with any publicly filed
schedules or exhibits thereto, the "Company Filed SEC Documents") (without
giving effect to any amendment to any such Company Filed SEC Documents filed
on or after the date of this Agreement and excluding any disclosures to the
extent such disclosures are general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
statements) or (y) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being
understood that any information set forth in one Section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section
or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each
other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent in light of the context and content of the disclosure
(without reference to the contents of any Contract or document or other
materials referenced in such disclosure) that such information is relevant to
such other Section or subsection), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Sub as follows:

(i) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as presently conducted and is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where any failure to be so qualified or license
would not be, and would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each 



of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted
and each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary except where any failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not be, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") and
the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Bylaws") and the
comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case
as amended to and in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(j) Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as
of the date of this Agreement, (i) each Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) the
type and amount of each outstanding equity security of such Subsidiary, and
the ownership interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the
ownership interest of any other person in each such Subsidiary, and the
jurisdiction of organization thereof. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have,
in all cases, been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights, and are wholly owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens,
charges, mortgages, encumbrances, adverse claims and interests, or security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any restriction on the
right to vote or transfer the same, except for such transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act, the "blue
sky" Laws of the various States of the United States or similar Laws of other
applicable jurisdictions) (collectively, "Liens"), other than Permitted Liens.
Except for its interests in its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
any person.

(k) Capital Structure.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of
business on May 1, 2015 (the "Determination Date"), (A) 48,325,772 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of Company

writing and (B) nothing has occurred and no circumstance exists, whether as a
result of any action, any failure to act or otherwise, that would reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

(vii) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company
Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger (alone or in
conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on

any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of

funding, of any compensation or material benefits or trigger any other

280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(viii) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and the
operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.

(ix) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and
no Company Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any individual with the

409A or Section 4999 of the Code or due to the failure of any payment to be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(x) Section 3.01(l)(x) of the Company Disclosure Letter separately identifies
each Company Benefit Plan which is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States or covers any employees or other service providers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who reside or work outside of the United
States (each, a "Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan"). As of the date hereof, there
is no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened litigation involving
any Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability. Except
as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in any material liability, each Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan (A) has
been maintained and operated in accordance with, and is in compliance with,
its terms, applicable local Law, government taxation and funding requirements,
and with any agreement entered into with a works council, union or labor
organization in all material respect and (B) to the extent required to be
registered or approved by any Governmental Entity, has been registered with,
or approved by, such Governmental Entity and, to the Company's Knowledge,
nothing has occurred that would adversely affect such registration or
approval. To the extent intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, each
Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan is funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions. With respect to any Non-U.S.
Company Benefit Plan maintained in the United Kingdom, (1) the United Kingdom
Pensions Regulator has not issued and, to the Company's Knowledge, does not
intend to issue any restoration order, financial support direction or
contribution notice against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2)

any occupational pension scheme or otherwise become liable to pay any debt, or
has entered into an arrangement which might be construed as a compromise or a

Pensions Act 1995 (or its predecessor, section 144 of the U.K. Pension Schemes
Act 1993), and (3) no acts, omissions or other events have, to the Company's

contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate

outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations for the assessment or

(xii) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the
date of any Financial Statements of the Company furnished to Parent pursuant
to Section 3.01(e), exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of such Financial Statements
(rather than any notes thereto) and do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past
custom and practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns.

potential limitations on, its net operating loss carryforwards and other
similar tax attributes.

(xvii) The Company is not aware of any agreement, plan, fact or circumstance

Registered IP that the Company chose to abandon. Each material item of Company
Registered IP is, to the Knowledge of the Company not invalid or
unenforceable, and is owned solely by the Company or its Subsidiaries free and

activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries infringe, misappropriate, or
otherwise violate any other person's rights in Intellectual Property under any
applicable Law where such infringement could reasonably be expected to result

(A) challenging the validity, enforceability or ownership by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any of the Company Intellectual Property, or (B)

assignments of any such Company Intellectual Property to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

code, design or routine) that causes the Software therein or any portion
thereof to be erased, inoperable or otherwise incapable of being used.

(ix) Section 3.01(n)(ix) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of

from third parties; (ii) Contracts with the Company's employees; and (iii)
Contracts that do not substantially differ from the Company's forms therefor).

Property that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

(xiii) Except as restricted under applicable Trade Control Laws, there is no

Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently conducts business or on the
export or import of any of the Company Products from or to any such
jurisdiction.

(xiv) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has sufficient rights to use
all IT Assets, all of which rights shall survive unchanged following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable measures in an effort to

access, interruption, modification, or corruption. The IT Assets operate and
perform in all material respects in a manner that permits the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business as currently conducted and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no person has gained unauthorized access to any IT
Asset during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof in a
manner that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has implemented commercially reasonable backup and disaster
recovery technology processes and facilities.

(xv) Neither this Agreement, nor the Transactions will result in the grant of
any right or license to any material Company Intellectual Property to any
person pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

(w) Environmental Matters. Except for those matters that would not be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is and has at all times been in compliance with all

Subsidiaries has any liability under, any Environmental Law; (ii) each of the

Materials at or on, any location, including at or on any property currently or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each of the above cases, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
result 



in liability or give rise to a claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under applicable Environmental Laws; and (v) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any consent decrees, orders,
settlements or compliance agreements or has assumed, by contract, operation of
law or otherwise, or provided indemnification against, any liability or
obligation of any other person under or relating to Environmental Laws that
would reasonably be expected to result in liability or give rise to a claim by
such person against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
made available to Parent copies of all environmental reports, assessments and
any material environmental documents in its possession or control relating to
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their current and former properties and
operations.

and casualty, liability, employment practices, directors and officers, and
other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and against

filed on or after the date of this Agreement and excluding any disclosures to
the extent such disclosures are general cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking statements) or (y) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter (it
being understood that any information set forth in one Section or subsection

Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent in light of the context and content of the disclosure

Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Transactions have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of
Parent and Sub, subject, in the case of the Merger only, to the delivery by
Parent of the written consent, as sole stockholder of Sub, referenced in

Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in accordance with
its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and
to general equity principles.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with
the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without 



notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

under, any provision of (A) the Parent Certificate of Incorporation, the
Parent Bylaws or the comparable organizational documents of any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (B) subject to the filings and other matters
referred to in the immediately following sentence, (1) any Contract to which
Parent or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which

filings required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange, and (V) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,

obtained or made has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Parent SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

(i) Parent has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents with the SEC required to be filed by Parent since January 1, 2013
(the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing, or, in
the case of Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, their respective effective
dates, and if amended or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, then
as of the date of such later filing, the Parent SEC Documents complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable thereto, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Parent
SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading. There
are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect
to any of the Parent Filed SEC Documents and, to the Knowledge of Parent, as
of the date of this Agreement, none of the Parent Filed SEC Documents is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. 



(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Documents (the "Parent Financial Statements") when
filed complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10‑Q of the SEC or other applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods and as of the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year‑end adjustments, none of which adjustments has been
or will be material in nature or amount). Except as reflected in the Parent
Financial Statements, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any material off-balance sheet arrangement (as defined in Item 303 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(iii) Since January 1, 2013, subject to any applicable grace periods, Parent
has been and is in compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, in
each case except for any failure to be in compliance that would not be
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(iv) Parent has timely filed or furnished and made available to the Company
all certifications and statements required by Rule 13a‑14 or Rule 15d‑14 under
the Exchange Act. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a‑15(e) and Rule 15d‑15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are
effective to reasonably ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Parent in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Parent's system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is effective in all
material respects to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (B) that material receipts and expenditures are made in
accordance with the authorization of management, and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parent's assets that would materially affect Parent's financial statements.
Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of
this Agreement, to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of Parent (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)
any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
controls over financial reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of Parent, Parent has not received any complaints regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, including any
such complaint regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. To the
Knowledge of Parent, Parent has not identified any currently existing material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting. To the Knowledge 



of Parent, there is no reason to believe that its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when due.

(v) Except (A) as reflected, accrued or reserved against in Parent's

liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
December 31, 2014 or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full
prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities, commitments or obligations, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, whether or not accrued,
matured or unmatured or otherwise, in each case that are of a nature required
by GAAP to be disclosed, reserved or reflected in a consolidated balance sheet
or the notes thereto, in each case except for any liabilities that have not
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied

the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Annual Meeting contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company. The Form S-4 will, with
respect to information regarding Parent, comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.

(f) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From December 31, 2014 to the date

(ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all
material respects only in the ordinary course of business and (iii) neither

of engaging in the Transactions and, prior to the Effective Time, will not

promulgated thereunder), or will prior to the Closing Date beneficially own,
any shares of Company Common Stock, or is a party, or will prior to the
Closing Date become a party, to any Contract, arrangement or understanding
(other than this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of any shares of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor Sub is,
nor at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

customers and clients of Parents and its Subsidiaries). Each of Parent and its

of formation or organization, has had) in effect all Authorizations necessary
for it to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as presently conducted, and all such Authorizations are in full force
and effect, except for such Authorizations the absence of which, or the
failure of which to be in full force and effect, is not and would not
reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not in violation or breach of, or
default under, any Authorization, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no

except where such violation, breach, default, suspension or cancelation would
not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

the Code.

written Takeover Proposal from a third party first made after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial

Directors of the Company under applicable Law, (iii) there has been no

Board Recommendations (B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or
adopt, declare advisable or publicly propose to recommend, approve, adopt or
declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (C) publicly take a neutral position
or no position with respect to a Takeover Proposal at any time beyond ten (10)
Business Days after the first public announcement of such Takeover Proposal by
the Company or by the party that made the Takeover Proposal, (D) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendations within five (5) Business
Days of a written request by Parent to make such public reaffirmation or (E)
make any public statement in connection with the Annual Meeting that is

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event or a
Superior Proposal, subject to compliance in all material respects with this
Section 4.02 with respect to such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to effect such Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable
Law; provided, that no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after
at least three (3) Business Days following Parent's receipt of written notice
(which notice, and the approval thereof, shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change) from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to take such action and the basis therefor,
including all information required to be provided under Section 4.02(c) and
all material information related thereto. After providing such notice and
prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, (I) the Company shall,
during such three (3) Business Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent
and its Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and (II) in
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and any
other information provided by Parent in response to such notice during such
three (3) Business Day period. Any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of any Takeover Proposal will be deemed to be a new Takeover
Proposal for purposes of this Section 4.02(d), including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 4.02(d), except that the three (3)
Business Day period shall be two (2) Business Days for such purposes.

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any "standstill"
or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by 



Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e‑2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with and receiving advice of its outside counsel) that failure to do so would
be reasonably expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosure made
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 4.02(f) (other than any
disclosure made in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change permitted
by Section 4.02(d)) shall be deemed to constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall expressly publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendations in such disclosure. For avoidance
of doubt, it shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change for the
Board of Directors of the Company to make a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

(g) The violation of any of the provisions of this Section 4.02 (i) by any of
the Company's Subsidiaries or any of its or such Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives (other than employees that are not officers or directors of
the Company) or (ii) with the prior Knowledge of the Company, by any of the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' employees that are not officers or
directors of the Company, shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

comments of the SEC), (B) ensure that the Proxy/S-4 complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities
Act, and (C) keep the Proxy/S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete

notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy/S-4 or for additional information and
shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy/S-4 or the Merger. The Company and
Parent will cause the Proxy/S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.

(j) The Company shall, subject to applicable Law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of New York Stock Exchange, as
promptly as practicable, postpone the currently scheduled annual meeting of
Stockholders of the Company so as to constitute the Annual Meeting, and shall
as promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 35 days after the
Proxy/S-4 becomes effective), establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold such Annual Meeting, at which Annual Meeting the
Company shall submit 



both (i) this Agreement to its stockholders for adoption and (ii) the April
Proxy Proposals to its stockholders for adoption and/or approval, including
for the purposes of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the Company
NYSE Stockholder Approval. Other than in the event the Board of Directors of
the Company has made an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section
4.02(d), the Company shall, (x) make the Company Board Recommendations and
include such recommendations in the Proxy Statement and (y) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval
and the Company NYSE Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if (A) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request
from the SEC or its staff, (B) the Company reasonably believes that it will
not receive proxies sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or
the Company NYSE Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum would be
present, (C) the Company reasonably believes it will not have sufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Annual Meeting or
(D) the Board of Directors of the Company determines, after receiving advice
of outside counsel, that failure to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable
Law, including in order to give Stockholders of the Company sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to
Stockholders of the Company or otherwise made available to Stockholders of the
Company by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise
(including in connection with any Adverse Recommendation Change), the Company
may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Annual Meeting as long as the date of the Annual Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 20 calendar days in
connection with any postponement or adjournment in reliance on subsections (B)
and (C) of this sentence. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that
during the five (5) Business Days prior to the date that the Annual Meeting is
then scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company may, and Parent may direct the
Company to, recess or adjourn the Annual Meeting for up to five (5) Business
Days and the Company shall promptly, and, if so elected by Parent, in any
event no later than the next Business Day, recess or adjourn the Annual
Meeting in accordance with Parent's direction.

(k) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Company's stockholders for adoption
at the Annual Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VII prior to the Annual Meeting.

(l) The Company hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to the Voting Agreements,
each of the stockholders of the Company party thereto has irrevocably granted
to and appointed Parent and up to three of Parent's designated Representatives
as such stockholder's proxy to vote all of the Company Common Stock held by
such stockholder at the Annual Meeting, solely on the matters and in the
manner specified in such Voting Agreements. The Company further agrees that it
shall recognize the grant of any such proxy and the exercise thereof by Parent
or one of its designated representatives in accordance with the terms thereof
at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company (including the Annual
Meeting and any adjournment, reconvenement or postponement thereof), subject
to applicable Law. 



SECTION 5.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time and
upon reasonable notice, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (A) provide to Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable
access at reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the
books and records thereof and (B) furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, capital
stock, personnel and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request, and (ii) Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) provide to the Company and the
Company's Representatives reasonable access at reasonable times upon prior
notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof
(so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
Parent) and (B) furnish promptly to the Company such information concerning
the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other
aspects of Parent and its Subsidiaries as the Company or its Representatives
may reasonably request, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) to
the extent reasonably related to the prospective value of Parent Common Stock
or to Parent's ability to consummate the Transactions; provided, however, that
no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; provided, further,
that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required pursuant to this Section
5.02 to disclose any information to the extent that in the reasonable good
faith judgment of such party (x) any applicable Law requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, (y) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to
a third party or (z) disclosure of any such information or document would
violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to terminate
or accelerate the rights under, any material Contract or result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege; provided, further, that with respect to clauses (x)
through (z) of this Section 5.02, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (I) obtain the required consent of
any such third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (II) develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and (III) in the case of
clauses (x) and (z), utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or
implement such other techniques if the parties determine that doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any access to the Company's or
Parent's properties shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations
thereon, shall be subject to the Company's or Parent's (as applicable)
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform any "invasive" environmental testing.

(b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this Section 5.02 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. 



All such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain
entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under
the joint defense doctrine. All information obtained by the parties hereto
pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.03 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to,
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts
to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
taking of all actions necessary to comply with all orders, decrees and
requests imposed by Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions,
(iii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings
under the HSR Act or foreign antitrust or competition Law (collectively,
"Antitrust Laws") applicable to the Transactions and other registrations,
declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, (iv) the
obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably
requested by Parent to be obtained in connection with the Transactions;
provided, however, that in no event shall any of the parties hereto or any of
their respective Affiliates be required to (and in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, without Parent's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) make any payment to such third
parties or concede anything of value in any case prior to the Effective Time
in order to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver from any such third
parties, (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and (vi) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
receipt thereof and after consultation with the other party, respond to any
formal or informal request for additional information or documentary material
received by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions and (B) if any Takeover Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions,
take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. No party
hereto shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under the Antitrust Laws or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Transactions except with the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and
which reasonableness shall be determined in light of each 



party's obligation to use reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates to (and in no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant
of Parent contained in this Agreement be breached or deemed breached as a
result of the failure of Parent to): (i) agree to or otherwise become subject
to any limitations by a Governmental Entity in connection with the application
of Antitrust Laws on (A) the right of Parent effectively to control or operate
its business (including the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time) or assets (including the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), or (B) the right of Parent to exercise
full rights of ownership of its business (including the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time) or assets (including
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time); (ii)
agree or be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all or any portion
of the business, assets or operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates or
the business, assets or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time; or (iii) defend through litigation any claims asserted
under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Entities relating to the consummation
of the Transactions. With respect to any Governmental Entity, neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries shall, without Parent's prior written consent in
Parent's sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or
discuss or commit to alter any of their businesses or commercial practices in
any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parent's
freedom of action with respect to, or Parent's ability to retain any of the
businesses, product or service lines or assets of, the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, or otherwise limits Parent's ability to
receive the full benefits of this Agreement and the Transactions.

(c) The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, to keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals and
consents, including: (i) promptly notify the other party or its outside
counsel of any substantive communication from or with a Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions; (ii) provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications received by any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, from any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand; (iii) provide each other copies and a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any draft submissions, correspondence, and documents to be
provided to any Governmental Entity; and (iv) furnish to the other party or
its outside counsel all information within its possession that is required for
any application or filing to be made by the other party pursuant to applicable
Antitrust Law; provided, however, that materials may be restricted to
distribution among outside counsel only or redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Laws; and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. No party shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion related to the Transactions
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry
under any Antitrust Law unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, 



gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting, telephone call or discussion.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts in order for the Company and Parent, respectively, to obtain the
opinion of outside counsel in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent, respectively, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect
that, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth or
referred to in such opinion, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger and
the Second Step Merger, considered together as a single integrated
transaction, will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

SECTION 5.04 Benefit Plans.

(a) Following the Effective Time and until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, the individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time (the "Company Employees")
and who continue employment during such time period with, at the election of
Parent (i) compensation and benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing or
(ii) compensation and benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.

(b) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Company Employee, (ii) to prohibit Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee, (iii) to prevent the amendment, modification or termination
of any Company Benefit Plan after the Closing (in each case in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan) or (iv) as an amendment or
modification of the terms of any Company Benefit Plan.

(c) With respect to all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date (including any vacation, paid time-off
and severance plans, but excluding any plan frozen to new participants or any
defined benefit pension plan or any plan providing for post-retirement medical
benefits), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, and vesting, each Company Employee's service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor
employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as
service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent such service would have been
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries under analogous Company Benefit
Plans prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the 



Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize,
or use reasonable best efforts to cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

(e) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than
the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with the evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not
later than two (2) Business Day(s) immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(f) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parent's obligations under this Section 5.04
shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law of the
foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such Company
Employee primarily performs his or her duties.

(g) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall comply
with any Law or other legal requirement (whether statutory or pursuant to any
written agreement with, or the constitution of, any works council or other
employee body), to consult with any Company Employees, a relevant trade union,
works council or any other employee representatives in connection with the
Transactions and (ii) the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide any relevant, required information to, and undertake any
required consultation with, representatives of Company Employees in a timely
manner.

(h) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other person (including any Company Employee
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as
a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section
5.04 shall create such rights in any such persons.

SECTION 5.05 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) Until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent
(including as a fiduciary with respect to a Company Benefit Plan) of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective 



predecessors as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the
Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company
or any indemnification agreement between a director, officer, employee or
agent set forth in Section 5.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (including
as a fiduciary with respect to a Company Benefit Plan) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
as in effect on the date hereof) shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such director, officer, employee or agent,
and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and any successors
thereto, to) honor all such rights and fulfill in all respects their
obligations in connection therewith.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") pursuant to any indemnification
agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim"),
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of
any board committee) or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted by the Laws of the State of Delaware, each
such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted by the Laws of the State of Delaware, provided, that the person to
whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. None of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification would
reasonably be expected to be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise
or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an
Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified
Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this Section 5.05(b) shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted
or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim.

(c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect
to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that, without the
prior written 



consent of Parent, the Company may not expend therefor in excess of 300% of
the amount (the "Annual Amount") paid by the Company for coverage for the most
recently completed 12‑month period prior to the date of this Agreement (such
amount, equal to 300% of the annual amount, the "DandO Tail Premium Cap"). In
the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies or such
policies for any reason become unavailable or unenforceable, then, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) Parent may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing
terms, including with respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable to
any Indemnified Party and (ii) in satisfying its obligation under this Section
5.05(c), Parent shall not be obligated to pay for coverage for any 12-month
period aggregate premiums for insurance in excess of the DandO Tail Premium Cap,
it being understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for the Annual Amount.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05. Parent hereby expressly undertakes to assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.05 as the successor to the Surviving Corporation in
the Second Step Merger.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.05 will not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the written
consent of such Indemnified Party. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 5.05(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 5.05
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity). Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.05 is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

SECTION 5.06 Fees and Expenses. 



(a) Except as provided in Section 5.06(b), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are
consummated.

(b) In the event that:

(i) (A) after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Termination of this
Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or a Takeover Proposal was made directly to the stockholders
of the Company generally, or an intention (whether or not conditional) to make
such Takeover Proposal was publicly announced or such Takeover Proposal had
otherwise become publicly known (B) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated
(1) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) but solely to
the extent prior to the termination of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal was
publicly announced or a Takeover Proposal had otherwise become publicly known,
or if a Takeover Proposal has not been publicly announced or otherwise
publicly known or an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have been made for
any reason, (2) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but
only if the Annual Meeting has not been held by the Outside Date and at the
time of such termination the Proxy/S-4 had been declared effective by the SEC
(unless the failure to be declare effective was the result of any breach of
this Agreement by the Company)), or (3) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)
and (C) within twelve months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate a Takeover Proposal or consummates any
Takeover Proposal; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f):



then, in each case, the Company shall pay Parent or its designee(s) an
aggregate fee equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-
day funds (1) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, on the
earlier of date of entry into a definitive agreement or consummation referred
to in clause (i)(C) (reduced as set forth in Section 5.06(c) below by any
Expense Reimbursement paid pursuant to Section 5.06(c) below), (2) in the case
of a payment required by clause (ii) above, within three (3) Business Days of
the date of termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of a payment
required by clause (iii) above, contemporaneous with such termination of this
Agreement, it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For purposes of
Section 5.06(b)(i) only, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 4.02(a), except that all references to 15%
and 85% therein shall be deemed to be references to 50.1% and 49.9%,
respectively.

(a) In the event that clauses (A) and (B) of Section 5.06(b)(i) apply, the
Company shall promptly, and in no event later than two days after being
notified of such by Parent, pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, all of the documented out-of-pocket 



expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent and its Representatives,
incurred by Parent or Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions up to a maximum of $2,000,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement"). In
the event any Company Termination Fee is payable after the time the Company
pays any Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 5.06(c), the amount of
the Company Termination Fee payable by the Company shall be reduced by such
Expense Reimbursement amount actually paid to Parent.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the
Transactions (ii) each of the Company Termination Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transaction, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii) in the event Parent
receives the full Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement, as
applicable, Parent and Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy against
the Company or its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither
Parent nor Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) without these
agreements, Parent and Sub would not have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if a court of competent jurisdiction ultimately determines the
Company failed promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b) or
5.06(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth in Section
5.06(b) or 5.06(c), the Company shall pay to Parent, Parent's costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 5.07 Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. From the date of such announcement
through the Closing Date, and so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company, Parent or Sub shall issue or cause the publication of any public
press release or other public announcement concerning the Transactions without
the prior consultation and consent of the other parties hereto (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any
matters referred to in Section 4.02.

SECTION 5.08 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) pursuant to the 



Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.09 Parent Consent. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of
the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Sub, a written consent
adopting the Agreement.

SECTION 5.10 Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall cause Sub
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply with all of its
respective obligations under this Agreement and Sub shall not engage in any
activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.11 Stock Exchange De-listing. Each of the parties agrees to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary prior to the Effective
Time to cause the Company's securities to be de-listed from the New York Stock
Exchange and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.12 Litigation Cooperation.

(a) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, subject to a customary
joint defense agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(b) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of (i) the timing and
significant topics covered in any material negotiations or discussions in
which it participates with any plaintiff (or any such plaintiff's
representatives, other than discussions solely between outside counsel that do
not contain settlement proposals by the Company) related to the potential
settlement of, or (ii) any settlement proposals in respect of, material
communications received from the plaintiffs in connection with or rulings or
orders by any courts of competent jurisdiction related to, the proceedings set
forth on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Scheduled
Litigation").

SECTION 5.13 Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested
(each, an "Assumed Option"), shall be automatically converted into and become
an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume such
Company Stock Option in accordance with the terms (as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time) of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the
terms of the stock option agreement, employment agreement or other agreement
by which such Company Stock Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to
Company Common Stock under Company Stock Options assumed by Parent shall
thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Company Stock Option 



assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock;
(B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option
shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Exchange Ratio (with such resulting
number, in the event a fractional share results, rounded down to the nearest
whole share); (C) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Aggregate Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) except as provided in the
foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), any restriction on the exercise of any
Company Stock Option assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect
and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule, terms of acceleration and all
other provisions of such Company Stock Option shall remain subject to the same
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and the
applicable stock option agreement, employment agreement or other agreement
evidencing such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Parent or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to each Company
Stock Option assumed by Parent.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that remains
unvested as of the Effective Time (each, an "Assumed Company Restricted Stock
Unit") shall be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with
respect of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Assumed
Company Restricted Stock Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Exchange Ratio (with such resulting number, in
the event a fractional share results, rounded down to the nearest whole
share), and shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable Company Stock Plan and the applicable restricted stock unit
agreement, employment agreement or other agreement evidencing such Company
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
vesting conditions and terms of acceleration. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.13(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is vested as of the Effective Time
and, pursuant to the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement,
employment agreement or other agreement evidencing such Company Restricted
Stock Unit, would otherwise be paid to the holder in shares of Company Common
Stock upon or by reference to a Change in Control (as defined in such
restricted stock unit agreement, employment agreement or other agreement),
shall be paid or deemed paid in shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall thereupon be
entitled to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.01(c) with
respect to each such share of Company Common Stock on the terms and conditions
set forth therein.

(c) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than twenty (20) days after the
date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form
S-8, if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to the Company Stock Options assumed by Parent in
accordance with Section 5.13(a) and the Company Restricted Stock Units
converted in accordance with Section 5.13(b), and Parent shall maintain the 



effectiveness of the registrations statement while any such assumed Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof shall take any actions that are reasonably
necessary (under the Company Stock Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 5.13.

SECTION 5.14 Company Warrants and Convertible Notes.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Merger will constitute a
Fundamental Change, as such term is defined in the Indenture, for purposes of
the Indenture. The Company shall issue timely all notices in accordance with
the Indenture, and take all actions required under the Indenture in connection
with the Transactions prior to the Closing. Parent shall have an opportunity
to review such notices prior to their issuances. In the event the Company
determines that any such notice constitutes a pre-commencement tender offer
communication, the Company shall cause such communication to be filed with the
SEC under a form Schedule TO. As promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare supplemental indentures in respect of
the Merger and the Second Step Merger (the "Supplemental Indentures") as
required by Section 11.01 and Section 14.09 of the Indenture and the Company
shall have an opportunity to review such Supplemental Indentures a reasonable
time prior to the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the guarantors from time to time party to the Indenture shall
execute with the trustee of the Indenture the Supplemental Indentures,
effective as of the Effective Time, and deliver any required certificates,
legal opinions and other documents required by the Indenture to be delivered
in connection with the Supplemental Indentures.

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Merger will constitute a
Fundamental Transaction as defined in the Warrants of the Company issued
December 12, 2014 (the "Issued Warrants") for purposes of the Issued Warrants.
The Company shall issue timely notices to the holders of the Issued Warrants
as to the record date for determining rights to vote with respect to the
Merger, and the Company shall otherwise take all actions required by the
Issued Warrants in connection with the Transactions. Parent shall have an
opportunity to review such notices prior to their issuances. Pursuant to
Section 4(b) of the Issued Warrants, the Issued Warrants will be deemed to
have been automatically exercised pursuant to Section 1(c) thereof prior to
the Effective Time and the parties agree that the shares of Company Common
Stock (if any) issuable as a result of such deemed exercise shall be deemed
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
Section 2.01(c) hereof and the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares pursuant to the Merger shall be registered pursuant
to an effective registration statement pursuant to the Form S-4 as
contemplated by Section 5.04.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may amend any one or more of the
Issued Warrants to delete the first two sentences of Section 1(d)(1) thereof
or otherwise make them inapplicable to any exercise or deemed exercise in
connection with or as a result of the Merger. Parent shall have an opportunity
to review and consent to such proposed amendments prior to their effective
date (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
