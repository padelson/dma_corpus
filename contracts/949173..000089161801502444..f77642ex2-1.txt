iii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 2, 2001,
among MedImmune, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Apple Merger Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"),
and Aviron, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards
of Directors of the Company, Parent and Sub each has, in light of and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that a business
combination between Parent and the Company is fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) accordingly has approved
an exchange offer (the "Offer") as described herein and a merger (the
"Merger") of Sub with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, by resolutions duly adopted, the
respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Sub have approved
and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and  
WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, Parent, Sub and the Company
intend that the Offer and the Merger shall be treated as an integrated
transaction (together, the "Transaction") and shall qualify as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE OFFER   Section 1.1 The Offer.   (a) Provided
that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with the
terms hereof and that none of the events set forth in Section 5 of Annex A
hereto shall have occurred or be existing, Sub shall commence, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "Exchange Act"), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, the Offer to exchange 1.075 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, together with the associated rights to
purchase Series B Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (collectively, the "Parent Shares"), of Parent for each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), of the
Company.   (b) The obligation of Sub to accept for payment and pay
for Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to
the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (any of which may be waived in
whole or in part by Sub in its reasonable discretion, except that Sub shall
not waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex A), the Tax Opinion
Condition or the conditions set forth in paragraphs (2), (3) or (4)
of      Annex A without the prior written consent of the Company) and to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Sub expressly reserves the right
to increase the consideration payable in the Offer and to make any other
changes in the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may be
made without the prior written consent of the Company which (i) changes the
form of consideration or decreases the amount payable per Share tendered
pursuant to the Offer, (ii) reduces the number of Shares that are subject to
the Offer, (iii) increases the Minimum Condition, (iv) imposes conditions to
the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, (v)
except as provided in Section 1.1(c), extends the Offer or (vi) amends any
other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the Shares.
No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be
issued in connection with the exchange of Parent Shares for Shares upon
consummation of the Offer, and in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional Parent Share in the Offer will be
paid an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
Shares validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price for a Parent Share as reported
in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal (or, if not reported
thereby, any other authoritative source) on the date Sub accepts Shares for
exchange in the Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered to Sub pursuant to the Offer.  
(c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub will accept for
exchange and pay for all Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer. The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day
following the commencement of the Offer. Notwithstanding anything herein, Sub
may, without the consent of the Company, (i) and agrees to at the request of
the Company, extend the Offer for successive periods of not in excess of 10
business days if at any expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to
the Offer shall not be satisfied or waived, (ii) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
applicable law and (iii) if less than 90% of the outstanding Shares shall
have been validly tendered pursuant to the Offer as of the scheduled or
extended expiration date and Sub shall have irrevocably waived the conditions
to the Offer set forth in Sections 5(c)-(h) of Annex A, extend the Offer for
an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days beyond the latest
expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under this sentence. In
addition, Sub may elect to provide a subsequent offering period aggregating
no more than 20 business days after the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the
Offer pursuant to Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act to meet the
objective (which is not a condition to the Offer) that there be validly
tendered a number of Shares which constitutes at least 90% of the then
outstanding Shares.   (d) On the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the
"Form S-4") to register the offer and sale of Parent Shares pursuant to the
Offer. The Form S-4 will include a preliminary prospectus containing the
information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall (i)   
2    file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO which will
contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the preliminary prospectus
and form of the related letter of transmittal (together with any supplements
or amendments, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to the holders of Shares. Parent and Sub agree that the Offer
Documents shall comply in all material respects with the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and the Offer Documents, on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
covenant or representation is made by Parent or Sub with respect to
information supplied by the Company or any of its stockholders specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each
party hereto agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Sub agree
to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and the applicable Offer Documents as so corrected to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated to the holders of
Shares. Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel
any comments Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments.   Section 1.2 Company Actions.   (a) The Company hereby approves
of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Company\'s
Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has duly and by
unanimous vote of the directors present (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
are advisable and are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders
of the Company, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger and the acquisition
of Shares pursuant thereto, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder
and approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the matters described in
the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that
such recommendation and approval may be withdrawn, modified or amended if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law.   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, and the documents included therein, together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing
the    3    recommendation described in paragraph (a) and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company. The
Company agrees that the Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect
to information supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule
14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to stockholders of
the Company. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments.   (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and
with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as
of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall
furnish Parent with such additional information, including updated listings
and computer files of holders of Shares, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably
request.   Section 1.3 Directors of the Company.   (a) Effective upon the
acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment
Time"), Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the
Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product (rounded up to
the next whole number) obtained by multiplying the total number of directors
on such Board at that time by the percentage that the number of Shares then
beneficially owned by Parent (including such Shares so accepted) bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company
and its Board of Directors shall, after the acceptance of such Shares by
Parent or any of its affiliates pursuant to the Offer, upon request of
Parent, immediately increase the size of its Board of Directors or secure the
resignations of such number of incumbent directors or remove such number of
incumbent directors, or any combination of the foregoing, as is necessary to
enable Parent\'s designees to be so appointed to the Board of Directors of
the Company and shall cause Parent\'s designees to be so appointed. Effective
upon the acceptance of Shares by Parent or any of its affiliates pursuant to
the Offer, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,    4   also cause
directors designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) of each committee of the Company\'s
Board of Directors as is on the Company\'s Board of Directors after giving
effect to the foregoing changes to the composition of the Company\'s Board of
Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be until the
Effective Time (as defined below) at least two members of the Company\'s
Board of Directors who are directors of the Company prior to consummation of
the Offer (each, a "Continuing Director"), provided that, in such event, if
the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Director shall designate a person to
fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who shall
not be officers or affiliates of the Company, or officers or affiliates of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement.   (b) Subject to
applicable law, the Company shall take all action requested by Parent
necessary to effect any such election or appointment. The Company shall
comply with and immediately take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing
to stockholders, together with the Schedule 14D-9, the information required
by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent\'s
designees to be appointed to the Company\'s Board of Directors. Parent will
supply the Company and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to Parent, its designees and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the
appointment of Parent\'s designees to the Company\'s Board of Directors
pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, (i) any
amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension
or waiver by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, or
(iii) any waiver of any of the Company\'s rights hereunder shall, in any such
case, require the concurrence of a majority of the Continuing Directors then
in office.   ARTICLE II  THE MERGER   Section 2.1 The Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation and shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.  
Section 2.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing
Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day
after satisfaction or waiver of the    5   conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), at the offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP, 1301 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to by the parties hereto.   Section 2.3 Effective Time. Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing
Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger or a certificate of
ownership and merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").   Section 2.4 Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.   (b) The Bylaws of Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   Section 2.5 Directors and Officers.   (a) The directors
of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   (b) The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified.   ARTICLE III  CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF STOCK   Section 3.1
Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or any shares
of capital stock of Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.    6    (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and
Parent-Owned Stock. Each Share that is owned by Parent, Sub or the Company
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
Parent Shares or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   (c) Conversion of Shares. Subject to Section 3.2(e), each
issued and outstanding Share (other than any shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive
a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal
to the Exchange Ratio (together with the amount of cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable pursuant to Section 3.2(e), the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares or
Parent Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, other extraordinary dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.   Section
3.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with American Stock Transfer Company of New York
or another bank or trust company designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"),
for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with
this ARTICLE III, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the
Parent Shares (such Parent Shares, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective
Time and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section
3.1 in exchange for outstanding Shares.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole Parent Shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
ARTICLE III after taking into account all the Shares then held by such
holder    7   under all such Certificates so surrendered, (y) cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.2(e) and (z) any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Shares may be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Parent Shares to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificate representing Parent Shares or cash in lieu of a fractional share
interest shall be delivered to a person who is an "affiliate" (as
contemplated by Section 6.10 hereof) of the Company unless such affiliate has
theretofore executed and delivered to Parent the agreement referred to
in Section 6.10. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(c). No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this
ARTICLE III.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(e) until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE
III. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat, tax or other applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificate representing whole Parent Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent Shares to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Shares and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
Parent Shares.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. All Parent
Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this ARTICLE III (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 3.2(c) or Section 3.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Certificates.   (e) No Fractional Shares. No
certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,    8   no dividend or
distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a Parent Shares multiplied by the closing price for
a Parent Share as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street
Journal (or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the
date prior to the date of the Merger.   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look
only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(c).   (g) No Liability.
None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares or cash from the
Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (h) Investment of
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (i)
Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and
distributions on Parent Shares deliverable in respect thereof, in each case
pursuant to this Agreement.   (j) Withholding. Parent or the Exchange Agent
(and Sub in respect of the Offer) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent (and Sub in
respect of the Offer) are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent (and Sub in respect of the Offer), such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect    9   of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent (and Sub in respect of
the Offer).   (k) No Interest. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
any amounts to be paid pursuant to this ARTICLE III.   (l) Stock Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE III.   Section 3.3 Stock Options.   (a) The Board
of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering
the Company Stock Plans) has taken such actions as may be required to (and no
further actions are needed to) cause each Stock Option, whether vested or
unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exercisable solely for a number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest
whole share) determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such
Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, at a price per Parent Share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price for the
Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option divided by (B) the
aggregate number of Parent Shares deemed purchasable pursuant to such Stock
Option. The Stock Options shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions (including provisions regarding vesting) as in effect at
the Effective Time. As used herein, "Stock Options" shall mean options to
purchase Shares granted under any plan or arrangement providing for the grant
of options to purchase Shares to current or former officers, directors,
employees or consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries, other than the
Company\'s 1996 Non-Employee Director and 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "Company Stock Plans"). The Company has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all such plans or arrangements.   (b) The
adjustments provided herein with respect to any Stock Options that are
"incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be and
are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code.   (c) The Company hereby represents that no Stock
Option, or any other security issued by the Company or any subsidiary or any
agreement to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or is bound, will
entitle any person (other than Parent as provided herein) to acquire any
security of the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary.    10    (d)
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issue a sufficient number of Parent Shares for
delivery upon exercise of Stock Options. No later than five business days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a Registration Statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the Parent
Shares subject to such Stock Options.   (e) The Company shall take all
necessary action to provide that on the day prior to the Effective Time (the
"Termination Date"), (i) any outstanding options to purchase Shares under the
Company\'s 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( the "ESPP") shall terminate
(ii) all amounts allocated to each participant\'s account under the ESPP
shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole Shares at a price
determined under the terms of the ESPP for outstanding offering periods using
the Termination Date as the final purchase date for each such offering
period; and (iii) the ESPP will terminate. At the Effective Time, any Shares
so purchased will be treated as provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement.
The Company shall take all actions necessary so as not to allow any
participant to increase the rate of their contributions to the ESPP between
December 1, 2001 and the Termination Date. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including amending the terms of the
ESPP) necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section
3.3(e).   Section 3.4 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article III to the contrary, if the Merger is effectuated pursuant to
Section 253 of Delaware Law, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has demanded appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to
appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal, such Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands. Any amounts paid to a holder pursuant to a right of
appraisal will be paid by Company.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement,
which disclosure schedule specifies the section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the exception relates (unless it is readily apparent that
such disclosure is applicable to other such section(s)) (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub
as follows:    11    Section 4.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate
Power. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease or operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed individually or in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to
the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of its Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Company Certificate of
Incorporation") and Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), and the comparable organizational
documents of each of its subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date
hereof.   Section 4.2 Subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 to the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 lists

subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens,
and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
of such capital stock or other interests. Other than such subsidiaries,
neither the Company nor any subsidiary owns any equity or similar interest in
any person.   Section 4.3 Capital Structure.   (a) The authorized capital

Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the Rights
issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 8, 1997 (the

stock of the Company are, and all shares which may be issued pursuant to the

terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and not subject to preemptive rights. Section 4.3(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists as of November 28, 2001, each outstanding Stock

Except as referenced in Section 4.3(a): (i) there are no bonds, debentures,

Noncontravention.   (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity principles.   (b)
The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss    13   of a benefit under, or
alter the rights or obligations of any party under, or result in the creation
of any pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest of any

properties or assets of the Company or any subsidiary under, (i) the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement,

likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) No consent, approval, order
or authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any Federal, state, local or foreign government, any court,
administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or
authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission or

connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other

(3) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of

Documents.   (a) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by the
Company since January 1, 1999 (the "SEC Documents"). As of their respective

from any other party to any such material contract, and otherwise has
no knowledge, that such third party intends to terminate, or not renew, any
such material contract, except for such terminations or non-renewals as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, the Company has
made available to Parent true and correct copies of all such contracts.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no other party thereto, is in violation of or in default under (nor

the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such
increases or accelerations as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

demand, requirement or, to the knowledge of the Company, investigation by any
Governmental Entity and no suit, action or proceeding by any person, in each

SEC Documents, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material
respect by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any collective
bargaining agreement or any Benefit Plan (defined below), or any material
change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding
obligations with respect to any Pension Plans (defined below), or any change
in the manner in which contributions to any Pension Plans are made or the
basis on which such contributions are determined. Except as set forth in the

the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or a sponsor or a fiduciary
thereof or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or any of their
rights, properties or assets) is currently bound or (3) with respect to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any obligation to make payments or

for the benefit of any current or former officers, directors or employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries (including any such plans maintained for

subsidiaries required to have    19   been approved by any foreign

the former employee or his or her dependents).   (i) Section 4.12(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists all benefit or compensation plans,

act, made a statement, or failed to make a statement that, at the time such
disclosure was made, could reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the
FDA or any other Governmental Entity to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set
forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar policy.

the date hereof to the Appointment Time, no issues shall have arisen
regarding raw materials, supplies or components which would be reasonably
likely to prevent the launch of frozen FM in the US in 2003.   ARTICLE V

adjustments not material in amount). Except (i) as set forth in the most
recent financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents or (ii) for
liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature

stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Offer Documents will comply in all material respects with the requirements of

supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.   Section 5.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties that individually or in the aggregate, would have
a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any action, demand,
requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity involving, Parent or
any of its subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate would have a
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.8 Compliance with Laws. Each of Parent
and its subsidiaries is in compliance with all Legal Provisions applicable to
its business or operations, except for instances of possible noncompliance
that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries has in effect
all Permits necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business and operations as now conducted, except
for the failure to have such Permits that individually or in the aggregate is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred
no default under, or violation of, any such Permit, except for details under,
or violations of, Permits that individually or in the aggregate are not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No action, demand,
requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action
or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to Parent or any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, is, to the knowledge
of Parent, pending or threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome
of which individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made

good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so

under applicable law, the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal

the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this sentence and the
definition of the term "Superior Proposal") terminate this Agreement and
concurrently with such termination cause the Company to enter into a
definitive Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the
determination of whether a proposal is a Superior Proposal to be made
after consideration of any modification proposed by Parent), but only (x) at
a time that is after the third business day following Parent\'s receipt of
written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is
prepared to accept such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including a copy of any proposed
agreement) and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal (any
revised proposal shall constitute a new proposal and shall require an
additional three business days notice and compliance with the other matters
set forth herein), (y) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have
cooperated in good faith with Parent to    37   revise the terms hereof
such that the proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal and (z) after Parent

will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. The Company will promptly provide Parent with a copy of
any written materials received from any third party with respect to
any Takeover Proposal and of any materials provided to such third party. The
Company shall immediately provide Parent with any such information or
materials if so requested by Parent.   (d) Nothing contained in this
Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would constitute a
violation of the Federal securities laws or result in breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.   Section 6.3 Advice of Changes. The Company
and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of (i)
any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made
by Sub) contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality

warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, by Sub)
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement, (iii) any fact or development which would

any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the
Merger and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
and the holders of Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy

made by Parent, or the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without
providing the other party the opportunity to review and comment thereon.
Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information. The Company will advise Parent, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of

Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.   (b) If the Stockholder Approval is
required by applicable law, the Company will, as soon as reasonably

lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

restrictions on the operation of its or its subsidiaries\' business.

force and effect in accordance with their terms.   (b) For six years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to maintain in effect the
Company\'s current officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person currently covered by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to
Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers;
provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section
6.8(b) Parent shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 150% of the
amount per annum paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year;
and provided further that if Parent is not able to obtain such coverage for
such 150% amount, Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement, and in lieu of the other
provisions of this Section 6.8(b), nothing shall be deemed to prohibit
the    41   Company or Parent from procuring such insurance coverage
prior to the Effective Time, provided that the aggregate cost of such
coverage shall not exceed $2,000,000.   (c) The provisions of this Section
6.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and

indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.   Section 6.9 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company

Parent a letter identifying all persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates"

1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the
Code. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the Transaction to qualify, and shall use its
respective reasonable best efforts not to take any action, fail to take any
action, or cause or permit any action to be taken or to fail to be taken that

Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall

date of the preliminary prospectus included in the Form S-4 and dated as of
the date of the expiration of the Offer, to the effect that the Transaction
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In connection therewith both Parent (together with Sub) and the Company
shall deliver to such counsel representation letters, dated and executed as
of the dates of such opinions, in form and substance satisfactory to such
counsel. In rendering such opinions, counsel shall be entitled to rely upon
assumptions and representations reasonably satisfactory to such counsel,

inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, (a) amend the Rights Agreement or (b) take any action with respect
to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement, including a
redemption of the Rights or any action to facilitate a Takeover Proposal.  
Section 6.15 Employee Benefits. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time (the "Benefits Date"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided,
employee benefits to employees of the Company that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to those made generally available to similarly situated
employees of the Parent. From the Effective Time to the Benefits Date, the

applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any
Parent plans in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time.   Section 6.16 FIRPTA. The Company shall (i) furnish to Parent,
at the expiration of the Offer and immediately prior to the Effective Time,
a certification in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section

property interest because the Company is not and has not been a United States
real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code (in such form as may be reasonably requested by Parent) and (ii)
timely deliver to the Internal Revenue Service the notification required
under Treas. Reg. Section 1.897-2(h)(2).   Section 6.17 Section 16 Matters.

provided, however,  that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

of its obligations under this  Agreement results in the failure of any such
condition  or if the failure of such condition results from facts  or

Offer, the Merger or  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   Section 8.2 Effect of
Termination. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, other than with respect to the
provisions of Section 8.5, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the
Company or their respective officers or directors, provided, however, that
nothing herein shall relieve any party for liability for any willful breach
hereof.   Section 8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by duly authorized action taken, at any time before or

Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall be made which changes the
amount or kind of Merger Consideration or any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the rights
of the holders of any Shares, and, after the Stockholder Approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.   Section 8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the

subject to Section 8.3 and Article I, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.  
Section 8.5 Expenses.   (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section
8.5, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that each of Parent and
the Company shall bear and pay one-half of    46   (i) the costs and

announced, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 8.1(d) [Company breach]
due to a willful and material breach by the Company or any subsidiary and
within six months of termination the Company enters into an acquisition
agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or Takeover Proposal is
consummated, (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
[change of recommendation], or (iv) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) [Superior Proposal], then the Company shall pay to Parent a
fee of $51 million (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Such fee shall be paid prior to termination in the case of

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

Section 8.5(b) when it is required to be paid, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against
the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b), the Company shall
pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in
connection with such suit, including any costs of collection, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the publicly announced prime rate of

conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, be waived by Parent and Sub in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in their reasonable discretion. The
failure by Parent or Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to    54   particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.   Terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement to which this Annex A is a
part.       55    ANNEX B   Form of Affiliate Agreement  
________ __, 200_  MedImmune, Inc. 35 West Watkins Mill Road Gaithersburg,
Maryland 20878  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of the
date of this letter I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Aviron, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"). I have
been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December 2, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among
MedImmune, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), a subsidiary of Parent
("Sub"), and the Company, Sub shall commence an offer to exchange shares of
common stock of Parent ("Parent Shares") for shares of common stock of the
Company ("Shares") and, following the consummation of the offer, Sub shall be
merged with the Company and each remaining Share shall be converted into the
right to receive Parent Shares (the offer and the merger are
sometime referred to as the "Transaction"), all as set forth in the Merger
Agreement, and that as a result of the Transaction, I may receive Parent
Shares in exchange for Shares owned by me. Nothing herein shall constitute an
admission that I am an affiliate of the Company.   I hereby represent,
warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Shares
as a result of the Transaction:   a. I shall not make any sale, transfer or
other disposition of Parent Shares or any interests therein in violation of
the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.   b. I have carefully read
this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other
applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of Parent Shares or any interests therein to the extent I believed necessary
with my counsel or counsel for the Company.   c. I have been advised that
the issuance of Parent Shares to me pursuant to the Transaction will be
registered under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I
have also been advised that, since I may be deemed to have been an affiliate
of the Company and the distribution by me of the Parent Shares has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
Parent Shares issued to me in the Transaction unless (i) such sale, transfer
or other disposition has been registered     56   under the Act, (ii)
such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated under the Act and I have
presented Parent with such evidence of conformity as it may reasonably
request, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent,
such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.   d. I understand that appropriate legends
referencing the Act and this letter may be placed on the certificates
representing the Parent Shares issued to me in the Transaction and that such
legends will be removed when, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, they are
no longer required for purposes of the Act.   e. I understand that Parent
is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of
Parent Shares by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action
necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.   Very truly yours,
