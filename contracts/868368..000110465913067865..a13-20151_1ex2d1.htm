 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of September 3, 2013, by and among (i) Rochester Medical
Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ "), (ii)) C. R. Bard,
Inc., a New Jersey corporation (" _Parent_ "), and (iii) Starnorth Acquisition
Corp., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("
_MergerSub_ "). The Company, MergerSub and Parent are each sometimes referred
to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."
Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Annex I_.

 



 

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the respective boards of directors of Parent (for itself and as
the sole shareholder of MergerSub) and MergerSub have approved this Agreement
and the Merger, upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to the Merger: (i) the Common Stock shall be converted
into the right to receive, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the Merger Consideration; (ii) each Option shall be converted
into the right to receive, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the Option Consideration; (iii) each share of Restricted Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the Restricted Stock Consideration; and (iv) each
Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted into the right to receive, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the RSU Consideration;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of the Company has determined that the
Merger is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
Shareholders and, in furtherance thereof, has unanimously: (i) adopted
resolutions approving and declaring the advisability of the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, resolved to recommend
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Shareholders in accordance
with 302A.613 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (as amended from time
to time, the " _MBCA_ "); and (iii) received a written opinion of the
Financial Advisor as set forth in _Section 2.24(b)_ herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and MergerSub
to enter into this Agreement, holders of approximately 10.9% of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock have entered into voting agreements with the Company,
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting Agreements_ "); and

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and the
mutual promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations,
warranties and covenants herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **MERGER; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; CLOSING**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, in each case, pursuant to the provisions of
the MBCA: (a) MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), and the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall thereupon
cease; and (b) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
and shall continue to exist as a Subsidiary of Parent. The separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the MBCA. From
and after the Effective Time, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 



 

1.2 _Articles of Merger_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the MBCA, Parent, MergerSub and the Company shall
cause the articles of merger attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Articles
of Merger_ ") to be filed in accordance with the MBCA and shall make all other
filings or recordings as required by applicable Law. The Merger shall be
effective at the time and on the date of the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota in accordance with the
MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon the mutual consent of MergerSub,
Parent and the Company, the Articles of Merger may provide for a later date or
time of effectiveness of the Merger (the date and time of the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, or
such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger and as agreed to by
MergerSub and the Company, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.3 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to
read as the articles of incorporation of MergerSub, except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall not be amended.

 



 

1.4 _Bylaws_. From and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of MergerSub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of MergerSub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualify in the manner provided in the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by Law, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

1.6 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof or any Party, each share
of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than
(i) Dissenting Shares and (ii) Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive
$20.00 per share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the
holder thereof, without interest or dividends, less any applicable withholding
Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Treasury Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled, retired
and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _MergerSub Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each share of common stock
of MergerSub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any action on the part of MergerSub, be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held of record by holders who have
not approved the Merger and who have properly exercised dissenters rights in
accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the amounts
provided in this _Section 1.6_, and instead shall be canceled and cease to
have any rights, except that the holders thereof shall be entitled to, and the
Dissenting Shares shall represent only the right to receive, payment of the
fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473
of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
if such a holder fails to properly exercise dissenters rights with respect to
his, her or its shares of Common Stock in accordance with Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA or, after making a demand for dissenters rights,
subsequently delivers an effective written withdrawal of such demand, or fails
to establish his, her or its entitlement to dissenters rights as provided in
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, if so required; or (ii) if a court
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his,
her or its Dissenting Shares or such holder shall otherwise lose his, her or
its dissenters rights, then, in any such case, each share of Common Stock
held of record by such holder or holders shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the amounts provided in this _Section
1.6_ upon surrender of the Certificate representing such share of Common
Stock.

 



 

1.7 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Options_. As of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of any
holder thereof or any Party, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not vested,
become fully vested and exercisable and shall be canceled, in each case, in
accordance with and pursuant to the terms of any of the Company Incentive
Plans and related award agreements under which such Options were granted. In
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of an Option that has a per-
share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, if any, will be
entitled to receive in settlement of such Option, a cash payment from the
Surviving Corporation, subject to any required withholding Tax, equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable
upon the exercise of such Option and (ii) the Merger Consideration less the
applicable exercise price per share of Common Stock of such Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
Person subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any such amount shall be
paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment can be made without

 



      
 

 



 

liability to such Person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. If the
exercise price of any Option is equal to or exceeds the Merger Consideration,
then such Option (whether or not vested) shall, to the extent not exercised
prior to the Effective Time, automatically be extinguished and canceled
without the right to receive any consideration (with no payment being made
hereunder with respect thereto).

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time, without any action on the
part of any holder thereof or any Party, each share of Restricted Stock that
is outstanding, including any Restricted Stock previously issued by the
Company pursuant to the terms of any of the Company Incentive Plans and/or any
applicable restricted stock award or restricted stock purchase agreement,
shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation,
an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock
Consideration_ "), less any applicable withholding Taxes, and when so
converted will be automatically canceled and will cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Without any action on the part of any holder
thereof or any Party, the Performance Period (as defined in the applicable
award agreement) applicable to each Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding,
including any Restricted Stock Unit previously issued by the Company pursuant
to the terms of any of the Company Incentive Plans and/or any applicable
restricted stock unit award, shall end on the Closing Date and each such
Restricted Stock Unit that vests on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms
governing such Restricted Stock Unit shall, as of the Effective Time, be
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration that the holder would have been
entitled to receive had such vested Restricted Stock Unit been settled
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _RSU Consideration_ "), less
any applicable withholding Taxes, and when so converted will be automatically
canceled and will cease to exist. As of the Effective Time, all Restricted
Stock Units that do not vest pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
automatically be extinguished and canceled without the right to receive any
consideration (with no payment being made hereunder with respect thereto).

 



 

(d) _Payment_. Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event more
than one (1) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or Parent shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with the Surviving
Corporation for the benefit of the holders of Options, Restricted Stock and
Restricted Stock Units, cash in an aggregate amount equal to (i) the aggregate
Option Consideration payable to all holders of Options pursuant to _Section
1.7(a)_ (the " _Option Fund_ "), (ii) the aggregate Restricted Stock
Consideration payable to all holders of Restricted Stock pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ (the " _Restricted Stock Fund_ "), and (iii) the aggregate RSU
Consideration payable to all holders of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to
_Section 1.7(c)_ (the " _RSU Fund_ "). The Option Fund, the Restricted Stock
Fund and the RSU Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

1.8 _Payment for Common Stock in the Merger_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association to act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and
transfer agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to facilitate the receipt by the
Companys stockholders of the Merger

 



       
 

 



 

Consideration. Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event more
than one (1) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or Parent shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in trust with the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock, cash in an aggregate
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_ and (ii)
the Merger Consideration (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to instructions provided by Parent, make the payments provided for in
_Section 1.6(a)_ out of the Payment Fund (it being understood that any and
all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent). The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Common Stock (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form) which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
representing the Common Stock (the _"_ _Certificates_ _"_ ) or uncertificated
Common Stock represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares and
receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(c) Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal validly executed and duly completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of
Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, in the case of Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares or Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_), cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, which
amount shall be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the instructions
provided by such holder as set forth in such holders letter of transmittal.
No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable
upon the surrender of any Certificate or transfer of any Uncertificated Share.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of the applicable Common Stock may be made to a Person (other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares
so transferred is registered) if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall
be properly transferred. The Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof or such Person shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.8_, each Certificate or
Uncertificated Share (other than those representing Dissenting Shares or
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_) shall represent,
for all purposes, only the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock

 



      
 

 



 

formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as
applicable and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest or
dividends thereon.

 



 

(d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common
Stock formerly represented thereby. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article I_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be payable
to the former Shareholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
that remains unclaimed by the former Shareholders upon the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand by the Surviving Corporation and any former Shareholders who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look, subject
to _Section 1.8(f)_, to the Surviving Corporation only as general unsecured
creditors thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration, without any
interest or dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of each share of
Common Stock held by such Shareholder. Following the Closing, the Paying Agent
shall retain the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund, on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation, in securities listed or guaranteed by the United
States government or as otherwise directed by the Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Corporation shall receive the interest earned thereon. Nothing
contained in this Agreement and no investment losses resulting from the
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any Shareholder to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, MergerSub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to a holder of Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or any other Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered or any Uncertificated Shares shall not have been transferred
by the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in
cash, stock or property) or other distributions with respect to Common Stock
in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all Legal Proceedings or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any
Legal Proceeding that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

deliverable in respect of the Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article I_.

 



 

1.9 _Holders of Certificates_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates, Option award agreements, Restricted Stock awards or purchase
agreements and Restricted Stock Unit award agreements shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the Common Stock, Options, Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units represented thereby, other than the right to receive
any amounts provided in _Section 1.7_, or, with respect to the holders of
Common Stock, the right to exercise their dissenters rights in accordance
with Section 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA.

 



 

1.10 _Withholding_. The Paying Agent, Parent, MergerSub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments
otherwise payable to any Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement, such
amount as the Paying Agent, Parent, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code,
or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such former Securityholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

1.11 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration per share of Common Stock shall be equitably adjusted.

 



 

1.12 _Closing Date_. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP located at 767 Fifth
Avenue, New York, New York 10153 (or at such other place as the Parties may
designate in writing) as promptly as practicable, but no later than two (2)
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article V_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time) or at such other date as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company
(the date upon which Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ").

2.5_ of the Disclosure Letter. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all entity
power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate all of its properties
and assets, and to carry on its Business as currently conducted, except for

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of (or other equity interests in) of each Subsidiary of the Company have been
duly authorized, validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and are

other than the Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company. No
outstanding securities of a Subsidiary of the Company convertible into or

respect to the obligations of, any Person.

of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, each as applicable to
such SEC Reports and (ii) did not contain as of the time they were filed or
furnished any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

presents, in all material respects, the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of complete
footnote disclosure and to normal and recurring year-end adjustments described
therein, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, has had a material
effect on the Company, is or could reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company). The Company does not have any Indebtedness, except as may be
incurred in compliance with _Section 4.3(o)_.

 



 

(c) The Company is not indebted to any director or officer of the Company
(except for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses or in reimbursement of
ordinary business expenses and directors fees, in each case, in the Ordinary
Course of Business, as described in _Section 2.7(c)_ of the Disclosure
Letter) and no such Person is indebted to the Company and, except as set forth

of the Companys last proxy statement filed with the SEC and the date of this
Agreement, there have been no other transactions of the type required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

 



 

(d) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the
Company required to be disclosed by the Company in the SEC Reports (i) is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and (ii) are

 



      
 

 



 

effective to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Companys ability to properly record, process, summarize
and report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud or suspected
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management, employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting or
others where the fraud could have a material effect on the financial
statements contained in the SEC Reports, or that was received in communication
from employees, former employees, regulators or others.

 



 

(e) The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended September 30, 2012, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent the Companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

 



 

(f) There are no amendments or modifications, which are or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, will be required to be filed with the SEC, but have not yet
been filed, to (i) agreements, documents or other instruments which previously
have been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or
(ii) the SEC Reports. The Company has timely responded to all comment letters
of the staff of the SEC relating to the SEC Reports, and the SEC has not
asserted that any of such responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise
non-responsive. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of all correspondence with the SEC occurring since
January 1, 2010.

 



 

(g) The audit committee of the Company Board has established " _whistleblower_
" procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10A-3, and the
Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of such
procedures. No complaint seeking relief under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act has been filed with the United States Secretary of Labor and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no employee has threatened to file any such
complaint.

 



 

(h) The Company does not have any material liabilities or obligations of any
kind or nature required to be reflected or reserved against in the Companys
consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
liabilities or obligations (i) specifically reflected on and fully reserved
against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2012
(the " _Balance Sheet Date_ "), (ii) that were incurred in the Ordinary Course
of Business since the Balance Sheet Date and are not material to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) incurred as contemplated by
this Agreement.

date hereof (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted the Business
in all material respects

 



      
 

 



 

only in the Ordinary Course of Business; and (b) there has not been any
Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
between the Balance Sheet Date and the date hereof, neither the Company nor

the date of this Agreement, would be prohibited by the terms of _Sections
4.3(a)_ , _4.3(b)_ , _4.3(c)_ , _4.3(e)_ (but only to the extent that the
actions taken in _Section 4.3(e)_ were not taken in the Ordinary Course of

and correct in all material respects; and (ii) all material Taxes (whether or
not reflected on such Tax Returns) due and payable by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully and timely paid. Neither

contained in the SEC Reports other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary
of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. With respect to
any period for which material Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which
material Taxes are not yet due or owing, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has made sufficient accruals for such Taxes in the financial
statements included in the SEC Reports and its books and records in accordance
with GAAP. The Company and its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, have complied in

appropriate Taxing Authority all material amounts required to be so withheld
and paid over under all applicable Laws.

necessary to support any carry-forwards of net operating losses, net capital
losses, Tax credits and other Tax benefits.

 



 

(c) No claim has been made in writing, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
otherwise, by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of

_Section 409A_") has been established, operated and maintained in compliance
with Section 409A.

 



 

(c) Each Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 does so qualify,
and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the
Code are so

 



      
 

 



 

exempt. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Employee
Plans that could reasonably be expected to cause the denial or loss of such
qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material Liability or Tax
under ERISA or the Code.

 



 

(d) None of the Employee Plans is a Title IV Plan. None of the Company, or its
Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates currently has or has in the last
six (6) years contributed to or has been obligated to contribute to, or had
any Liability (contingent or otherwise) in respect of a Title IV Plan.

the Employee Plan or the plan sponsor or administrator, or against any
fiduciary of the Employee Plans with respect to the operation of the Employee
Plan; and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances
exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such actions,
suits, claims, audits, inquiries, proceedings or lawsuits. No event has
occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that would,
by reason of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries affiliation with any of
its ERISA Affiliates, subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other Liability imposed by ERISA, the
Code or other Laws.

 



 

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company
Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, shall, either alone or in connection with any other event(s), (i)
result in any payment becoming due to any Service Provider or satisfy any
prerequisite to, or trigger any obligation to make, any such payment; (ii)
increase any amount of compensation or benefits otherwise payable under any
Employee Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any benefits under any Employee Plan; (iv) limit the
right to merge, amend or terminate any Employee Plan (except any limitations
imposed by applicable Law, if any); or (v) give rise to any " _excess
parachute payment_ ," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, or any

(h) Each Service Provider has been, and is properly classified by the Company
and its Subsidiaries as an employee, independent contractor or consultant
under applicable Law. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has had,
or has, any direct or indirect Liability with respect to any misclassification
of any Service Provider as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee, as a part-time employee rather than a full-time employee, as exempt
rather than non-exempt, or with respect to any employee leased from another
employer. No Service Provider has been improperly excluded from participation
in any Employee Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under each of the
Employee Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in connection
therewith have been made by the due date thereof, and all contributions for
any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are not yet due will
have been paid or accrued on the Balance Sheet.

 



 

(j) With respect to each Employee Plan that is maintained outside of the
United States substantially for employees who are situated outside the United
States (the " _Foreign Plans_ " and each, a " _Foreign Plan_ "): (i) the fair
market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of
the Closing Date, with respect to all current or former participants in such
plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (ii) each Foreign
Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow Parent reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

4.5 _Employee Covenants_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose principal place of employment is
located in the United States and who remains employed immediately after the
Closing (each such employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), subject to his or
her continued employment, with a base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less

 



      
 

 



 

than the base salary or hourly wage rate provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. During the Continuation Period,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
Continuing Employees with retirement and welfare benefits that are
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries including the Surviving Corporation (collectively, " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employees will participate following
the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Parent, for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not benefit accruals) in any Parent
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Employee Plan.

 



 

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for
purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each third-party insurer to (i) waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent
Benefit Plan for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Employee Plan in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Plan ending on
the date such employees participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit
Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent Benefit Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) Parent assents to the fulfillment by the Company of the Companys
obligations under the letter agreements set forth in _Section 4.5 _of the
Disclosure Letter, as amended in accordance with _Section 4.5_ of the
Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(e) This _Section 4.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.5_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person, including Continuing
Employees, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this _Section 4.5_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set
forth in this _Section 4.5_ shall not create any right in any employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



 

4.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall give notice to Parent, and Parent shall give notice to the
Company, as promptly as

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably practicable, upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change,
condition, circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused,
or is reasonably likely to cause, any representation or warranty in this
Agreement made by the Company, Parent or MergerSub, as the case may be, to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect, such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.2(a)_, as applicable, would not be satisfied;
(b) any failure of the Company, Parent or MergerSub to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, in each case such that the conditions set forth in _Section
5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.2(b)_, as applicable, would not be satisfied; or (c)
the institution of or the threat of institution of any Legal Proceeding
against it related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 4.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the Party receiving such notice, or the representations or
warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the Parties hereto and
thereto.

 



 

4.7 _Further Assurances_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Parties shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall furnish to the
other Parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such
other Party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject
to _Section 4.1_, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent,
MergerSub and the Company (a) shall make all filings and give all notices
reasonably required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (b)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all third-party consents
required in connection with the Merger.

 



 

4.8 _Payoff of Company Indebtedness_. In the event that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing, the Company
will deliver to Parent, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, payoff letters (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") from each of the
Company Creditors, which letters shall specify (a) the aggregate amount
required to be paid in order to repay in full the Company Indebtedness related
to such Payoff Letter (including any and all accrued but unpaid interest and
prepayment penalty obligations due upon repayment); (b) payment instructions
on the projected Closing Date, as well as the per diem amount to be added
thereto in the event that the actual Closing Date is a date subsequent to the
projected Closing Date; and (c) wire instructions of the Companys accounts to
make such payoff from the Companys accounts. Each such Payoff Letter shall
include customary undertakings to release in full, upon payment of the amounts
set forth in such Payoff Letters, all Liens securing the Company Indebtedness
related to such Payoff Letter and to promptly prepare and file with the
appropriate Governmental Body such instruments as may be required to effect or
evidence such release or shall include authorization for the Company or
another party designated by the Company to prepare and file any such
instruments.

Company will not, at the Effective Time, be bound by any options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock rights, restricted stock units, phantom
equity awards, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any
Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any equity interest in
the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof. The
Company shall take all actions necessary and sufficient to terminate all of
its Company Incentive Plans, such termination to be effective at the Effective

(a) The Company acknowledges that neither it, nor any of its Company
Representatives, are engaged in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and confirms that it has
complied with, and is in current compliance with, its Standstill Obligations
(as defined in that certain Indication of Interest, dated June 27, 2013,
between Parent and the Company). The Company shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit its Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination

withdraw, modify, or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or MergerSub, its
Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend, or fail to recommend against,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) make any
statement inconsistent with its recommendation that the Shareholders approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger; (iv) fail to include its Board
Recommendation to the Shareholders in the Proxy Statement; or (v) enter into
any Contract (whether or not binding) or agreement in principle with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing listed in (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv), an " _Adverse Recommendation_ " and (v), an " _Adverse Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Sections 4.11(a)_ and _4.11(b)_ , prior to the receipt
of the Required Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through
any Representative, may, but subject to _Sections 4.11(d)_ and _4.11(e)_ :
(i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third-party that has
made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in
writing that did not result from violation of this _Section 4.11_ that the
Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and the Companys financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal;
(ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate,
than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, including the
standstill obligations set forth in Section 8 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that each agreement will permit the sharing of information
by the Company to Parent as contemplated by this Agreement (a copy of such
confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within twenty-four
(24) hours and such standstill obligations will apply despite the entry into
this Agreement) provided to Parent); (iii) following receipt of and on account
of a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation and enter into an
Adverse Acquisition Agreement; (iv) take any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
(which order remains unstayed); and/or (v) upon the occurrence of an
Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation, but in each case referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Nothing contained herein

 



      
 

 



 

shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Shareholders an Adverse
Recommendation with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company
determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (v) of _Section 4.11(c)_ unless the Company complies with the
provisions of this _Section 4.11(d)_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after the receipt
by the Company (or any Company Representative) of any Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third-party
or the determination of an Intervening Event. In such notice, the Company
shall: (i) identify the third-party making any Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
provide a summary of the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request or the material details of any Intervening
Event (including specifying the estimated dollar value or range of estimated
dollar values attributed to such Intervening Event). The Company shall keep
Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including any material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms
thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least one (1) Business Day
prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, that causes the Company Board to adopt an Adverse
Recommendation. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with a list of any
non-public information concerning the Business and the Companys present or
future performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to
any third-party, and, to the extent such information has not been previously
provided to Parent, copies of such information.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 4.11(b)_, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Required Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, if: (i) the Company
promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least four (4) Business Days (the "
_Fiduciary Out Notice Period_ ") before making an Adverse Recommendation, of
its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, which notice (in the case of a Superior Proposal) shall
state expressly that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company
Board intends to make an Adverse Recommendation; (ii) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Company attaches to such notice the most current
version of the proposed agreement with respect to (which version shall be
updated on a prompt basis), and the identity of the third-party making, such
Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, during the Fiduciary Out Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event ceases to exist, as
the case may be, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such
adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the
Fiduciary Out Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, including, any revision in

 



      
 

 



 

price, the Fiduciary Out Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Fiduciary Out Notice
Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and
(iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that (A) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, such Intervening
Event continues to constitute an Intervening Event, and in each case of (A) or
(B), after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the
Fiduciary Out Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including pursuant to clause (e)(iii) of this _Section 4.11_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.11_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including talking and disclosing to its Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii)
complying with its disclosure obligations if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to
disclose would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law. For avoidance of doubt, nothing set forth in this
_Section 4.11_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or other communication pending disclosure of
its position, as contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act.

Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary and sufficient

Corporation will, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring
while such persons are officers and directors to the same extent as is
provided under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing
Date, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will amend, repeal or
modify such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect in any
material respect the rights thereunder of such persons; _provided_ , _however_
, that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from
time to time under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, directors and
officers liability insurance coverage, on terms and amounts no less favorable
than those of such Company liability insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement, for any current or former officers and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any actions or omissions by
such directors or officers occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,

 



       
 

 



 

that if such insurance policies are not available at an annual cost not
greater than two hundred percent (200%) of the last annual premium paid prior
to the date hereof under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ "), then Parent
shall obtain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much comparable
insurance as can reasonably be obtained in Parents good faith judgment at a
cost up to but not exceeding the Insurance Cap. It shall be the right and
responsibility of Parent, and thereby its insurance agent or representative,
to negotiate and execute the terms and conditions of the aforementioned
insurance coverage.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 4.13_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are expressly intended to benefit each of the present and former

representatives) who are entitled to indemnification by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement.

Stock under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and any withdrawal of any such
notice. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, negotiate, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand at any time before the Effective Time, and prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and MergerSub shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the Dissenting Shares.

 



 

4.15 _Termination of Registration_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees to
cooperate with the other Party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions
reasonably necessary to terminate the registration of the Common Stock under

_provided_ that such termination and delisting shall not be effective until or
after the Effective Time.

 



 

4.16 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Legal Proceeding brought by any Shareholder against the
Company and/or its directors. Each of the Parties hereto shall give the others
the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any Shareholder
Legal Proceeding against the Company, Parent or MergerSub, as applicable, and
their respective directors relating to the Merger or the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement. The Company shall not settle any Legal
Proceeding currently pending, or commenced after the date of this Agreement,
against the Company or any of its directors by any Securityholder relating to
this Agreement or the Merger, in each case, without the prior written consent
of Parent.

 



 

4.17 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary and permitted to cause the
Merger or the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including any
dispositions of Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
such Common Stock and including the deemed disposition and cancellation of the
Options in the Merger) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

4.18 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any " _fair price_ ," " _moratorium_ ," "
_control share acquisition_ ," " _business combination_ " or other similar
anti-takeover Laws in the United States is or may become applicable to the
Merger or the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, (a) the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the Merger or the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and (b) the Company Board shall take all actions necessary
to render such statutes inapplicable to the Merger or the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.

 



 

4.19 _SEC Reports_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company shall timely file with the SEC all SEC Reports required to be filed by
it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. As of its filing date, or if
amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each such SEC Report shall fully comply with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be.
As of its filing date or, if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of the last such amendment, each such SEC Report filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each such SEC Report that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed after
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such
registration statement or amendment became effective after the date of this
Agreement, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

(i) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder by any party may be made without the prior written

(j) _Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any term or provision of this Agreement was not performed by any
party in accordance with the terms hereof and that each party shall be
entitled to (after obtaining the appropriate court order pursuant to this
_Section 8(j)_) an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedies to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity, in each case without the requirement of posting any bond or other type
of security. Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objection or legal or
equitable defense to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by another
party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of another party under this Agreement.
