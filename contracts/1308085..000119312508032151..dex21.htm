similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Share Consideration (without interest) upon due surrender of their
Certificates.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Phoenix Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, and are paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable law, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Phoenix Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Stockholders Representative, as the case may be.



 

-14- (f) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to have been in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such
Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Subject to Section 2.9(e), if, at any time after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.9.

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Stockholders Representative or the
Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any successful claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving
Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Share Consideration to which such holder would be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.8.

Section 2.10  _Treatment of Options and Restricted Shares_.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed, upon occurrence of the Effective Time,
each holder (an " _Optionholder_ ") of an outstanding option to acquire
shares of Phoenix Common Stock (each, an " _Option_ "), whether or not then
vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will be entitled to receive in settlement thereof a cash
payment from the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Purchase Price Per Share over the applicable
exercise price per share of Phoenix Common Stock subject to such Option,
_and_ (y) the number of shares of Phoenix Common Stock for which such Option
shall not theretofore have been exercised (any such amounts paid, the "
_Option Settlement Amount_ "), less the Optionholders Escrow Amount. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Purchase Price Per Share_ " shall be an
amount equal to (i) the sum of the Purchase Price and the aggregate exercise
price per share of all Options  _divided by_ (ii) the _sum_ of (x) the number
of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and (y) the number of
Shares underlying Options (the sum of (x) and (y), the " _Share Number_ ").
The Surviving Corporation shall pay the Optionholders, upon cancellation of
all such Options, the cash payments described in this Section 2.10(a) by the
second Business Day after the Closing Date, or such later time as the
Surviving Corporation and the Optionholders may mutually agree. Concurrently
with the payment to the Optionholders of the amount described in the previous
sentence, Surviving Corporation shall deposit the Aggregate Optionholder
Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account, with such amount to be distributed
subject to and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholders
holding a majority of the outstanding Non-Plan Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall have the power to approve all actions under the  



 

-15-  Escrow Agreement on behalf of all Stockholders, and grant the Stockholders
Representative such power to approve all actions under the Escrow
Agreement. All reasonable and actual costs and third party expenses incurred
by the Stockholders Representative in connection therewith shall be withheld
by the Stockholders Representative from the release of the any funds from the
Escrow Account to Stockholders and Optionholders in the proportions set forth
on Schedule IV annexed hereto.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as separately agreed by
Parent and the holder thereof, each award of restricted Phoenix Common Stock
(the " _Restricted Shares_ ") and any accrued stock dividends shall vest in
full, be converted into the right to receive the consideration as provided in
Section 2.8 and be subject to Section 2.9. The Surviving Corporation shall
vest and pay all cash dividends accrued on such Restricted Shares, along with
the consideration payable with respect to Restricted Shares under Section
2.8, to the holders thereof by the second Business Day after the Closing Date.

(c) The parties hereto agree that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
cancellation of the Options and conversion of the Restricted Shares pursuant
to Sections 2.10(a) and (b) above that take place on the Closing Date in
connection with this Agreement, shall occur immediately after the Closing
Date. Consistent with the "next day rule" of Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), such cancellations and conversions shall for all
federal income Tax purposes be treated as occurring at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date. The parties agree not to take any position for
U.S. federal income tax purposes that is inconsistent with this Section
2.10(c) unless required to do so as a result of a final determination under
Section 1313 of the Code or similar provision under applicable Law.

(d) Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.10 to any Optionholder or
holder of Restricted Shares such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state or local Law, and the Surviving
Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to tax
authorities relating to any such payment, deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Surviving Corporation,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Optionholder or holder of Restricted Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation.

(e) The board of directors of Phoenix (or the appropriate committee thereof)
shall take the actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.10.

(f) The provisions of this Section 2.10 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or
independent contractors of any of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries except in their capacity as
Stockholders or Optionholders), other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section
2.10) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.



 

-16- Section 2.11 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a)

(i) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Phoenix
shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of
Working Capital as of the Closing (the " _Working Capital Estimate_ "),
together with a reasonably detailed worksheet setting forth the calculation
of the Working Capital Estimate and an estimate of the amount (if any) by
which the Working Capital Estimate will exceed (or be less than) the Adequate
Working Capital. Parent and Phoenix agree that the statements contemplated by
this Section 2.11 are solely intended to show the Closing Date Working Capital
and thereby determine the difference between the Adequate Working Capital and
Closing Date Working Capital, if any. The Working Capital Estimate and the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
this Section 2.11 and the definitions of Current Assets and Current
Liabilities. If the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Adequate Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of such difference. If the Working Capital Estimate is less than the
Adequate Working Capital as of the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount of such difference.

(ii) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver
to Stockholders Representative the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
showing in reasonable detail Parents calculation of the Closing Date Working
Capital. Stockholders Representative (and its independent accountant) shall
be afforded the opportunity to review the Books and Records, accounts and
calculations used in the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement. If Stockholders Representative does not object in writing to
Parents determination of the Closing Date Working Capital, which objection
must set forth a specific description of the basis of Stockholders
Representatives objection, the adjustment which Stockholders Representative
believes should be made to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement and a
detailed description of the calculation made in determining any such
adjustment (an " _Objection_ "), within 30 calendar days after Parent delivers
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement to Stockholders Representative
(the " _Working Capital Objection Period_ "), then the Closing Date Working
Capital calculation as set forth on the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
delivered by Parent shall be deemed to be final and binding upon the
Stockholders and Parent and the provisions of Section 2.11(c) shall apply;
_provided_ , _that_ if Stockholders Representative validly delivers an
Objection during the Working Capital Objection Period, then Section 2.11(b)
shall apply with respect to such disputed Closing Date Working Capital
calculation.



 

-17- (b) In the event that Stockholders Representative delivers an Objection
within the Working Capital Objection Period, Stockholders Representative and
Parent shall reasonably cooperate to resolve such dispute, but if they are
unable to reach a resolution within 45 calendar days after Stockholders
Representative validly delivers an Objection, Stockholders Representative
and Parent shall submit such dispute to one of the accounting firms set forth
on Schedule V annexed hereto (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. To
the extent permitted by Law and except as would not result in a breach of
attorney-client privilege or similar privilege, or violate any confidentiality
or similar agreement to which Stockholders Representative or Parent are a
party, Stockholders Representative and Parent shall submit to the Accounting
Firm all information requested by the Accounting Firm and shall make any
records relating to or bearing upon such dispute available to the other party
and to the Accounting Firm. Stockholders Representative and Parent shall
further instruct the Accounting Firm to render its decision within 30 calendar
days after the Accounting Firm has received the information so requested and
shall reasonably cooperate with the Accounting Firm and each other to enable
the Accounting Firm to render the decision within such period. The Accounting
Firm shall, after the submission of the evidentiary materials, submit its
written decision on each Objection to Stockholders Representative
and Parent. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
shall be limited to whether the Closing Date Working Capital as set forth on
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with
this Section 2.11 and the definitions of Current Assets and Current
Liabilities and whether there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement. The Accounting Firm shall render a
written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting
computation of the Closing Date Working Capital. In resolving any Objection,
the Accounting Firm (x) shall comply with the provisions of this Section 2.11
and (y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. Any determination by the Accounting Firm with
respect to any Objection shall be final, binding and conclusive on each party
to this Agreement and the Stockholders. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Parent and the Principal
Stockholders. Nothing in this Agreement shall require that any matter other
than disputes under this Section 2.11(b) be resolved by the procedure
described above. The dispute resolution under this Section 2.11(b) shall be in
substitution for and precludes the bringing of any proceeding in any court in
connection with any Objection made by Stockholders Representative and Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.11(b).

(c) Upon the later of acceptance of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement or the resolution of Objections thereto, Stockholders
Representative and the Parent shall determine the amount (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount_ ") by which the Closing Date Working Capital differs
from the Working Capital Estimate. If the Closing Date Working Capital exceeds
the Working Capital Estimate, Parent shall pay to the Stockholders
Representative an amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount no
later than three (3) Business Days after the determination of such Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount. The Stockholders Representative shall immediately
distribute any amount received pursuant to this Section 2.11 to (i) the
Plan Trustee for distribution to all Stockholders who hold Shares through the
ESBOP (in respect of such Shares) and (ii) to all Stockholders who hold Non-
Plan Shares  



 

-18-  (in respect of the Non-Plan Shares) and Optionholders (in respect of the
Shares underlying the Options) on a _pro rata_ basis. All reasonable and
actual costs and third party expenses incurred by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with this Section 2.11 shall be withheld by the
Stockholders Representative from the release of any funds to be distributed
to Stockholders (including in respect of Shares held through the ESBOP) and
Optionholders. If the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Closing Date
Working Capital, Stockholders Representative shall pay to the Parent an
amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount no later than three (3)
Business Days after the determination of such Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount. To the extent funds are available in the Escrow Account, any amount
payable to the Parent under this Section 2.11(c) shall be paid to Parent from
the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Any Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount payment shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. Each party shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, review and resolution of the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement.

Section 2.12  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person ,
including for such purpose the ESBOP but none of the individual participants
therein (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or
consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the
applicable provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to
require appraisal of their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration as described in
Section 2.8, but shall be converted to the right to receive such consideration
as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its
Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Share Consideration for each such Share in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

conditioned upon, and take effect after, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and Phoenix shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Parent, Merger Sub, Phoenix, and Phoenixs Subsidiaries and the Business, as
the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Person and/or any Governmental Entity in

-46-  respective Affiliates to, respond promptly under the circumstances to any

foregoing right, the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each
of Parent and Phoenix shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may

Section 6.5 _Compliance with ISRA_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received for each parcel of Real Property
owned, leased or operated by the Company in the State of New Jersey, any and
all authorizations from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(" _NJDEP_ ") that are required pursuant to ISRA to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To that end, promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall apply to the NJDEP for a
letter of nonapplicability (" _LNA_ ") confirming that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents are not subject to
the requirements of ISRA. In the event that the Company shall not have
obtained an LNA within fourteen (14) days of the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall apply to the NJDEP for a remediation agreement for the 40
Green Pond Road, Rockaway New Jersey leasehold (the "New Jersey Property "),
to permit the consummation of the transaction prior to ISRA compliance
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 13:1K-9 (the " _Remediation Agreement_ "). Such LNA or
Remediation Agreement, as the case may be, shall be referred to herein as
"ISRA Closing Compliance."

(b) In the event the ISRA Closing Compliance shall be the Remediation
Agreement, such Remediation Agreement shall be deemed "disclosed" on Section
9.2(a)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedules as of the execution date of this
Agreement. Therefore, without limitation, Parent Indemnified Parties reserve
the right pursuant to Section 9.4(g) below to "defend" the Remediation
Agreement (which shall be deemed a Third Party Claim of NJDEP  



 

-47-  for these purposes), and any Losses directly or indirectly relating to,
arising out of or resulting from compliance with such Remediation
Agreement (including but not limited to compliance with remedial
investigation requirements and/or remedial action requirements) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain ISRA Compliance shall be indemnified pursuant
to Section 9.2(a) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
_initially_ shall bear the cost up to a maximum of $150,000 to establish a
remediation funding source pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:26C (" _Funding Source_ ")
and to maintain that Funding Source until the completion of remediation.
After NJDEP approves completion of the remediation (and releases the Funding
Source, if applicable, to the Company), Parent Indemnified Parties shall
determine the amount of any Losses directly or indirectly relating to,
arising out of or resulting from establishing and maintaining the Funding
Source, which Losses shall be indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2(a) at that
time. The Company and Stockholders Representative shall each provide
the other with copies of all documents submitted to and received from NJDEP
in connection with the Remediation Agreement. The term "ISRA Compliance" as
used herein shall mean a no further action letter from the NJDEP approving
the Companys negative declaration or the Companys implementation of a
remedial action workplan. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
Losses in connection with this Section 6.5 arising directly or indirectly from
Hazardous Substances released after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that continued migration of Hazardous Substances released prior to the
Closing Date shall not be considered a "release after the Closing Date."

Section 6.6 _Approval by Stockholders and ESBOP Participants_.

(a) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement (and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days following the date of execution of this
Agreement), the Company shall send, to each Stockholder who holds Non-Plan
Shares who has not delivered its consent to this Agreement concurrently with
the execution hereof, a disclosure and information statement (the "
_Information Statement_ ") describing the material terms of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and containing all
information as required under the DGCL; _provided_ _that_ , before sending
the Information Statement Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such Information Statement. The Company
shall include in the Information Statement that the board of directors of the
Company (i) has determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
the Stockholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) recommends the adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to solicit from each Stockholder to whom
an Information Statement has been delivered its consent in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and will take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure such consent.

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement (and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days following the date of execution of this
Agreement), the Company, in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law
and the ESBOP, shall request  



 

-48-  the trustee of ESBOP (the " _Plan Trustee_ ") to (i) send to each
participant in ESBOP and whose shares of Phoenix Common Stock are held, for
the benefit of such participant, by ESBOP (each such participant, " _Plan
Participant_ ") a disclosure and information statement (the " _Participant
Information Statement_ ") describing the material terms of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and containing such
other facts and information as the Trustee may, in its discretion, include in
the Participant Information Statement and (ii) solicit the consent of
the Plan Participants to the Merger. The Company (i) hereby consents to the
use or inclusion by the Plan Trustee in the Participant Information Statement
of any of the information contained in the Information Statement, and (ii)
agrees to promptly provide to the Plan Trustee any information that the Plan
Trustee may request in connection with the preparation of the Participant
Information Statement. If so requested by the Plan Trustee, the Company shall,
within two (2) Business Days of such request, send to each Plan Participant a
copy of the Information Statement (with such additions or amendments as the
Plan Trustee may request) along with any other document that the Plan Trustee
may request in connection with the matters described in this Section 6.6. The
Company hereby agrees to take any and all actions as may be requested by the
Plan Trustee, and to otherwise cooperate fully with the Plan Trustee, with
respect to the matters described in this Section 6.6. The Company hereby
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Plan Trustee to vote
upon the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.7 _Additional Financial Statements_. Phoenix shall prepare and
furnish to Parent as soon as they become available, and in any event
not later than 20 days after the end of each fiscal month, an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and the related unaudited consolidated statement of
income for Phoenix and its Subsidiaries for each full fiscal monthly period
prior to the Closing, and Phoenix will prepare each of the additional
unaudited financial statements on a basis consistent with the Financial
Statements.

Section 6.8 _Confidentiality_. For a period of three years from the Closing
Date, Principal Stockholders shall treat as confidential and shall safeguard
any and all non-public or proprietary information, knowledge and data owned or
held by Phoenix and its Subsidiaries as of Closing or otherwise Related to
the Business by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable
standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure
of such information, knowledge and data as Phoenix or its Affiliates used
with respect thereto prior to the execution of this Agreement. The provisions
of this Section 6.8 shall not apply to any information which (i) is or becomes
publicly known through no fault of the Principal Stockholders, (ii) is
disclosed to the Principal Stockholders on a non-confidential basis by a third
party whom the Principal Stockholders believe after due inquiry is entitled to
disclose it, or (iii) is required to be disclosed by law or legal process

Section 6.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Stockholders  Liability for Taxes_. Subject to Section 9.2(b),
Stockholders who hold Non-Plan Shares and Optionholders shall be jointly and
severally liable for and indemnify the Parent for (x) all Taxes imposed on all
Stockholders and their Affiliates (other than Phoenix and its Subsidiaries)
and (y) all Taxes imposed on Phoenix or any of its

 



 

-49-  Subsidiaries or for which Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries may otherwise
by liable (i) for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and (ii) with respect to
any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such taxable year or period ending
on and including the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of clause (y) above, Stockholders who hold Non-Plan Shares and Optionholders
shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any,
reserved for such Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the Closing Date
Working Capital Statement and taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount.

(b) _Taxes for Short Taxable Year_. For purposes of Section 6.9(a), whenever
it is necessary to determine the Liability for Taxes for a portion of a
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the year or
period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that Phoenix had a taxable year
or period which ended at the close of the Closing Date, except that (i) Taxes
that cannot reasonably be apportioned on a short taxable year basis (such as
property tax assessments) shall be apportioned on a time basis and (ii)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis.

(c) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment under Section 6.9(a) will be
an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

(d) _Tax Returns_. Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to Phoenix or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Business. All Tax Returns, to the extent they relate
to Taxes of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries or the Business, shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practices. Stockholders
of the Company shall pay Parent the Taxes for which such Stockholders are
liable pursuant to this Section 6.9 (without duplicating amounts settled
pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount) but which are payable with
Tax Returns to be filed by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.9(d) within 10
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event less than 20 days prior to their due date, after
Parent has completed the preparation of material Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Business for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (" _Pre-Closing Returns_ ") and Straddle
Periods (" _Straddle Returns_ "), Parent shall deliver copies of such
completed Pre-Closing Returns or Straddle Returns to the Stockholders
Representative for their review. The Stockholders Representative shall
have a period of ten (10) Business Days to review and comment on such Pre-
Closing Returns or Straddle Returns prior to their filing, such comments to be
reasonably accepted by Parent. The Stockholders Representative and Parent
mutually agree to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Pre-
Closing Returns or Straddle Returns. In the event the Parties are unable to
resolve any issue regarding a Pre-Closing Return or a Straddle Return within
ten (10) Business Days after Parent has received such Pre-Closing Return or
Straddle Return, the disputed issue shall be immediately submitted to the
Accounting Firm to resolve in the final binding matter  



 

-50-  prior to the due date for such Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the
Principal Stockholders and Parent.

(e) _Contest Provisions_. Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders
Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or assessments which may
materially affect the Tax Liabilities of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries
for which the Stockholders who hold Non-Plan Shares and Optionholders would be
required to indemnify Parent pursuant to Section 6.9(a), _provided_ _that_
failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Parents right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such Stockholders have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to represent Phoenix or any of
its Subsidiaries interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Stockholders Representative shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for
Taxes which would adversely affect the liability for Taxes attributable to
Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries for any period after the Closing Date to
any extent (including the imposition of income Tax deficiencies, the reduction
of asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or
depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions,
or the reduction of loss or credit carryforwards) without the prior written
consent of Parent. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
not be necessary to the extent that the Stockholders have indemnified Parent
against the effects of any such settlement.

(f) The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to participate at
their expense in the defense of any claim for Taxes for a year or period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the extent such claim
may be the subject of indemnification by the Stockholders pursuant to Section
6.9(a). Neither Parent nor Phoenix nor its Subsidiaries may agree to settle
any tax claim for the portion of the year or period ending on the Closing Date
which may be the subject of indemnification by the Stockholders under Section
6.9(a) without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. The Stockholders shall pay all of the transfer, sales
and use Taxes arising from Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(h) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of the
Stockholders Representative and Parent shall, at each partys sole cost and
expense:

(i) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party
in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party is responsible
for preparing and filing in accordance with this Section 6.9;

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries

requested all information, records, and documents relating exclusively to
Taxes of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries or the Business; or

(iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request.

(i) _Survival of Obligations_. The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall
survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, giving effect to any extensions thereof, it being understood that
in the event notice of any claim for indemnification under this Section 6.9 is
given within the applicable survival period, the provisions that are
applicable to such indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such
claim until such time as such claim is finally resolved.

(j) _Refunds_. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or
offsets of Taxes of Phoenix, or any of its Subsidiaries, for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be for the account of the Stockholders; _provided_ _that_
 any benefit from net operating losses and/or credit carryforwards of the
Company as of the Closing Date, even if generated in Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
shall be for the account of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes shall be for the account of Parent to
the extent such refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes are attributable
(determined on a marginal basis) to the carryback from a taxable year or
period that begins after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ")
of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of Phoenix or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates, including Parent).
The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of
Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be
for the account of Parent. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds,
credits or offsets of Taxes of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries for any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Stockholders and Parent in
accordance to the principles embodied in Section 6.9(b). Each party shall
forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party entitled to
receive the amount or economic benefit of a refund, credit or offset to Tax
the amount of such refund, or the economic benefit of such credit or offset to
Tax, within 10 days after such refund is received or after such credit or
offset is actually allowed or applied against another Tax liability, as the
case may be.

(k) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.9, the Stockholders shall
indemnify the Parent for any Tax for which any such Stockholder is liable
under this Section 6.9 at least five days prior to such Tax becoming due and
owing.

Section 6.10 _Injunctive Relief; Limitation on Scope_. Phoenix acknowledges
that any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of Section 6.8 of this
Agreement will cause irreparable injury to Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates for which an adequate monetary remedy may not exist. Accordingly,
in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, Parent, Merger Sub
and/or such Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to the exercise of
other remedies, to seek and obtain injunctive relief, without necessity of
posting a bond, restraining Phoenix from committing such breach or threatened
breach. The right provided under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Parent or such
Affiliates.



 

-52- Section 6.11 _Public Disclosure_. The parties hereto agree that, promptly
after the entering into of this Agreement, they shall issue a joint press
release announcing the entering into of this Agreement, which press release
shall be in form and substance satisfactory to all the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall consult with each other regarding all communications
with Employees and the customers and suppliers of Phoenix and its Subsidiaries
and the Business and any other Persons having dealings with Phoenix or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Business regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any matters in respect thereof.

Section 6.12 _Notes Tender and Redemption; Termination of Indebtedness_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall commence, in compliance with the terms of the Notes and applicable Law
and SEC rules and regulations, (i) one or more offers (the " _Debt Offer_ ")
to purchase any and all of the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, along with accrued and unpaid
interest and (ii) one or more solicitations as part of the Debt Offer (the "
_Solicitation_ ") of consents to amend the indenture dated February 2, 1999,
as amended and supplemented (the " _Indenture_ "), governing the Notes from
the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes outstanding at the time of the Debt Offer (the consents from the
required holders, the " _Requisite Consents_ ") to eliminate substantially
all of the restrictive covenants and to eliminate or modify certain events of
default and certain other provisions contained in the Indenture as determined
by Parent. To the extent that, as of the expiration date of the Debt Offer
(including any extension(s) thereof), 90% or more (but less than 100%) of the
Notes are tendered in the Debt Offer, the Company, at Parents sole election,
shall either extend the Debt Offer one or more times or promptly call the
Notes for redemption and satisfy and discharge (on a date and at a time agreed
by the Company and Parent), in compliance with the terms of the Notes and
applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations, all of the remaining Notes not
purchased in the Debt Offer at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes, along with accrued and unpaid interest (the "
_Redemption_ ").

(b) In connection with any Debt Offer, Solicitation or Redemption commenced by
the Company, Company shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation, including the offer to purchase, the terms of the consent,
related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the
" _Debt Documents_ "). All mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection
with any Debt Offer, Solicitation or Redemption shall be subject to the prior
review and comment by each of the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate, and each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective representatives to cooperate,
with each other in connection with any Debt Offer, Solicitation and Redemption
(including the preparation of the Debt Documents) and use reasonable best
efforts to cause the settlement of the Debt Offer to occur  



 

-53-  prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time. The Company shall waive
any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall
have been consummated) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing
and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to
the Debt Offer or make any changes to the Debt Offer other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company. The Company need not make any change to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Offer without the prior written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ _that_ such
consent shall not be required for an increase in any consideration payable in
the Debt Offer or for any change that is not material.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Consents. Promptly upon receipt of the Requisite Consents permitting the
contemplated amendment of the Indenture governing the Notes and upon the
request of Parent, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture
reflecting the amendments to the Indenture approved by the Requisite Consents
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Indenture trustee to
promptly enter into such supplemental indenture; _provided_   _that_ the
amendments contained in such supplemental indenture shall become effective
upon signing, but not operative until the acceptance for purchase of tendered
Notes substantially concurrent with the Effective Time. Simultaneously with
the Closing, Parent will wire to the Company a portion of the Gross Purchase
Price in an amount necessary to pay for tendered and redeemed Notes and
consents in accordance with the terms of the Debt Offer, the Solicitation and
the Redemption, and the Company shall use such funds to pay for tendered and
redeemed Notes and consents in accordance with the terms of the Debt Offer,
the Solicitation and the Redemption and pay all related fees and expenses and
the Company shall accept for purchase the Notes. If, at any time prior to the
completion of any Debt Offer, Solicitation or the Redemption, any information
in the Debt Documents should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Documents so
that the Debt Documents shall not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12(c), the Company shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and any other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are
applicable in connection with any Debt Offer and Solicitation. To the extent
that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this Section 6.12(c),
the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations hereunder by such compliance.

(d) In connection with any Debt Offer or Solicitation, the Company may select
one or more dealer managers, solicitation agents or other agents to provide
assistance in connection therewith, subject to Parents consent which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall enter into one or
more dealer manager agreements with such Persons in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent. The Company shall pay (or
cause to be paid) out of the Gross Purchase Price the reasonable fees and
expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent
retained in connection with any Debt Offer and/or Solicitation.



 

-54- (e) In addition to the foregoing, simultaneously with the Closing, the Company
shall, and Principal Stockholders shall cause the Company to, terminate the
Credit Agreement and discharge all other Indebtedness relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries.

of proposals or offers, (ii) direct any other party to solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage submission of proposals or offers, (iii) respond to
any submission, proposal, offer, solicitation or inquiry, (iv) continue or
engage in any negotiations or discussion with any person or party, _in each
case_ , relating, directly or indirectly, to any merger, consolidation,

and services in the Ordinary Course of the Business) of the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries assets or all or any portion of the capital stock, other
equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity
investment or business combination with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (b) otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any person or party to do or seek to
do any of the foregoing. Unless and until this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall
not furnish to any person or party other than Parent or Merger Sub and
their representatives any non-public information with respect to an
acquisition, business combination or purchase of all or a portion of the
capital stock or all or a portion (except for the sale of products and
services in the Ordinary Course of the Business) of assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. If the Company, any officers or directors, the
Stockholders Representative or the Principal Stockholders receive any
proposal regarding a transaction described above, then the Company, any
officers or directors, the Stockholders Representative or the Principal
Stockholders, as applicable, shall promptly notify Parent of the existence,
material terms and status of any such inquiry or proposal.

Section 6.14 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date,
each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, promptly to execute,
acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or instruments of
transfer reasonably requested by the other party hereto and necessary for the

Section 9.4 _Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified
Party hereunder, other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of
Section 6.9) is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought
thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not
be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim), any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and,
to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a "
_Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to timely give a
Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to
the extent that such failure has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses
or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser
number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court
proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it
desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim with
counsel approved by the Indemnified Party (which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _it being understood_ that by
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party shall
conclusively acknowledge its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to all matters in such Third Party Claim, other than to the
extent of any Losses caused by the bad faith act, willful misconduct, gross
negligence or violation of the terms of this Agreement by the Indemnified
Party or with respect to any and all Third Party Claims that are settled by
the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.



 

-63- (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies in writing the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) at the Indemnifying Partys expense;
_provided_ __, _that_ , in the event that the Indemnifying Party under this
Section 9.4 is a Stockholder and to the extent that the Losses for which
indemnification is sought from all Stockholders exceeds $100,000 and the
Escrow Account has been exhausted, at the reasonable request of
the Indemnified Party, the Principal Stockholders shall be obligated to
provide the Indemnified Party with reasonably satisfactory security adequate
(in such Indemnified Partys reasonable discretion) to protect such
Indemnified Party against any Losses for which indemnification is sought.
Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing at such Indemnified Partys expense. The Indemnified Party shall
participate in any such defense at its expense unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the opinion of
its outside counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or reasonably likely differing
interests between them or (ii) as provided in the first sentence of Section
9.4(c). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) restriction on the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law, (iii) a finding or
admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims, that are not
fully indemnified hereunder, made or threatened against the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates or (iv) any monetary liability of the Indemnified
Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Party timely written notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii)
after assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable
steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within 10 days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that
the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; _it_ _being_
_understood_ that the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third
Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a
Third Party Claim,  



 

-64-  including by providing reasonable access to each others relevant business
records and other documents, and employees; _it_ _being_   _understood_ that
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be
Losses.

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other
fully informed concerning the status of such Third Party Claim and any related
proceedings at all stages thereof.

(f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 

(g)

(i) Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 9.4, and consistent with the
terms of Section 6.5 above (ISRA), the Parent Indemnified Parties reserve the
right (but not the obligation) to defend at the reasonable cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party any Third Party Claim, directly or indirectly,
relating to, arising out of or resulting from the matters set forth on Section
9.2(a)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule or a breach of a representation or
warranty under Section 4.21 (Environmental). Parent Indemnified Parties shall
give written notice to Stockholders Representative of any Third Party Claim
for which Parent Indemnified Parties are assuming the defense; _it being
understood_ that neither the Parent Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification nor the scope of any indemnification shall be adversely
affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(ii) Any Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties in the performance
of any investigation or remediation pursuant to this Section 9.4(g) must be
reasonably necessary to defend the Third Party Claim in question. The Parent
Indemnified Parties shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed
concerning the status of any Third Party Claim the defense of which was
assumed pursuant to this Section 9.4(g) and shall provide all information
concerning any such Third Party Claim that Stockholders Representative may
reasonably request, including without limitation information concerning
any investigation or remediation being performed by a Parent Indemnified
Party. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
provide the Stockholders Representative with copies of all documents to be
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such
investigation or remediation not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
submission to the Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the above, Parent
Indemnified Parties may submit documents to a Governmental Entity in
connection with any investigation or remediation _without_ providing
Stockholders Representative with copies five (5) Business Days prior, _if_
Parent Indemnified Parties determine in their reasonable discretion that such
submission is necessary, and _if_ Parent Indemnified Parties exercise
reasonable best efforts to provide a copy of any such submission to
Stockholders Representative prior to submission to such Governmental
Entity. 



 

-65- (iii) Upon request by the Stockholders Representative, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall cause the Company to assign to the Indemnifying
Party any claims or causes of action against any third party to recover any
costs incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with any indemnity for
matters to which this Section 9.4(g) applies, whether or not such matters
have been assumed as provided hereunder.

(h) Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 9.4, the Parent Indemnified
Parties reserve the right (but not the obligation) to defend at the reasonable
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party any Third Party Claim, directly or
indirectly, relating to, arising out of or resulting from (i) the matters set
forth in Section 9.2(a)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule or a breach of a
representation or warranty under Section 4.21 (Environmental), or (ii)
allegations of non-compliance with any Environmental Law in connection with
operation of the Business or the need for any response to Environmental
Conditions at any property owned or leased by Phoenix at or prior to the
Effective Time. A Parent Indemnified Party shall give written notice to
Stockholders Representative of any Third Party Claim for which such Parent
Indemnified Party is assuming the defense; _it being understood_ that neither
the Parent Indemnified Partys right to indemnification nor the scope of any
indemnification shall be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such
Third Party Claim.

Section 9.5 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct
Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days
within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does
not respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed
to have accepted the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or
any part of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be free to seek
enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement (subject to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, as applicable) with respect to such Direct
Claim.

Section 9.6 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of Losses payable
under this ARTICLE IX by the Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by any and
all amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor. The parties agree that the Indemnified Party shall not have any
obligation to pursue the recovery of any amounts under any insurance policy or
from any other Person.

 



 

-66- Section 9.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any
indemnification payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 9.8  _Payments_.

(a) In the event a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this
ARTICLE IX by the Indemnifying Party shall have been finally determined, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this ARTICLE IX,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within five (5) Business Days
following such final determination, unless the Indemnifying Party in good
faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _that_ with respect to any Loss that the Indemnifying
Party disputes, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay any amount of such
Loss that is not in dispute. Any claim and the amount of the related Losses
shall be "finally determined" when the parties to such claim have so
determined by mutual written agreement or, if disputed, when a final and non-
appealable Order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall have been entered
concerning such matters. Except as stated in Section 9.9 below, the rights to
indemnification and reimbursement under this ARTICLE IX shall not be subject
to set-off for any claim by any Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to such
Indemnified Partys claim.

(b) Subject to Section 9.9, if at any time after the execution of this
Agreement the Stockholders are obligated to pay to the Parent Indemnified
Parties any amounts under Article IX or Section 6.9 of this Agreement, Parent
Indemnified Parties shall first exercise their rights under the Escrow
Agreement, if it is then in effect, and thereafter exercise any other remedies
they have only against the Principal Stockholders.

(c) In the event a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under
this ARTICLE IX is brought against Parent by the Stockholders Representative
in respect of all Stockholders and Optionholders as a class, Parent shall pay
any amounts it is obligated to pay in respect of such claims pursuant to this
ARTICLE IX to the Stockholders Representative, who shall immediately
distribute any such amounts received to (i) the Plan Trustee for distribution
to all Stockholders who hold Shares through the ESBOP (in respect of such
Shares) and (ii) to all Stockholders who hold Non-Plan Shares (in respect of
such Non-Plan Shares) and Optionholders (in respect of Shares underlying such
Options) on a _pro rata_ basis. All reasonable and actual costs and third
party expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in connection
therewith shall be withheld by the Stockholders Representative from the
release of any funds to be distributed to Stockholders and Optionholders.

Section 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in Section 6.9, the
indemnification provided in this ARTICLE IX shall be the sole and exclusive
post-Closing remedy available to any party hereto with respect to any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
including pursuant to Section 2.11, and except for claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud or intentional misconduct involving moral
turpitude.

-71- Section 10.17 _Stockholders  Representative_.

(a) Each Stockholder who votes for or consents to the adoption of this
Agreement (each, an " _Approving Stockholder_ ") and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall irrevocably
appoint Louis LaSorsa (and, if Mr. LaSorsa is unable or unwilling for any
reason to continue, Edward Lieberman) as the Stockholders Representative on
his or her behalf, with the same effect as if each of such Approving
Stockholder had individually appointed such Stockholders Representative, with
full power and authority to act in the name of and for and on behalf of
each Approving Stockholder with respect to all matters arising in connection
with, or related to, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of the matters referred to
in this Section 10.17 shall be deemed to have been accepted, agreed upon,
acknowledged or consented to, as applicable, by each Approving Stockholder
upon the vote or consent by such Approving Stockholder for the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. The Stockholders Representative has been appointed (i)
the agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Approving Stockholder,
with full power of substitution, and with full capacity and authority in its
sole discretion, to act in the name of and for and on behalf of each Approving
Stockholder in connection with all matters arising out of, resulting from,
contemplated by or related or incident to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and (ii) the agent for service of process for each Approving
Stockholder, and the Approving Stockholders have irrevocably consented to the
service of any and all process in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement by the delivery of such process to the
Stockholders Representative. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the power of the Stockholders Representative shall include the
power to represent each Approving Stockholder with respect to all aspects of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which power shall include, without
limitation, the power to (i) receive any payment or transfer to be made
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) waive any and all
conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (iii) amend this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and any agreement executed in connection
herewith or therewith in any respect, (iv) bring, assert, defend, negotiate
or settle any claims or actions for indemnity pursuant to ARTICLE IX hereof,
(v) retain legal counsel and be reimbursed by the Approving Stockholders for
all fees, expenses and other charges of such legal counsel, (vi)
receive notices or other communications, (vii) deliver any notices,
certificates or other documents required, and (viii) take all such other
action and to do all such other things as the Stockholders Representative
deems necessary or advisable with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Parent and Merger Sub shall have the absolute right and
authority to rely upon the acts taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Approving Stockholders, and the
Parent shall have no duty to inquire as to the acts and omissions of the
Stockholders Representative. Each Approving Stockholder has acknowledged and
agreed that (i) all deliveries by the Parent, including, without limitation,
any payment, to the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed deliveries to
the Stockholders, (ii) the Parent shall not have any liability with respect to
any aspect of the distribution or communication of such deliveries between
the Stockholders Representative and any Stockholder and (iii) any disclosure
made to the Stockholders Representative by or on behalf of the Parent shall
be deemed to be a disclosure made to each Stockholder. Each Approving
Stockholder has agreed that any payment made by or on behalf of the Parent to
the Stockholders Representative on any Stockholders behalf (including,
without limitation,  



 

-72-  payments under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement) shall be deemed a
direct payment to such Stockholder, and such Stockholder shall have no
recourse to the Parent in the event that such payment is not delivered to
such Stockholder by the Stockholders Representative for any reason. In the
event each of Mr. LaSorsa and Mr. Lieberman refuses to, or is no longer
capable of, serving as the Stockholders Representative hereunder, the
Approving Stockholders shall promptly appoint a successor Stockholders
Representative who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent and shall
thereafter be a successor Stockholders Representative hereunder, and the
Stockholders Representative shall serve until such successor is duly
appointed and qualified to act hereunder.

(b) The Approving Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholders Representative from and against any and all loss, liability,
cost, damage and expense, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel
fees and third party expenses which the Stockholders Representative may
suffer or incur by reason of any action, claim or proceeding brought against
the Stockholders Representative arising out of or relating in any way to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which this
Agreement relates, unless such losses, liabilities, costs damages and expenses
shall have been finally adjudicated to have resulted from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Stockholders Representative.
