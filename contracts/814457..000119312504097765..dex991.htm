and in the best interest of, the Companys stockholders, and has unanimously
approved this Agreement and resolved to recommend that the Board of Directors
of the Company (together with the Special Committee, the " _Company Board_ ")
approve this Agreement and recommend that the Companys stockholders approve
and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger;



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the terms
of the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Companys stockholders, and has approved this Agreement and
resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders approve and adopt this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Acquirer shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquirer shall cease, and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Acquirer in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger and the other transactions
contemplated herein are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the
"Transactions." Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Vedder, Price, Kaufman and Kammholz, P.C., 222
North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, Illinois 60601 at 9:00 a.m.,
Chicago time, on the business day following the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by Law (as defined in Section 3.05(a)), waiver by the
applicable party or parties of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other
than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time
of the Closing but subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted
by Law, waiver by the applicable party or parties) of such conditions), or at
such other time and date as the Acquirer and Company shall agree in writing.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Closing Date_."



Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the
Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger in form reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such other time as Acquirer and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").



Section 1.04  _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects on the Company and
Acquirer as set forth in the DGCL, including in Section 259 thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Acquirer shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Acquirer shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. Acquirer shall file
a restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Restated Acquirer Certificate_ "), which shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended (subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in
Section 6.05 of this Agreement) as provided therein and by applicable Law.
Acquirer shall amend and restate its by-laws as of the Effective Time (the "
_Restated Acquirer By-laws_ "), which shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended (subject to the restrictions and
limitations contained in Section 6.05 of this Agreement) as provided therein
and by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall have the
reasonable right to review and comment upon the Restated Acquirer Certificate
and Restated Acquirer By-laws prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
provisions relating to Section 6.05.



Section 1.06 _Directors_. The directors of Acquirer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 



 

2 Section 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of Acquirer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.



ARTICLE II



EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Acquirer:



(a) _Capital Stock of Acquirer_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Acquirer shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock; Acquirer-Owned Stock_. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is (i) held in the treasury of
the Company, or (ii) owned by the Acquirer shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. (i) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.01(d), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (together with any Company Rights, if still
outstanding) shall be converted into the right to receive, in exchange for
such share of Company Common Stock, an amount of cash, without interest, equal
to $1.50 (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ").



(ii) The cash payable upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to collectively as the " _Merger
Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02, without interest.



(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person, other
than any member of the Acquirer Group, who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") and who, as of the Effective
Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn or otherwise forfeited appraisal
rights (collectively, the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to



 

3 payment in accordance with Section 262; provided, however, that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
in accordance with Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c). At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Acquirer of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, together with copies of any
correspondence or filings related thereto, and Acquirer shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Acquirer, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such appraisal demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.



(e) _Stock Options_. Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock issued under any Company Stock Plan
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ "), whether vested or unvested,
as to which an option cancellation agreement (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Company and Acquirer) has been delivered prior to the
Effective Time, shall terminate and be canceled as of the Effective Time. In
consideration for the cancellation thereof, each person, other than any
member of the Acquirer Group, who holds an exercisable Company Stock Option
(including options which, by their terms, become exercisable as a result of
the Transactions hereby) shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
therefor, a cash payment on or promptly after the Closing Date (the
"Cancellation Consideration") equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option.



(f) _Certain Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time or earlier termination of this
Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration applicable to such shares of Company Common Stock shall
be appropriately adjusted.



Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of Certificates. At the Effective Time, Acquirer shall directly
provide to the Paying Agent all the cash necessary to pay for the shares
of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and the amount of Cancellation
Consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section
2.01(e) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



 

4 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Paying
Agent receives an electronic copy of the Companys stock records as of the
Effective Time, suitable for the Paying Agents use, from the Companys
transfer agent), Acquirer shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), a letter of
transmittal reasonably acceptable to Acquirer and the Company, and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall deliver in accordance with the
letter of transmittal as promptly as practicable, the amount of cash into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes (as defined in Section 9.03) required by reason of the payment to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Acquirer that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b)(i), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest,
into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



(ii) Upon the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the Paying Agent an
electronic listing, suitable for the Paying Agents use, of each holder of
Company Stock Options who has not previously exercised his or her Company
Stock Options and who has executed and delivered an option cancellation
agreement. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Acquirer shall instruct the
Paying Agent to deliver the Cancellation Consideration due each such holder
in accordance with Section 2.01(e) as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter.
Following the Effective Time, upon the execution and delivery of an option
cancellation agreement by any holder of Company Stock Options, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide the Paying Agent with an electronic listing suitable
for the Paying Agents use with respect to such holder, and shall instruct
the Paying Agent to deliver the Cancellation Consideration due such holder in
accordance with Section 2.01(e) as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than five Business Days after the Paying Agent receives such listing.
Payment of the Cancellation Consideration shall be net of any required
withholding taxes, and no interest shall be paid or accrue thereon.



 

5 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock
and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options for 9 months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Surviving Corporation and any holder of
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Stock Options who has not by then complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment on such holders
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Stock Options of Merger Consideration or Cancellation Consideration.



(e) _No Liability_. None of Acquirer, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common
Stock has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
3.05(b)), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Acquirer, on a daily
basis. Pending payment of such funds to the holders of Certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock or the holders of Company Stock
Options, such funds will be held and shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
Acquirer directs (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of the
holders of Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Stock Options) in the direct obligations of the United States,
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest or commercial
paper rated of the highest quality by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors. The Exchange Fund shall not be used except as provided in
this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any losses resulting from such
investments shall be the sole responsibility of Acquirer and shall not in any
way limit the obligations of Acquirer to holders of Certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options.



(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Acquirer, the



 

6 posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article II.



(h) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity
and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.



(i)  _Termination of Agreement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent
to promptly return any Certificates theretofore submitted or delivered to the
Paying Agent, without charge to the person who submitted such Certificates.

Section 3.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver

Transactions, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to

Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and
to general equity principles.

Board are sufficient to render inapplicable the provisions of Section 203 of
the DGCL to (A) this Agreement, (B) the Merger and (C) the other
Transactions. No other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other Transaction.

organizational document) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice

rights of termination or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien
(other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under any provision of any contract (whether
written or oral), lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit,
concession, franchise or other instrument (other than a Company Benefit Plan)
or permit to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound, except in the
case of clauses (i) and (iii) for violations, breaches or defaults which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization (" _Consent_
") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from, any
domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial, local or
otherwise) government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be
obtained or made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with
the execution, delivery



 

10 and performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation of the
Transactions, the failure of which to submit or obtain would, individually or
in the aggregate, have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, other
than (i) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") of (A) a proxy statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "

amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule 13E-3_ ") and (C)

filings as may be required under the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock
Market, Inc., (v) requirements, if any, under Competition Laws, (vi)
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any
foreign country or (vii) such other items required solely by reason of the
participation of Acquirer or its stockholders or affiliates in the
Transactions. 



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board shall have
taken such action necessary to (i) render the Company Rights inapplicable to
(A) this Agreement, (B) the Merger and (C) the other Transactions, and (ii)
ensure that (A) neither of Acquirer nor any of its stockholders, affiliates
or associates is or will become an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) by reason of this Agreement, the Merger or any other
Transaction and (B) a "Distribution Date" (as defined in the Company
Rights Agreement) shall not occur by reason of this Agreement, the Merger or
any other Transaction.



Section 3.06 _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. (a) The Company has
filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required

in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

Financial Statements_ ") of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents
comply in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_
") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments).



 

11 (c) Other than as disclosed in the Company Financial Statements (including the
notes thereto), as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than (i) liabilities or
obligations incurred since March 27, 2004 in the ordinary course of business,
(ii) liabilities and obligations relating to, or incurred in connection with,
the Transactions, and (iii) liabilities and obligations which, individually or

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein about Acquirer, any other member of the
Acquirer Group or their Representatives, or based on information supplied by

Acquirer, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Acquirer, the recommendation by the Company Board of this Agreement or the

any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar

Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Acquirer informed of the status
(including any change to the material terms) of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry.

Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Special
Committee, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law, it being
understood that if any such disclosure constitutes an Adverse Recommendation
Change, Acquirer shall have the rights provided in the event of an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement

to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company determines in good faith
that such delay is required by applicable law or to comply with written or
verbal comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Such 30
day period shall constitute the 30 day written notice period for purposes of
Section 8.01(c)(i).



Section 6.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, unless, to the extent
permitted by Section 5.02(b), the Company Board approves or recommends a
Superior Company Proposal, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,

any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall (i)
take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or
this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger and the other Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the



 

18 Company and its Representatives shall not be prohibited under this Section
6.02 from taking any action permitted by Sections 5.02(b) or (d). Acquirer

not parties to this Agreement, and each of the Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein. The parties hereto agree

its affiliates).



(c) In the event the Agreement is terminated by Acquirer pursuant to Section
8.01(c), the Company shall promptly pay to Acquirer the Acquirer Expenses,

in this Agreement to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be
to a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein", "hereby" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or
instrument as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a result of any
applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this

economic or legal substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible. 



Section 9.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and

need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement, and each other agreement
or instrument entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated
hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the



 

31 extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, shall be treated
in all manner and respects and for all purposes as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each
other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine to deliver a signature
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of this Agreement or any such agreement or
instrument, and each such party forever waives any such defense.



Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the

remedies.

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless

conflicts of laws thereof.



Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.



Section 9.10 _Enforcement; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any Illinois state court or any Federal court located in
Chicago, Illinois, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Illinois state court or any Federal court located in Chicago, Illinois for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceedings arising out of this
Agreement or any Transaction (and each party agrees that no such suit, action
or proceeding arising out of to this Agreement or any Transaction shall be
brought by it or any of its affiliates except in such courts). Each party
hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such partys respective address set forth above shall be effective service
of process for any suit, action or proceeding in Illinois with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 9.10. Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not
to plead or claim) any objection to



 

32 the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any Transaction in any Illinois State court or any Federal court
located in Chicago, Illinois, or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.



(b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
suit, action or proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or any Transaction. Each party hereto, (i)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the
event of any suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.10(b).
