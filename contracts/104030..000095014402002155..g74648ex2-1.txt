than those of the Foreign Significant Subsidiaries, a complete and correct
copy of each of the following documents (if applicable) has been provided or
made available to Buyer: (i) all current plan and related trust documents,

Foreign Significant Subsidiaries, a complete and correct copy of all current
plan and related trust documents, and all amendments thereto, all summaries
or other summary descriptions, and the most recent actuarial and/or valuation
reports have been provided or made available to Buyer. No employees of the
Foreign Significant Subsidiaries have any material benefits that are in

Company Employee Plan and other than any failures which would not be
reasonably likely to have individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company has complied in all material
respects with the terms of each plan and applicable law, (ii) the Company and
the Significant Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to have been performed by them under such plan,
(iii) the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries are not materially in
violation of such plan, and (iv) no event has occurred and, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection
with which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is reasonably
likely to be subject to any liability under the term of such Company Employee
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of the Significant Subsidiaries has
any actual or contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than the
payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, including
without limitation, any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any Company Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
(ii) the withdrawal from any multiemployer plan, and no fact or event exists
which is reasonably likely to give rise to any such liability.   (d) The
Company Employee Plans and their related trusts intended to qualify under
Sections 401 and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, are so qualified and have
been determined by the IRS to qualify under such Sections. To the extent that
any Company Employee Plans have not been determined by the IRS to qualify
under Sections 401 and 501(a) of the Code or amended to comply with the
applicable law, the remedial amendment period permitting
retroactive amendment of these Company Employee Plans has not expired. To the
Company\'s Knowledge (i) nothing has occurred since the date of any such
determination that could reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds to
revoke such determination, and (ii) the IRS has not taken any action to
revoke any such letter.   (e) All contributions and payments required to
have been made under or with respect to any Company Employee Plan or under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law to any trusts established
thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due date therefor
or accrued on the Company     25   Balance Sheet (including any valid
extensions) and no material fees are due which have not been paid or accrued
on the Company Balance Sheet.   (f) All (i) insurance premiums required to
be paid with respect to, (ii) benefits, expenses, and other amounts due and
payable under, and (iii) contributions, transfers, or payments required to be
made to, any Company Employee Plan prior to the Closing Date will have been
paid, made or accrued on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any
insurance policy providing funding for benefits under any Company Employee
Plan, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there is no liability of the Company or
any of Company\'s Affiliates, in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment,
loss sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor would
there be any such liability if such insurance policy was terminated on the
date hereof. With respect to any insurance policy that has, or does, provide
funding for benefits under any Company Employee Plan, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership,
conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent.  
(g) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.13, there are no pending or, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, threatened actions, claims, proceedings
or investigations against any Company Employee Plan or its assets, plan
sponsor, plan administrator, or fiduciaries or trustees with respect to the
operation of such plan (other than benefit claims in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice which, if adversely determined, would not have,
and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect), nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, is
there any basis for one.   (h) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.13, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with an
individual\'s termination of employment) will or could (i) result in any
payment (including without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation,
or otherwise) becoming due to any director, officer or employee (current,
former or retired) of the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Employee Plan
or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits.   (i) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.13, none of the
Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree
welfare benefits to any person, except as required by Law and no Company
Employee Plan provides benefits to any individual who is not a current or
former employee or director of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, or
the dependents or other beneficiaries of any such current or former
employee.   (j) Except as otherwise disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.13, the Company
or the Company\'s Significant Subsidiaries have reserved all rights necessary
to amend or terminate each of the Company Employee Plans without the consent
of any other person. Neither the Company nor any of Company\'s Significant
Subsidiaries has agreed or committed to institute any material plan, program,
arrangement or agreement for the benefit of employees or former employees of
the Company other than the Company Employee Plans, or to make any    
26   amendments to any of the Company Employee Plans, except as required by
law, or to continue the Company Employee Plans for a given period of time and
no plans have been announced to establish any such new arrangements.   (k)
Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.13, assuming that the Merger will not
occur, the Company reasonably expects that the disallowance of a deduction
under Section 162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration will not apply to
any amount paid or payable by the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary during the current taxable year of the Company under any contract,
Company Employee Plan, program, arrangement or understanding currently in
effect.   3.14 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company and each of the
Significant Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with, and are not in
violation of, and have not received any written notice alleging any violation
with respect to, any provisions of any Laws applicable to the conduct of its
business (including, without limitation, immigration Laws), or the ownership
or operation of its properties or assets, except for such failures to comply,
violations and notices as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   3.15 LICENSES, PERMITS AND
AUTHORIZATIONS. SCHEDULE 3.15 lists all of the Company\'s and the Significant
Subsidiaries\' material permits, licenses, authorizations (including FCC
Authorizations defined herein) and franchises from Governmental Entities (the

Permits and, except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.15, no Company Permit shall
cease to be effective as a result of the Merger and, except where the failure
to have, or of such non-compliance or failure to be effective, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

than with respect to workers compensation claims and other claims arising in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), except with
respect to (i) above, such non-compliance or engagement , or (ii) above, such
proceedings, as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   3.17
INSURANCE. The Company and each of the Significant Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies (the "INSURANCE POLICIES") with reputable
insurance carriers (including Titania Insurance Company of America) against
all risks of a character and in such amounts as, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
are usually insured against by similarly situated companies in the same or
similar businesses including, without limitation, insurance adequate to
comply with the terms of all Customer Contracts. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 3.17(I), each Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and is
valid, outstanding and enforceable, and all premiums due thereon have been
paid in full, and except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.17(II), none of the

materially adverse manner) by reason of the Merger, and the Company and each
of the Significant Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with
the provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the insured party,

Policy has provided the Company or any Significant Subsidiary with written
notice of cancellation or a written notice generally disclaiming liability
under any such policy or indicated in writing any intent to do so or not to
renew any such policy, except to the extent the failure to be in full force
and effect or enforceable, or failure to pay premiums, termination, lapse,
failure to comply, notice of cancellation or notice disclaiming liability or
notice of non-renewal would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   3.18 TANGIBLE ASSETS. The Company
directly or through one of the Significant Subsidiaries owns or leases all
tangible assets material to the conduct of the Company\'s and the Significant
Subsidiaries\' business as presently conducted (the "TANGIBLE ASSETS"). All
of the Tangible Assets that are owned, are owned free and clear of all Liens
except for (a) Liens disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement (b) Permitted Liens and (c) other Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the

reasonably likely to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in SCHEDULE 3.18, the Tangible Assets are free from material
defects, have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice,
are in good operating condition and adequate repair (subject to normal wear
and tear) and are suitable for the purpose for which they are presently used,
except for any existing defects or needed repairs which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries has been suspended or debarred from bidding on contracts or
subcontracts with any Governmental Entity ("GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS"); no such
suspension or debarment has been initiated or, to the Company\'s Knowledge,

referred to in this sentence, pursuant to normal and customary audits and
reviews associated with such Government Contracts and with the business of
the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries relating to the procurement of
Government Contracts, generally. To the Company\'s Knowledge, there is no
valid basis for (a) the suspension or debarment of the Company or any of the
Significant Subsidiaries from bidding on any Government Contracts, or (b) any
material claim pursuant to an audit or investigation by any of the entities
named in the foregoing sentence; that, in each case, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set

Subsidiaries has any material agreements, contracts or commitments which
require it to obtain or maintain a security clearance with any Governmental
Entity.   3.20 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The financial advisor of

applicable Governmental Entity if the Stations are owned or operated outside

the radio stations required to conduct the Company\'s and the Significant
Subsidiaries\' businesses as each is presently conducted.     29   
(b) All reports, fees (including, but not limited to annual regulatory fees)

Authorization; except in each case, where the failure to so maintain, comply

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

(although the failure so to notify the Surviving Corporation shall not
relieve the Surviving Corporation from any liability which the Surviving
Corporation may have under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the Surviving Corporation\'s position with respect to such claim),
and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated
by Section 607.085(b) of the FBCA (the "INDEMNIFICATION Procedure"). The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain no more than one law firm (in
addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to each such matter
unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct (as
determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties), a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties, in which event such additional counsel as may be required may be
retained by the Indemnified Parties.   6.12 NON-SOLICITATION. Except as
