AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Agreement_ ") is made as of April 9,

(the " _Purchaser_ "), MIP Tropic, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the " _Merger Sub_ "), Teridian
Semiconductor Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), GGC Services Holdco, LLC, not individually, but solely in its capacity as
the representative of the Securityholders (the " _Stockholder Representative_
") and Teridian Semiconductor Corporation, a California corporation, solely
for purposes of Article 5 hereof (the " _OpCo_ "). Except as otherwise set
forth herein, capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth in
_Exhibit A_.

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub
and the Company have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporations and stockholders that the Purchaser and the Company
consummate the business combination and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Merger Sub and the Company
have authorized and approved the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the
Company in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the
mutual provisions set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

   

ARTICLE 1 _ 
 THE MERGER_

   

1.1 _The Merger_. In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, the Merger Sub will be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and
into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "). Following the Merger, the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Purchaser (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Merger Sub will cease.

 

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time and Actions at the Closing_. The consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Baker and McKenzie LLP, 660
Hansen Way, Palo Alto, California at a time and date to be specified by the
parties, which will be no later than the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions, set forth in Article 6 (except for
those conditions which in accordance with their terms will be satisfied on
the Closing Date), or at such other time, date and location as the Purchaser
and the Company may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). On the Closing
Date, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement:

 

  

 1. _Effective Time_. The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251(c) of the DGCL (the " _Filing_ "). The time that the Merger becomes effective in accordance with Sections 103 and 251 of the DGCL is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

 

 2. _General Deliveries_. The parties will deliver or cause to be delivered the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Article 6.   

   

 3. _Escrow Agreement and Exchange Agent Agreement_.

   

 1. The Purchaser, the Stockholder Representative and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (the " _Escrow and Exchange Agent_ ") will execute and deliver (A) the Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") and (B) the Exchange Agent Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ").

 

 2. No later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deposit with the Escrow and Exchange Agent via wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate amount of the Net Merger Consideration to be paid to the Securityholders pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 at the Closing, minus (A) the aggregate amount of the Option Payments, (B) the Stockholder Loan Repayment amounts, (C) the Holdback Fund and (D) the Stockholder Rep Expense Fund (the " _Closing Payment_ "), subject to the other specific requirements of Article 2\. Such Closing Payment will be held by the Escrow and Exchange Agent in trust in a separate account under the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") for disbursement as set forth in Section 1.2(d) and Article 2.

 

 3. The Purchaser will establish a separate account with the Escrow and Exchange Agent to hold the Holdback Amount (the " _Holdback Fund_ ") under the Escrow Agreement in trust, which amount will be payable to the Securityholders less (i) any amounts owed to the Purchaser with respect to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2.8 and (ii) any pending or paid indemnification claims asserted pursuant to Article 9, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Holdback Fund will be deemed to have been withheld from each Securityholder in proportion to the Net Merger Consideration otherwise allocable to them. The adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders will thereby constitute approval of the Holdback Fund, the Escrow Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement, the appointment of the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholder Rep Expense Fund.

  

 4. _Payment to Securityholders_. After the Effective Time, following receipt by the Escrow and Exchange Agent of the Closing Payment into the Exchange Fund, the Escrow and Exchange Agent will pay to the Securityholders the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article 2 and other applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement.

  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the
Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and the Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Merger Sub will
become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the
Company, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Merger Sub
will be amended and restated to change the name of the Merger Sub to
"Teridian Semiconductor Holdings Corporation," and, thereupon, the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Merger Sub, as so amended
and restated, will be the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.5 _Directors_. The directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time will
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office
from the Effective Time until their respective     

 successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner
provided in the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation or as otherwise provided by Law.

 

1.6 _Officers_. The officers of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from
the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

  

ARTICLE 2 _ 
 EFFECT OF MERGER; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES_

   

2.1 _Merger Consideration_.

 

  

 1. For the purposes hereof, the following definitions will apply:

   

 1. " _Class L Per Share Preference Amount_ " means the amount of Net Merger Consideration allocable to each Stockholder per share of Class L Common Stock held by it, him or her as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account all applicable deductions, additions and expenses pursuant to and under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including reductions arising out of applicable adjustments), in an amount sufficient to pay and deliver in full on such Class L Common Stock share its pro rata portion of "Unpaid Yield" and "Unreturned Original Cost," as such terms are defined in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 2. " _Holdback Amount_ " means an amount equal to 7.5% of the Net Merger Consideration.

 

 3. " _Merger Consideration_ " means $315,000,000.

 

 4. " _Net Merger Consideration_ " means the Merger Consideration, _plus_ the aggregate exercise price of all outstanding Options, _plus_ the Stockholder Loan Repayment amounts, _plus_ or _minus_ the applicable adjustments, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 2.7, _plus_ Cash.

 

 5. " _Outstanding Company Shares_ " means the sum of (a) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of Class L Common Stock and (c) the aggregate shares attainable upon exercise of Converted Options, in each case issued and/or outstanding, as the case may be, as of the Effective Time.

 

 6. " _Per Share Holdback Amount_ " means the Holdback Fund divided by the Outstanding Company Shares.

 

 7. " _Stockholder Loan Repayment_ " means the aggregate repayment for amounts owed to the Company by any Stockholder.

  

 2. _Conversion/Treatment of Company Capital Stock_.

   

 1. _Preference_. For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each Stockholder holding a share of Class L Common Stock at the Effective Time, each share of Class L Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive a portion of the aggregate Net Merger Consideration in an amount equal to the Class L Per Share Preference Amount. After the Class L Per Share Preference Amount has been paid in full, the Stockholders holding Outstanding      

   

 Company Shares will be entitled to receive a portion of the aggregate Net
Merger Consideration as described in clause (ii) below and as set forth on
the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule.

  

 2. _Class A Common Stock and Class L Common Stock_. For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each Stockholder holding an Outstanding Company Share at the Effective Time, taking into account the Option Payments, all applicable deductions, additions and expenses pursuant to and under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including reductions arising out of applicable adjustments), and following the payment in full of the aggregate Class L Per Share Preference Amount, each Outstanding Company Share will be converted into the right to receive its pro rata portion of the aggregate Net Merger Consideration pursuant to and in accordance with the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule. In all cases the amount to be paid to each holder of Outstanding Company Share for each share held by it, him or her will be rounded down to the nearest whole cent. All Outstanding Company Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each Stockholder holding a certificate representing such Outstanding Company Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration represented by such certificate in accordance with this Article 2.

 

 3. _Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Capital Stock that is owned by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will as of the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 4. _Generally_. All Outstanding Company Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each Stockholder holding a certificate representing such Outstanding Company Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration represented by such certificate in accordance with this Article 2.

 

 5. _Closing Payment_. In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, contemporaneous with the Filing and at the Effective Time, the Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if applicable, (A) the Closing Payment to the Escrow and Exchange Agent, (B) the Holdback Amount to the Escrow and Exchange Agent, (C) the Stockholder Rep Expense Fund to the Stockholder Representative, (D) the Closing Indebtedness (to the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Closing) to the third parties to whom such amounts are owed and (E) the Closing Expenses to the professional advisors who have provided an invoice therefor, which allocations in the cases of (D) and (E) will be as indicated on a schedule or schedules delivered by the Company to the Purchaser no later than two Business Days prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that a Stockholder will have delivered (1) the Transmittal Documentation to the Escrow and Exchange Agent prior to the Closing Date, that portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder will be paid by the Escrow and Exchange Agent to such Stockholder at the Closing out of the Exchange Fund pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement.

  

 3. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Merger Sub will be converted into one validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.   

2.2 _Options and Other Rights to Acquire Company Capital Stock_.

 

  

 1. At the Closing, each outstanding Option, whether or not then vested, will, by virtue of the Closing and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and each outstanding, in-the-money Option that was vested immediately prior to the Closing (" _Converted Options_ ") will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (" _Option Payments_ ") equal to the amount attributable thereto as calculated pursuant to the formula set forth on the options payments schedule prepared by the Company and as set forth on the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule.

 

 2. In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company, the Option Payments to the holders of Options entitled to receive Option Payments pursuant to Section 2.2(a), provided that the payment of any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.2(a) will be (i) subject to any required withholding taxes and will be paid without interest, and (ii) subject to all restrictions on delivery (including without limitation withholding a portion of such amount and depositing such amount into the Holdback Fund based on the number of Outstanding Company Shares that would have been issued upon proper exercise of such Options before the Closing Date) that are placed on the Merger Consideration delivered to holders of Outstanding Company Shares outstanding prior to the Closing Date.

 

 3. Subject to subsection (a) and (b) hereof, the Company will take actions, if any, reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) at the Effective Time, all options, warrants, securities convertible into Company Capital Stock and other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Capital Stock will be cancelled and the Stock Option Plan will be terminated, _provided_ that any such termination will comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A where applicable, (ii) at the Effective Time, no Person other than the holders of the Outstanding Company Shares will have any right, title or interest in or to the ownership of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, (iii) the holders of Outstanding Company Shares and options, warrants or other rights to purchase the Company Capital Stock will, on and after the Closing, have no right, title or interest in or to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any securities of the Company or the Surviving Corporation (other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as expressly provided herein), and (iv) no Person holding any securities of the Company will have any right to acquire any securities of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation by virtue of any such securities of the Company or any act or omission of the Company or its agents.

  

2.3 _Carve-Out Plan_. Prior to the Closing, (a) the Company will establish
a program for certain of its employees (the " _Employee Carve-Out Plan_ ")
which will set aside out of the Net Merger Consideration an amount equal to
an aggregate of $5,000,000 (the " _Carve-Out Funds_ "), and (b) the Purchaser,
the Company and the Stockholder Representative will consult with one another
and cooperate in good faith as to the final form and content of the
Employee Carve-Out Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Closing, the
Carve-out Funds will be available for distribution as described in Section 2.3
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, upon the terms and subject to the
limitations as may be set forth therein.

 1. _Exchange Procedures_. The following exchange procedures will govern the exchange of the Outstanding Company Shares, Options and Warrants at or following the Effective Time:

   

 1. Attached hereto as _Exhibit D-1_ is a preliminary merger consideration allocation schedule prepared by the Company (the " _Preliminary Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule_ ") which sets forth the preliminary allocation of proceeds among the Securityholders.      

   

 The Company expressly acknowledges that (A) the Preliminary Merger
Consideration Allocation Schedule sets forth the contemplated allocation of
the Merger Consideration and other payments payable in accordance with this
Article 2, (B) such allocation (as may be adjusted pursuant hereto) is not
inconsistent with the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or any other
agreements entered into by or among the Company and the Stockholders, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (C) the allocations set
forth on the Preliminary Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule as well as
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders as
reflected therein will in all cases be subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions hereof including, without limitation, Sections 2.7 and
2.8 hereof.

 

 2. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser a spreadsheet setting forth (A) the name and address of each Securityholder as of the Closing Date, (B) the number of shares and stock certificate numbers of Outstanding Company Shares, and to the extent applicable, the aggregate number of shares of Converted Options and the corresponding Option Payment related thereto, held by such Securityholder, (C) the portion of the Net Merger Consideration and the Closing Payment payable to such Securityholder in accordance with the provisions hereof as of the Closing Date on a gross basis and, with respect to any portion of the Closing Payment payable to employees or former employees of the Company, net of withholding basis, (D) each Securityholder\'s proportional interest in the Holdback Fund, and (E) each eligible Securityholder\'s proportional interest in the Employee Carve-Out Plan pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, net of withholding (such spreadsheet, the " _Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule_ "). Upon receipt by the Purchaser and approval thereof (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule will be appended to this Agreement as _ExhibitD-2_ hereto and appended as an appropriately numbered exhibit to the Escrow Agreement and Exchange Agent Agreement (and the Preliminary Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule for all purposes will have no further force or effect). In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Article 2 with respect to any portion of the Net Merger Consideration payable to any Securityholder, the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule will prevail.

 

 3. At the Effective Time, with reference to Section 1.2(c) the Purchaser will deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the Stockholders that do not receive payment of a portion of the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(v), cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Closing Payment (minus any amounts that would be payable in respect of Dissenting Shares and amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(v)). The Exchange Agent will make the payments after the Effective Time provided for in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement.

 

 4. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent will cooperate to deliver or mail to each Stockholder at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date a letter of transmittal and instructions in the form attached to the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Transmittal Letter_ ") for use in surrendering certificates evidencing such Stockholder\'s Outstanding Company Shares and receiving the consideration to which such Stockholder will be entitled pursuant to the provisions hereof, and if the Exchange Agent (or the Company, on its behalf) receives prior to the Closing Date such duly executed Transmittal Letter and a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any Outstanding Company Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") (or an effective affidavit of loss required by Section 2.4(b)) (collectively, the " _Transmittal Documentation_ "), it will pay such Stockholder its      

   

 portion of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date contemporaneous with
the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement.

  

 5. Upon delivery to the Escrow and Exchange Agent after the Effective Time of the Transmittal Documentation, no later than three Business Days after such receipt, the Escrow and Exchange Agent will pay the applicable Stockholder, in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, such allocable portion of the Merger Consideration as it has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, all as set forth in the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule, subject to any required Tax withholding, and upon such payment the surrendered Certificate will immediately be cancelled.

 

 6. Until surrendered in accordance with the immediately preceding clauses, each Certificate (other than stock certificates representing Dissenting Shares or shares of Company Capital Stock owned by the Company) will represent solely the right to receive the relevant portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration relating thereto out of the Exchange Fund (and out of the Escrow Fund, if applicable). No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger Consideration. If all or any portion of any merger consideration is to be delivered to any Person other than the Person in whose name the stock certificate formerly representing shares of Outstanding Company Stock surrendered therefore is registered, it will be a condition to such right to receive such merger consideration that the stock certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person surrendering such stock certificates will pay to the Escrow and Exchange Agent (or the Company, as applicable) any transfer or other Taxes and expenses required by reason of the payment of such merger consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the stock certificate surrendered, or will establish to the satisfaction of the Escrow and Exchange Agent (and the Company, if applicable) that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

 2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Escrow and Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration in respect thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate (i) to provide an affidavit of such loss, theft or destruction in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow and Exchange Agent and any additional documentation reasonably requested by the Escrow and Exchange Agent, (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Surviving Corporation from and against any claim that may be made against them with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and (iii) to provide a sufficient indemnity bond in form, substance and amount satisfactory to the Escrow and Exchange Agent.

 

 3. _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this Section 2.4 will also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 2.4 will commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1.

 

 4. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Any Merger Consideration, payments paid or issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates and there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 5. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed on the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time (other than such portions as     

 

 may correspond to Dissenting Shares) will be delivered to the Purchaser, and
any holder of a Certificate who has not previously complied with this Section
2.3 (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) will be entitled to receive,
upon demand, only from the Purchaser, payment of its claim for the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  

2.5 _Escheat_. None of the Purchaser, the Escrow and Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation will be liable to any former holder of Company Capital
Stock for any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. In the event any Certificate has not been surrendered for exchange prior
to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or prior to such earlier date
as of which such Certificate or the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, then the Merger Consideration otherwise payable upon
the surrender of such Certificate will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Securityholders (payable to them by the
Escrow and Exchange Agent in accordance with their respective allocable
portions of the Merger Consideration, as set forth in the Final Merger
Consideration Allocation Schedule), free and clear of all rights, interests
and adverse claims of any person.

 

2.6 _Dissenter\'s Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised the
holder\'s appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or any
successor provision (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless and until
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such
holder\'s right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal, then such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled, without
interest or dividends thereon, upon the surrender of the Certificate(s) which
formerly represented such Dissenting Shares, in the manner provided in Section
2.4. The Company will give the Stockholder Representative and Purchaser
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Capital Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to Stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL will be subject to the
requirements of Section 9.4 below as though the Stockholder Representative
were the Indemnifying Party pursuant thereto. No party will make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment,
except with the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
consent will not be withheld, conditioned or delayed unreasonably.

  

2.7 _Pre-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

 

  

 1. _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an unaudited consolidated balance sheet (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of a date within three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with the formula and GAAP standards and classifications, applied in a manner consistent with the accounting principles used for the preparation of the Financial Statements (the " _Company Accounting Principles_ ") set forth on the working capital schedule prepared by the Company and attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (the " _Working Capital Schedule_ "), and will be accompanied by a certificate based on such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet setting forth the Company\'s itemized good faith calculation of (A) the Closing Working Capital, (B) the Closing Indebtedness, (C) the Closing Expenses (along with, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), reasonable identification of each creditor to whom such amounts are owed), and (D) the amount of the     

  

 adjustment(s), if any, calculated in accordance with Section 2.7(b) hereof
(the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Certificate_ ").

  

 2. _Adjustment_.

   

 1. _Estimated Closing Working Capital_. If the Closing Working Capital stated in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Certificate (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") is less than the Collar Low Mark, the Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing will be reduced by an amount equal to the positive difference between such Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Target Working Capital. If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than the Collar High Mark, the Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing will be increased by an amount equal to the positive difference between such Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Target Working Capital. In the event the Estimated Closing Working Capital neither exceeds the Collar High Mark nor is less than the Collar Low Mark, there will be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing arising out of the calculation of Closing Working Capital.

 

 2. _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_. If the Closing Indebtedness stated in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Certificate (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") is greater than zero, the Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing will be reduced by an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness (and such amount of Estimated Closing Indebtedness will be diverted from the Merger Consideration to the payment at Closing of Closing Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(v)).

 

 3. _Closing Expenses_. The Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing will be reduced by an amount equal to the Closing Expenses as set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Certificate (the " _Estimated Closing Expenses_ ") (and such amount of Estimated Closing Expenses will be diverted from the Merger Consideration to the payment at Closing of such Closing Expenses pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(v)).

 

  

2.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

  

 1. As soon as commercially practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will in good faith prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow and Exchange Agent in the event the Purchaser claims that it is entitled to payment pursuant to Section 2.8(f)) written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) the Purchaser\'s good faith calculation of Closing Working Capital (the " _Final Closing Working Capital_ "), Closing Indebtedness (the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ") and Closing Expenses (the " _Final Closing Expenses_ ") based on the Closing Balance Sheet, and (iii) the Purchaser\'s good faith calculation of the amount of any payments required pursuant to Section 2.8(f) (the " _Adjustment Calculation_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles.

 

 2. Within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the Stockholder Representative will deliver to the Purchaser (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow and Exchange Agent if the Purchaser claims in the Adjustment Notice that it is entitled to payment pursuant to Section 2.8(f)) a written response in which the Stockholder Representative will either:

   

 1. agree in writing with the Adjustment Calculation, in which case such calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.8(f); or

      

   

 2. dispute the Adjustment Calculation by delivering to the Purchaser a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the good faith basis for each such disputed item.

  

 3. If the Stockholder Representative fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Securityholders will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Adjustment Calculation, in which case, the Adjustment Calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.8(f).

 

 4. If the Stockholder Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will attempt in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to agree on the Adjustment Calculation for purposes of Section 2.8(f). Until the final determination of the purchase price adjustments accordance with this Section 2.8, the Stockholder Representative and its agents will be provided with such reasonable access to the financial books and records of the Company and the Surviving Corporation during regular business hours and such other good faith, reasonable cooperation from Purchaser as it may reasonably request to enable it to review and evaluate the Purchaser\'s preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Purchaser\'s determination of Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Expenses, and to prepare and respond to the Adjustment Notice and the Adjustment Calculation. Any written resolution by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative during such 30-day period as to any disputed items will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.8(f). If the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative do not resolve all disputed items by the end of 30 days after the date of delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will submit for resolution the remaining items in dispute to KPMG, or if KPMG is unable or unwilling to be engaged (or if a party reasonably determines that KPMG does not at such time have the necessary independence to deliver a fair resolution), then a mutually agreeable independent accounting firm of recognized standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser or the Company. If the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable to jointly select such independent accounting firm within 10 days after such 30-day period, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, will each select an independent accounting firm of recognized standing and each such selected accounting firm will promptly select a third independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser or the Company; ___provided_ , _however_ , that if either the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, fail to select such independent accounting firm during this 10-day period, then the parties agree that the independent accounting firm selected by the other party will be the independent accounting firm selected by the parties for purposes of this Section 2.8 (such selected independent accounting firm, whether pursuant to this sentence or the preceding sentence, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report that specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting Firm as to each item in dispute and the resulting Adjustment Calculation, it being understood and agreed that the Independent Accounting Firm will evaluate and determine the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles. The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination within 30 days after referral of the items to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. The Independent Accounting Firm\'s determination of the Adjustment Calculation (including the Final Closing Working Capital in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles) as set forth in its report will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.8(f). The parties will revise and agree upon the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Expenses as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.8(d) and the Purchaser will provide instructions to the Escrow and Exchange Agent consistent with such resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent     

  

 Accounting Firm will be shared by the Purchaser and the Securityholders in
inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined
to be for the account of the Purchaser and the Securityholders, respectively,
and the Securityholders\' portion of such cost will be paid pursuant to
Section 2.8(f) below.

  

 5. For purposes of complying with this Section 2.8, the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accounting Firm may request and are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative may require that the Independent Accounting Firm enter into a customary and reasonable form of confidentiality agreement with respect to the work papers and other documents and information regarding the Company provided to the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.8.

  

 6. Following the final determination of each of Final Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Expenses pursuant to this Section 2.8, the Purchaser and the Securityholders will be entitled to recover as follows:

   

 1. In the event that the Estimated Closing Working Capital was less than the Collar Low Mark, then the following will apply:

   

 1. if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, then the Purchaser will be entitled to recover an amount equal to the positive difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing Working Capital; and

 

 2. if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, then the Securityholders will be entitled to recover as follows:

    

(x) if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Collar Low Mark, an
amount equal to the positive difference between such Final Closing Working
Capital and the Estimated Closing Working Capital;

 

(y) if the Final Closing Working Capital is not less than the Collar Low Mark
and not greater than the Collar High Mark, the full amount by which the
Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing was reduced at Closing pursuant
to Section 2.7(b)(i); and

 

(z) if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Collar High Mark,
the sum of (1) the full amount by which the Merger Consideration payable as
of the Closing was reduced at Closing pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(i) and (2) an
amount equal to the positive difference between such Final Closing Working
Capital and the Target Working Capital.

          

   

 2. In the event that the Estimated Closing Working Capital was greater than the Collar High Mark, then the following will apply:

   

 1. if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, then the Securityholders will be entitled to recover an amount equal to the positive difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing Working Capital; and

 

 2. if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, then the Purchaser will be entitled to recover as follows:

    

(x) if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Collar High Mark,
an amount equal to the positive difference between such Final Closing Working
Capital and the Estimated Closing Working Capital;

 

(y) if the Final Closing Working Capital is not greater than the Collar High
Mark and not less than the Collar Low Mark, the full amount by which the
Merger Consideration payable as of the Closing was increased at Closing
pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(i); and

 

(z) if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Collar Low Mark, the
sum of (1) the full amount by which the Merger Consideration payable as of
the Closing was increased at Closing pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(i) and (2) an
amount equal to the positive difference between such Final Closing Working
Capital and the Target Working Capital.

     

 3. In the event that the Estimated Closing Working Capital was greater than the Collar Low Mark and less than the Collar High Mark, then the following will apply:

    

 1. if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Collar Low Mark, then Purchaser will be entitled to recover an amount equal to the positive difference between Target Working Capital and such Final Closing Working Capital;

 

 2. if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Collar High Mark, then the Securityholders will be entitled to recover an amount equal to the positive difference between Target Working Capital and such Final Closing Working Capital; and

 

 3. if the Final Closing Working Capital is not less than the Collar Low Mark and not greater than the Collar High Mark, no adjustment will be made hereunder.

  

 4. if the Final Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then the Purchaser will be entitled to recover an amount equal to such positive difference;

 

 5. if the Final Closing Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then the Securityholders will be entitled to recover an amount equal to such positive difference;

      

   

 6. if the Final Closing Expenses is greater than the Estimated Closing Expenses, then the Purchaser will be entitled to recover an amount equal to such positive difference; and

 

 7. if the Final Closing Expenses is less than the Estimated Closing Expenses, then the Securityholders will be entitled to recover an amount equal to such positive difference.

  

Any recovery pursuant to this Section 2.8(f) will include interest thereon
(calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed in a year consisting
of 365 days) from the Closing Date through and including the date of such
payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal Western Edition_ and in effect on the date of such payment. In
the event of an adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.8(f), the Purchaser and
Stockholder Representative will prepare a joint written instruction to the
Escrow and Exchange Agent in respect thereof, after taking due account of the
cost of the Independent Accounting Firms\' review and report (if any) pursuant
to and in accordance with the final sentence of Section 2.8(d). If such
adjustment is in favor of the Purchaser, then the Purchaser will be entitled
to recover such amount from the Holdback Fund in accordance with the
provisions hereof. If such adjustment is in favor of the
Securityholders, then the Purchaser will promptly (and in no event later than
two Business Days following such determination) pay to the Escrow and
Exchange Agent (on behalf of, and for prompt distribution by the Escrow and
Exchange Agent in accordance with the Exchange Agreement to,
the Securityholders) an amount equal to such adjustment.

 

 7. The purpose of this Section 2.8 is to determine the final Merger Consideration to be paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement. Accordingly, any adjustment pursuant hereto will neither be deemed to be an indemnification pursuant to Article 9, nor preclude the Purchaser from exercising any indemnification rights pursuant to Article 9 hereof, subject to Section 9.9(d). Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.8 will be treated by the parties for all purposes as an increase or decrease in the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, and will not be subject to offset for any reason.

  

2.9 _Release of Holdback Fund_. The Holdback Fund may be reduced from time
to time in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement. The
balance of the Holdback Fund will be paid and automatically released by the
Escrow and Exchange Agent upon the date that is 12 months after the Closing
Date (the " _Holdback Release Date_ ") pursuant to, and in accordance with,
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to the Securityholders (to be
distributed in accordance with the Final Merger Consideration Allocation
Schedule). To the extent that on the Holdback Release Date any amount has been
reserved and withheld from distribution from the Holdback Fund on account of
an unresolved claim for indemnification and, subsequent to the Holdback
Release Date, such claim is resolved, the parties will promptly direct the
Escrow and Exchange Agent to release (i) to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party the amount of Losses, if any, due in respect of such claim as finally
determined, and (ii) to the Securityholders (to be distributed in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement), an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of the amount theretofore reserved and withheld from distribution at
the Holdback Release Date in respect of such claim over the payment, if any,
made pursuant to the foregoing clause (i).

  

2.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is required by this Agreement to be
taken to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession
to, all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company, the officers and directors of the Company will, and are hereby
authorized to, take such action as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser to the extent lawful and reasonably practicable.

 

2.11 _Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of
the Purchaser, the Company, the Escrow and Exchange Agent and the Stockholder
Representative will have the right to     

 withhold all Taxes from payments to be made by it hereunder (including
without limitation any payments in connection with the Escrow Agreement and
the Exchange Agent Agreement) if such withholding is required by law, and to
collect Forms W-8 or W-9 or other forms from the Stockholders to the extent
required by any applicable Law.

 3. The Company does not own or control directly or indirectly any equity, participation or similar interest in any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, or other business association which is not a Subsidiary.

Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party and to perform the
Company\'s obligations under this Agreement and each such Ancillary
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary action on
the part of the Company subject only to approval by the holders of a majority
of the votes represented by the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock
entitled to vote on this Agreement and the Merger, voting as a single class

5.5 _No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. The Purchaser will not take
any action with respect to the Company that would knowingly cause the
Transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is
the same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax

discussions or negotiations; in each case regarding any business combination
transaction involving the Company or any other transaction to acquire all or
any part of the assets (including, without limitation, Intellectual
Property), business or properties (but in all cases excluding the sale of
inventory and licenses in the ordinary course of business) of the Company or
any amount of the capital stock of the Company     

 (whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of assets,
purchase of stock, tender offer, license or otherwise, other than with the
Purchaser. The Company and the OpCo will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any such negotiations, discussion or Contracts (other than with the
Purchaser) that are the subject of clauses (a) or (b) above and will
immediately cease providing and deliver notice for the return or destruction
of any non-public information and terminate any access of the type referenced
in clause (c) above. If the Company, OpCo or any of their respective

advisors and representatives receives, prior to the Closing, any offer,
proposal or request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in clause
(a) or (b) above or any request for disclosure or access as referenced in
clause (c) above, the Company, OpCo or such Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, consultants or other advisors and representatives will
immediately suspend any discussions with such offeror or Person with regard
to such offers, proposals or requests and notify the Purchaser that an
offer, proposal or request has been received, and will indicate to the
Purchaser whether or not such offer, proposal or request is made by or
on behalf of a Person identified on Section 5.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the material terms of such offer or proposal, as the case may
be.

  

5.7 _Confidentiality_.

 

  

 1. For purposes of securities law compliance, each party agrees not to issue any press release or make any other public announcement relating to this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, except that each of the Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder Representative reserves the right to make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or securities listing standards (in which case each of the Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder Representative will consult with one another prior to any such disclosure as to the form and content of such disclosure). Following such public disclosure by one party, the other parties will have the right to issue press releases or make any other public announcements not inconsistent with the contents of such public disclosure.

 

 2. Each party agrees to continue to abide by that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of February 2, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated by reference in this Agreement and which terms will survive until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Except as contemplated by Section 5.6(a), the existence of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreement and the terms hereof and thereof (including the exhibits and schedules appended hereto) will be deemed "Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement. Beginning on the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will waive affirmatively any right under any nondisclosure agreement previously entered into by the Company and any other Person with respect to the evaluation of the sale of the Company without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.

  

5.8 _Section 280G Matters_. No later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser reasonably detailed
information setting forth all persons who may be "disqualified individuals"
as described below and who may be receiving payments or benefits in connection
with the Merger (under this Agreement, the Employee Carve-Out Plan or any
other contract, plan or arrangement with the Company or otherwise, including
severance payments, and acceleration of vesting or benefits under options or
restricted stock). If for any reason it reasonably appears to the Purchaser
that a disqualified individual will receive an excess parachute payment, then
the balance of this Section 5.8 will apply. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company will submit to a stockholder vote or written consent approving
the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of
the Code) to receive or retain any and all payments that would be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, in a manner which
complies with Section 280G of the Code and all applicable     

 final regulations thereunder (the " _280G Approval_ "). Prior to the
delivery to the stockholders of the Company of documents to be delivered to
the stockholders in connection with the 280G Approval, the Company will have
given the Purchaser and its counsel a reasonable opportunity, but in any
event no fewer than three Business Days, to review and comment on final drafts
of all such documents.

  

5.9 _Stockholder Materials_. Within five Business Days of the execution of
this Agreement, the Company will deliver an information statement, the form
of written consent required pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and
all information that may be required to be given to the Stockholders pursuant
to the DGCL in connection with the Merger, including, to the
extent applicable, adequate notice of the Merger and information concerning
dissenters\' rights under the DGCL (the " _Stockholder Materials_ ") to all
Stockholders entitled to receive such under the DGCL. Prior to the delivery of
the Stockholder Materials, the Company will have given the Purchaser and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity (but in no event fewer than two Business
Days) to review a reasonably final draft of the Stockholder Materials. The
form of written consent will include language to the effect that each
consenting Stockholder agrees to be bound by the indemnification provisions
of Article 9 of this Agreement applicable to them as if the
consenting Stockholder were a signatory to this Agreement and will otherwise
be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.
The Stockholder Materials will also specify the address to which any notices
concerning dissenters\' rights must be sent and will request that a copy of
such notice be sent to the Purchaser at an address specified by the Purchaser.
At the time it is sent and at all times subsequent thereto (through and
including the Effective Time), the Stockholder Materials will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, not misleading; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company will not
be responsible for information about the Purchaser which is accurately stated
from information which the Purchaser has publicly released or filed or
otherwise not objected to by the Purchaser or its representatives (including
counsel), in writing, in connection with its above-stated review. If, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any event or information should be
discovered by the Company which must legally be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Stockholder Materials, then the Company will
promptly inform the Purchaser of such occurrence, and the Company will
deliver to the Stockholders such amendment or supplement. The
Stockholder Materials will include the recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company in favor of this Agreement and the Merger and
the conclusion of the board of directors of the Company that the terms and
conditions of the Merger are fair and reasonable to, and in the
best interests of, the Stockholders.

 

5.10 _Meeting or Consent of Stockholders_. The Company will within 15
Business Days after the date hereof take all action necessary in accordance
with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to deliver a
solicitation for the written consent of the Stockholders to approve this
Agreement and the Merger. The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain promptly from all of the Stockholders written consents in
favor of the Merger and take all other action necessary to secure the
approval of all such Stockholders.

 

5.11 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Each of the parties hereto will
use its best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the conditions
precedent which are set forth in Article 6, and each of the parties hereto
will use its best efforts to cause the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement to be consummated, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to obtain all (a) of the Governmental Authorizations and consents
listed in Section 6.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (b)
authorizations of third parties, and to make all filings with, and give all
notices to, third parties which may be necessary or reasonably required on its
part in order to effect the transactions contemplated herein.

 

5.12 _401(k) Plan_. On or prior to the day preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, if requested by the Purchaser at least five days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver     

 to the Purchaser resolutions of the board of directors of the Company
approving the termination of the Company\'s 401(k) plan, effective on the day
preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

  

5.13 _Customs Report_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the
OpCo will prepare and submit a voluntary self-disclosure to U.S. Customs and
Border Protection at the port of Los Angeles International Airport in
accordance with 19 USC 1592(c)(4) and 19 CFR 162.74 regarding the
undervaluation of certain entries of integrated circuits, if any. Such
voluntary self-disclosure will be prepared and submitted, and any payment
will be made in connection therewith, by the OpCo following consultation with
the Purchaser. The Purchaser and Merger Sub will cooperate reasonably with
OpCo and the Company in the preparation and submission of such voluntary self-
disclosure.

of the actions or omissions of the Purchaser occurring on and after the

8.4 _D andO_. For a period of six years after the Closing, the Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not amend, repeal or modify (in a manner
adverse to the beneficiary thereof) any provision in the Company\'s or any of
its Subsidiaries\' respective charters or bylaws relating to exculpation or
indemnification of any officers or directors, it being the intent of the
parties that the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on the date hereof will continue to be entitled to such exculpation
and indemnification to the fullest extent of the Law. After the Closing, the
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, at the election and sole
expense of the Stockholder Representative, continue to provide any Person who
is on the date hereof, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, officers\' and directors\' liability insurance coverage (" _D andO
Insurance_") with respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including attorney\'s fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a " _D andO
Claim_") to the extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of,
(a) the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the     

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise at any time prior to the Closing
Date, or (b) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby in each case to the extent that any such claim pertains to any matter
or fact arising, existing, or occurring prior to or at the Closing Date,
regardless of whether such claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing Date, which coverage will be substantially similar to the
Company and its Subsidiaries\' (as applicable) existing DandO Insurance, with
an overall coverage amount not less than the overall coverage amount under
such existing DandO Insurance.

  

ARTICLE 9 _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION_

   

9.1 _Indemnification by the Securityholders_. In the event that the Closing
occurs, and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 9.6
hereof, the Securityholders will have an obligation, on an individual basis
solely in proportion to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to them
pursuant to this Agreement, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser, each of the Purchaser\'s Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation and
each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants,
advisors, representatives and equity holders (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and will pay to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties the monetary value of, any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting
from any of the following:

 

  

 1. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 2. the nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company required to be fulfilled or performed at or prior to the Effective Time contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by the Company pursuant hereto;

 

 3. any action taken by the Stockholder Representative which the Stockholder Representative is not authorized to take under Section 11.1 hereof;

 

 4. any failure of any Securityholder to have good, valid and marketable title to the issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or Options issued in the name of such holder free and clear of all Encumbrances; and

 

 5. any assertion or recovery by any Stockholder of the fair value, interest, and expenses or other amounts pursuant to dissenters\' rights exercised or purportedly exercised pursuant to the DGCL (it being understood that any such Losses will not include the pro rata share of the Merger Consideration such asserting or recovering Stockholder would have received pursuant to this Agreement).

  

For purposes of determining under this Section 9.1 whether there is any
inaccuracy in, or whether the Company has breached, any such representation,
warranty or covenant, and the amount of any Losses associated therewith, the
parties agree that all references to "material," "materially" or
"materiality," or to whether a breach would have a "Material Adverse Effect"
contained in the Specified Representations will be disregarded for purposes of
calculating such Losses (although any such qualifications will be taken into
account for purposes of determining the existence of such an inaccuracy or
breach and whether such representation or warranty has been inaccurate or
breached in the first instance).   

9.2 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. In the event that the Closing
occurs, and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 9.6
hereof, the Purchaser will have an obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Securityholders (and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, representatives and equity
holders) from and against, and will pay to the Securityholders the monetary
value of, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the
Securityholders (including each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, consultants, advisors, representatives and equity holders)
directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or resulting from any of
the following:

 

  

 1. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement; and

 

 2. the nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto.

  

For purposes of determining under this Section 9.2 whether there is any
inaccuracy in, or whether the Purchaser or the Merger Sub has breached, any
such representation, warranty or covenant, and the amount of any Losses
associated therewith, the parties agree (i) that all references to
"material," "materially" or "materiality," or to whether a breach would have a
"Material Adverse Effect" will be disregarded and (ii) that the
representations, warranties and covenants are made for purposes of this
Section 9.2 as if those disregarded words were not included.

 

9.3 _Claim Procedure_.

 

  

 1. A party that seeks indemnity under this Article 9 (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") containing reasonably and in good faith (i) a description and the estimated amount to the extent determinable of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of those Losses.

 

 2. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party will either:

   

 1. agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses at issue in the Claim Notice; or

 

 2. dispute the Indemnified Party\'s entitlement to indemnification by delivering to the Indemnified Party a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") setting forth each disputed item and the good faith, reasonable basis for disputing each such disputed item.

  

 3. If the Indemnifying Party fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice.

 

 4. If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the dispute may be resolved by any legally available means consistent with the provisions of Section 11.11.

     

  

 5. If any Purchaser Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, the parties will contemporaneously deliver to the Escrow and Exchange Agent copies of each Claim Notice and Objection Notice in connection with such claim.

 

 6. Any indemnification of the Securityholders pursuant to this Article 9 will be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Stockholder Representative. All indemnification payments to be received by the Securityholders in accordance with this Article 9 will be allocated among the Stockholders in proportion to each Securityholder\'s pro rata share of the Holdback Fund as set forth on the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule.

 

 7. The foregoing indemnification payments will be made within 10 Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such payments are determined by mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) the amount of such payments are determined pursuant to Section 9.3(c) if an Objection Notice has not been timely delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(b) or (iii) both such amount and the Indemnifying Party\'s obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over such proceeding as permitted by Section 11.11 if an Objection Notice has been timely delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(b) (the " _Settlement Date_ ").

  

For purposes of Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, (i) if the Securityholders
comprise the Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party
(except provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) will be deemed to refer to the Stockholder Representative and (ii)
if the Securityholders comprise the Indemnified Party, any references to the
Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make or a
right to receive any payments) will be deemed to refer to the Stockholder
Representative.

  

9.4 _Third Party Claims_.

 

  

 1. In the event that the Indemnified Party is entitled, or is seeking to assert rights, to indemnification under this Article 9 relating to a claim by another Person, then the Indemnified Party will promptly deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party and will include in such Claim Notice (i) notice of the commencement of any Proceeding relating to such claim promptly, but in any event within 30 days, after the Indemnified Party has received written notice of the commencement of such Proceeding or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, (ii) the facts constituting the basis for such Proceeding and the amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each case to the extent known to the Indemnified Party and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement under which such rights are claimed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is or has been prejudiced or has suffered actual Losses directly caused by the delay or other deficiency.

 

 2. Within 30 days after the Indemnified Party\'s delivery of notice of the commencement of such Proceeding under this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Party may assume control of the defense of such Proceeding by giving to the Indemnified Party written notice of the intention to assume such defense, but if and only if the Indemnifying Party further:

   

 1. acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that (A) any Losses actually recovered by such other Person and any additional amounts that may be claimed by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith constitute Losses for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified pursuant to this Article 9, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party may contest the computation or validity of Losses so claimed by such Indemnified Party (but not its obligation to      

   

 indemnify hereunder in light of the nature of such Losses and/or the matter
giving rise thereto), and (B) the Indemnifying Party will advance all
expenses and costs of defense; and

  

 2. retains counsel for the defense of such Proceeding reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and furnishes to the Indemnified Party evidence satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has and will have sufficient financial resources to fund on a current basis the cost of such defense and paying all Losses that may arise under the claim.

  

However, in the event that the Securityholders are the Indemnifying Party, in
no event may the Indemnifying Party assume or maintain control of the defense
of any Proceeding (A) involving criminal liability, (B) involving claims to
the extent relating to any Company Intellectual Property or the Intellectual
Property of another Person, (C) in which any relief other than monetary
damages is sought against the Indemnified Party, or (D) in which the outcome
of any Judgment or settlement in the matter could materially adversely affect
the business of any of (I) the Purchaser, (II) the business unit of the
Purchaser that acquires the Company, or (III) the Company or the Surviving
Corporation. An Indemnifying Party will lose any previously acquired right to
control the defense of any Proceeding if for any reason the Indemnifying
Party ceases to actively, competently and diligently conduct the defense.

 

 3. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not able to, assume or maintain control of such defense in compliance with Section 9.4(b), the Indemnified Party will have the right to control such defense. If the Indemnified Party controls such defense, the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay to the Indemnified Party promptly upon demand from time to time all reasonable, documented attorneys\' fees and other costs and expenses of defense. The party not controlling such defense (the " _Noncontrolling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense. However, if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party mutually and reasonably conclude that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Proceeding, then the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel to the Indemnified Party (reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) will be considered and included as "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement solely to the extent necessary to represent the Indemnified Party\'s interests in the conduct of such defense arising solely with respect to such conflicting interest. The party controlling such defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") will reasonably advise the Noncontrolling Party of the status of such Proceeding and the defense thereof and will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise reasonably and in good faith cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Proceeding.

 

 4. The Indemnified Party will not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent it will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. The Indemnifying Party will have no Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, any such Proceeding effected without its consent unless such consent was withheld, conditioned or delayed unreasonably.

 

 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.12, each party consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought by another Person against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that such Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect to the Proceeding or the matters alleged therein. Each party agrees that process may be served on it with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.   

9.5 _Survival_.

 

  

 1. All representations and warranties, and covenants to be performed, contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date (the " _Indemnification Period_ "), other than the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.5(c), which will terminate as of the Closing.

 

 2. If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of the Indemnification Period applicable to a representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of any such representation or warranty, or a notice that, as a result of a Proceeding instituted or claim made by a Person that is not an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur Losses, then the applicable representation or warranty will survive only for purposes of the resolution of the matter covered by such notice until the resolution thereof (subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement). If the Proceeding or written claim with respect to which such notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved, the Indemnified Party will promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.

  

9.6 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

  

 1. The rights of a Purchaser Indemnified Party to assert claims against the Holdback Fund under this Article 9 will be the sole and exclusive remedy of a Purchaser Indemnified Party for any indemnification claims in respect of this Agreement (other than with respect to any injunctive relief available to any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any rights a Purchaser Indemnified Party may have against a particular Securityholder with respect to such representations and warranties of the Securityholder as are set forth in the Transmittal Letter executed and delivered by such Securityholder) and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have no other rights or remedies for money damages in connection with any breach of this Agreement or any other Loss arising out of the negotiation, entry into or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no Securityholder will have any liability in excess of its pro rata share of the then remaining amount in the Holdback Fund (in each case other than with respect to such representations set forth in such Securityholder\'s Transmittal Letter). After the Closing Date, no party may seek the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 2. The Holdback Fund will be the sole and exclusive source for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to recover Losses for which they may be entitled under this Article 9.

 

 3. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not have any rights to indemnification under this Agreement unless and until all aggregate Losses subject to such indemnification collectively exceed $750,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), whereupon such indemnification will thereafter be available (subject to the other provisions of this Agreement) solely with respect to the amount of such Losses that exceed the Threshold; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Threshold will not apply to (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 3.4 or (ii) the matters described in Sections 9.1(c) through 9.1(f) hereof (and Losses pursuant to any inaccuracy in or breach of such representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 3.4 or the matters described in Sections 9.1(c) through 9.1(f) will not count toward the Threshold).

 

 4. In no event will the Purchaser\'s Liability under this Agreement exceed the amount of the Merger Consideration.

     

  

 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement limits the Liability of a party to another party for fraud by such party.

  

9.7 _No Right of Indemnification or Contribution_. No Securityholder has any
right of indemnification or contribution against the Company with respect to
any breach by the Securityholders of any of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, whether
by virtue of any contractual or statutory right of indemnity or otherwise,
and all claims to the contrary are hereby waived and released.

 

9.8 _Exercise of Remedies by Purchaser Indemnified Parties other than the
Purchaser_. No Purchaser Indemnified Party (other than the Purchaser or any
successor or assignee of the Purchaser) is entitled to assert any
indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement
unless the Purchaser (or any successor or assignee of the Purchaser) consents
to the assertion of the indemnification claim or the exercise of any other
remedy. No Securityholder is entitled to assert any indemnification claim
or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless the Stockholder
Representative consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim or the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

9.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments; Net Recovery; Exclusive Remedy;
Mitigation_.

 

  

 1. All indemnification payments arising hereunder will be deemed adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes.

 

 2. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under Article 9 will be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss under insurance policies or other third-party sources of reimbursement or indemnification so long as such recoverable amounts are pursued by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in good faith, otherwise the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under Article 9 will be net of any amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party, in each instance net of any deductible amount paid by such Indemnified Party in connection with such insurance recovery. The amount of any Loss claimed by any Indemnified Party hereunder will be reduced to the extent of any tax savings or benefits realizable by any Indemnified Party which is attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other tax benefit resulting from or arising out of such Loss. The amount of any Loss claimed by any Indemnified Party hereunder will be reduced to the extent the Indemnified Party may recover any amounts from third parties with respect to the matters relating to such Loss. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment required pursuant to Article 9 is finally determined after such payment, the Indemnified Party will repay the Indemnifying Party promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after such final determination) any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to such provision had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

 

 3. The Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company) to, take commercially reasonable steps, viewed in light of the then-applicable business conditions of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, to mitigate any Losses as soon as reasonably practicable after any Purchaser Indemnified Party becomes aware of any event which does, or would reasonably be expected to, give rise to any such Losses.

 

 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Securityholder will have any liability with respect to any Losses under this Article 9 arising out of, resulting from, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by any Liability (i) to the extent but only to the extent that the Liability giving rise to such Loss (or a part thereof) with respect to such matter has been taken into account in the determination of Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness or     

  

 Final Closing Expenses, each as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8,
or (ii) that is the subject matter of Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

   

ARTICLE 10 _ 
 TAX MATTERS_

   

10.1 _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Purchaser, the Company and the
Stockholder Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 

10.2 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. Any tax sharing agreements or arrangements to
which the Company or any Subsidiary may be a party or have liability will be
terminated effective as of the Closing. After the Closing, neither the
Securityholders nor their Affiliates will have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder, and this Agreement will be the sole Tax sharing
agreement relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods
beginning before the Closing.

 

10.3 _Powers of Attorney_. Any power of attorney or similar agreement to
which the Company or any Subsidiary may be a party with respect to Taxes will
be terminated effective as of the Closing.

  

ARTICLE 11 _ 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS_

   

11.1 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

  

 1. By virtue of its approval of the Merger or submission of the Transmittal Documentation (as applicable), each Securityholder designates and appoints the Stockholder Representative as such Securityholder\'s agent and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to take any and all actions that the Stockholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the Securityholder, as fully as if each Securityholder was acting on its own behalf, including, without limitation, full power and authority on such Securityholder\'s behalf (i) to give and receive notices and communications, to accept service of process on behalf of such Securityholder pursuant to Section 11.11, (ii) to authorize, negotiate, compromise, settle, agree to and otherwise handle any adjustments to the Merger Consideration under Section 2.7 and Section 2.8 and other applicable provisions of this Agreement, (iii) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with Judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards of arbitrators, with respect to, any claims by any Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Securityholder or by any Securityholder against any Purchaser Indemnified Party, or any other dispute between any Purchaser Indemnified Party and any Securityholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (v) to pay such Securityholder\'s portion of the Closing Expenses (whether incurred on or after the date hereof) and to retain amounts from the Merger Consideration for the purpose of paying expenses incurred by it pursuant to matters arising out of this Agreement or satisfying any post-Closing adjustment(s) to the Merger Consideration, (vi) to disburse any funds received hereunder to each Securityholder, (vii) to execute and deliver any Certificates and execution of such further instruments as may be delivered to Purchaser, (viii) to interpret all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to consent to, execute and deliver any amendment or waiver hereof or thereof on behalf of each such Securityholder, (ix) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Securityholder in connection herewith, (x) to authorize payments to be made with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (xi) to deal with Purchaser and the Escrow and Exchange Agent under this Agreement, the     

  

 Exchange Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement with respect to all
matters arising under each such Agreement, (xii) to take any and all other
actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement, the Exchange Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to engage counsel, accountants or
other agents in connection with the foregoing matters, (xiii) to
obtain reimbursement (whether or not out of the Stockholder Rep Expense Fund)
as provided for herein for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses and other
obligations of, or incurred by, the Stockholder Representative in connection
with this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and (xiv) to take all actions that are either (A) necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (B) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Notices
or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative will constitute
notice to or from each of the Securityholders for all purposes under this
Agreement except where the context otherwise requires.

  

 2. The Stockholder Representative may delegate its authority as Stockholder Representative to any one of the Securityholders for a fixed or indeterminate period of time upon not fewer than 10 Business Days\' prior written notice to the Purchaser in accordance with Section 11.2. Each successor Stockholder Representative has all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Stockholder Representative, and the term "Stockholder Representative" as used in this Agreement includes any successor Stockholder Representative.

 

 3. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative constitutes a decision of all the Securityholders (except where the context otherwise requires) and is final, binding and conclusive upon the Securityholders, and the Purchaser and any Indemnified Party may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders. The Purchaser is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done or omissions by the Purchaser in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative (so long as the Purchaser did not act in a manner constituting fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser is entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon any document delivered by the Stockholder Representative as being genuine and correct and having been duly signed or sent by the Stockholder Representative.

 

 4. The Stockholder Representative will have no Liability to any Person for any act done or omitted under this Agreement as the Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and not in a manner constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Securityholders will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against any Losses the Stockholder Representative may suffer as a result of any such action or omission.

 

 5. The Stockholder Representative will receive no compensation for services as the Stockholder Representative. The Securityholders will reimburse, on a pro rata basis in proportion to their interest in the Merger Consideration, the Stockholder Representative for professional fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other advisors retained by the Stockholder Representative and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the performance of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties under this Agreement. An amount equal to $250,000 (the " _Stockholder Rep Expense Fund_ ") will be deducted from the Merger Consideration and delivered to the Stockholder Representative at the Closing to be held in trust to cover and reimburse the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement, with any balance of the Stockholder Rep Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes to be returned to the Securityholders on a pro rata basis.

     

  

 6. This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Securityholders to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Section 11.1 is coupled with an interest, is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement, is irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any Securityholder or by operation of Law, whether upon the death or incapacity of any Securityholder, or by the occurrence of any other event.

  

11.2 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
must be in writing and are deemed duly delivered when (a) delivered if

11.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except in a written document signed by each party to be
bound by the amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this
Agreement. Any amendment of this Agreement signed by the Stockholder
Representative is binding upon and effective against each Securityholder
regardless of whether or not such Securityholder has in fact signed such
amendment.

 

11.4 _Waiver and Remedies_. The parties may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to
this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party to this Agreement contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any
such extension or waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if
set forth in a written document signed on behalf of the party or
parties against whom the waiver or extension is to be effective. Any such
extension or waiver signed by the Stockholder Representative is binding upon
and effective against each Securityholder regardless of whether or not such
Securityholder has in fact signed the extension or waiver. No extension or
waiver will apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any covenant, agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
written extension or waiver. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the parties,
operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise
of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any
enumeration of a party\'s rights and remedies in this Agreement is not
intended to be exclusive, and a party\'s rights and remedies are intended to
be cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any rights and
remedies authorized in law or in equity.

 

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, or any of them, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.   

11.6 _Assignment and Successors_. This Agreement binds and benefits the
parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, except that the Company may not assign any rights under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. No party may
delegate any performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except that
the Purchaser may at any time delegate the performance of its obligations to
any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser remains
fully responsible for the performance of the delegated obligation. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give
any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement except such rights as may inure to a
successor or permitted assignee under this Section.

 

11.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way
and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid,
illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision.

 

11.8 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The exhibits and schedules to this Agreement
are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement. The
Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections and paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs of Article
3. The listing or inclusion of a copy of a document or other item is not
adequate to disclose an exception to any representation or warranty in this
Agreement unless the representation or warranty relates to the existence
of the document or item itself. The Company Disclosure Schedule will be
subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) any item disclosed in any
particular part of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be
disclosed in any other part of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent
its relevance or appropriateness is reasonably apparent from the context in
which it is presented, and to the extent of any cross-references and the
like; (b) no disclosure of any matter contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedule will create an implication that such matter meets any standard of
materiality other than the applicable standard set forth in this Agreement
(matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, it being understood and agreed that such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature, nor will the inclusion of any item
be construed as implying that any such item is "material" for any purpose);
and (c) headings and introductory language have been inserted on the sections
of the Company Disclosure Schedule for convenience of reference only and will
to no extent have the effect of amending or changing the express description
of the sections as set forth in this Agreement.

 

11.9 _Interpretation_. The language used in this Agreement is the language
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party
or its attorney drafted the provision.

 

11.10 _Governing Law_. Unless any exhibit or schedule specifies a different
choice of law, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and its exhibits and schedules and all of the
transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or controversies
arising therefrom.

 

11.11 _Disputes_. The Purchaser and the Company (or, after the Effective
Time, the Stockholder Representative) agree to use reasonable efforts to
resolve between themselves any dispute they have with respect to the matters
covered hereby, pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or   

 agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, including any
amendments hereof and thereof in the following manner: The parties mutually
desire that friendly collaboration will develop between themselves.
Accordingly, and without limiting any rights hereunder, the parties will try
to resolve in a friendly manner all disagreements and misunderstandings
connected with their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement,
any agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto or any other Ancillary
Agreements.

  

11.12 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California (or, if subject matter jurisdiction in that court is not available,
in the state courts of California located in the county of Santa Clara,
California) over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby or entered into in connection herewith or therewith or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding will be
heard and determined in such courts (and the courts hearing appeals from such
courts). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in
such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH PARTY\'S RIGHTS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THEREWITH OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 

11.13 _Limitation of Liabilities_. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY WHICH IS A
SIGNATORY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY OR OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
LOST PROFITS, OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY
WILL BE ADVISED, WILL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT WILL KNOW OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING; UNLESS, SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO CONSEQUENTIAL OR
SPECIAL (TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DEEMED TO BE CONSEQUENTIAL),
SUCH DAMAGES CONSTITUTE LOSSES WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 9 AND ARE
OWED TO THIRD PARTIES AS PART OF A JUDGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM OF
SUCH THIRD PERSON AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 

11.14 _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the
same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission that includes a copy of the sending party\'s signature is
as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

 

11.15 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each party will bear its respective direct and indirect expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all fees and expenses of its advisors and representatives. If this Agreement
is terminated, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be
subject to any rights of such party arising from any breach of this Agreement
by another party.   

11.16 _Construction_. Any reference in this Agreement to an "Article,"
"Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding Article,
Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the context
indicates otherwise. The table of contents and the headings of Articles and
Sections are provided for convenience only and are not intended to affect the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement should be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances require. The term "including" means "including without
limitation" and is intended by way of example and not limitation. Any
reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor
legislation, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as in
effect at the relevant time. Any reference to a Contract or other document as
of a given date means the Contract or other document as amended, supplemented
and modified from time to time through such date. The terms "herein,"
"hereof," "hereby," "hereunder" and other similar terms refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not only to the particular Article, Section or other
subdivision in which any such terms may be employed. Reference to any
Person will include such Person\'s predecessors. The plural will be deemed to
include the singular and vice versa. Use of "or" is not intended to be
exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise." A defined term has its
defined meaning throughout this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears
before or after the place in this Agreement where it is defined, including in
any Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement. The word
"dollar" and the symbol "$" refer to the lawful currency of the United
States of America.

 

11.17 _Specific Performance, Injunctive Relief_. In addition to and not in
derogation of any other remedy available at law (or in equity) for such
breach, and subject to the express limitations contained in this Agreement,
the Company and the Securityholders will be entitled to specific performance,
injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce their rights under or
prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or future) of the
terms hereof with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by in the event of breach prior to the Effective Time by
the other party. The foregoing sentence will not be construed as a waiver by
the Company or any Securityholder of any right such Person may now have or
hereafter acquire to monetary damages from the other parties.

 

11.18 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. In connection with
any dispute that may arise between the Stockholder Representative (whether in
its capacity as such or as a Securityholder) or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser or the Company or any of their Affiliates, on the
other hand, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser will not, and will not cause the Company to,
seek to have Kirkland and Ellis LLP disqualified from representing
the Stockholder Representative (or any of its Affiliates). [Signature page follows]
