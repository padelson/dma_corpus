 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
March 4, 2015, is by and among AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Oxford Amherst Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), Oxford Amherst LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub 2_ " and, together with Purchaser, the " _Merger Subs_ "), and
Pharmacyclics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All
capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in _Annex A_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement
unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Parent, each of the Merger Subs
and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Purchaser shall commence a tender offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001
par value per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ " or, such
shares, " _Company Shares_ ") for the consideration and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, the Parties wish to effect the acquisition of the
Company by Parent through (a) the merger of Purchaser with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving entity (the " _First Merger_ ")
and (b) immediately following the First Merger, the merger of the Company, as
the surviving entity of the First Merger, with and into Merger Sub 2, with
Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together
with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the First Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and
will be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the
Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the First Merger, each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Offer and the Mergers have been structured to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code when
considered together;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") (i) unanimously determined that the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ "), including the
Offer and the First Merger in connection therewith are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) determined that it
is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained herein and the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers and the other
Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and
(iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors or sole member, as applicable, of Parent and
each of the Merger Subs have approved this Agreement and determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Mergers and the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Offer and the First Merger, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and each of the
Merger Subs and its stockholders or members, as applicable;

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Parents willingness to enter
into this Agreement, concurrently with the entry of the parties into this
Agreement, Robert W. Duggan is entering into a support agreement with Parent
(the " _Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, Mr.
Duggan agrees to tender all Company Shares beneficially owned by him into the
Offer; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Mergers and also
prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Mergers.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE OFFER**

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to _Article IX_, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event more than thirteen (13) business days
thereafter), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase any and all of the Company Shares. In the Offer, each
Company Share accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Offer and in compliance with applicable Law shall be
exchanged for the right to receive, at the election of the holder: (i)
$$261.25 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to (x) $261.25 _divided by_ (y) the Parent Trading
Price (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (iii) $152.25 in cash and a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) $109.00 _divided by_ (y) the
Parent Trading Price (the " _Mixed Consideration_ "), in each case subject to
proration as set forth in _Section 1.1(c)_ and the other provisions of this
_Article I_. The Offer shall be made by means

 



      
 

 



 

of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to
all of the holders of Company Shares and contains the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in _Annex B_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer shall be subject only to:

 



 

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the expiration
of the Offer, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with
the terms of the Offer a number of Company Shares that, together with the
Company Shares then owned by Parent and Purchaser (if any), represents at
least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares (excluding Company
Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been "received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the
depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures); and

 



 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex B_.

 



 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions to
the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions to, the Offer;
_provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to) (i) waive the
Minimum Condition, or any of the conditions set forth in clauses (A), (C),
(D), (E), (F)(1), or (F)(5) of _Annex B_ ( _provided_ , that Parent shall (and
shall cause Purchaser to) waive the condition set forth in (F)(5) of _Annex B_
upon the written request of the Company), and (ii) make any change in the
terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration
to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the consideration in the Offer or the
number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other
than in a manner required by the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)_, (D) imposes
conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex B_ , (E) modifies
the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ , or (F) amends any other term or
condition of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the holders of Company
Shares.

 



 

(c) _Election; Proration; Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other clauses of this _Section 1.1(c)_, each holder of
Company Shares tendered in the Offer shall be entitled to elect (i) the number
of Company Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the right to
receive the Mixed Consideration (a " _Mixed Election_ ", and such shares, the
" _Mixed Election Shares_ "), (ii) the number of Company Shares which such
holder desires to exchange for the right to receive the Cash Consideration (a
" _Cash Election_ ", and such shares, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), and
(iii) the number of Company Shares which such holder desires to exchange for
the right to receive the Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ", and such
shares, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "). Any Cash Election, Stock Election or
Mixed Election shall be referred to herein as an " _Election_ ," and shall be
made on a form mutually agreed by Parent and the Company for that purpose (a "
_Form of Election in Offer_"), included as part of the letter(s) of election
and transmittal accompanying the Offer.

 



 

(ii) Any Election pursuant to the Offer shall have been properly made only if
the depositary of the Offer shall have actually received a properly completed
Form of Election in

 



      
 

 



 

Offer by the expiration date of the Offer. Any Form of Election in Offer may
be revoked or changed by the authorized Person properly submitting such Form
of Election in Offer, by written notice received by the depositary of the
Offer prior to the expiration date of the Offer. In the event a Form of
Election in Offer is revoked prior to the expiration date of the Offer, the
Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in Offer shall become
Mixed Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly
made with respect to any or all of such Company Shares prior to expiration
date of the Offer. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Form of
Election in Offer, the depositary of the Offer shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Form of
Election in Offers, and any good faith decisions of the depositary of the
Offer regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent,
the Company or the depositary of the Offer shall be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in a Form of Election in Offer.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 1.1(c)(iv)_, _Section 1.1(c)(v)_ and _Section
1.1(c)(vi)_, the Cash Elections and the Stock Elections shall be subject to
proration in the following circumstances:

 



 

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in
the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Cash Consideration shall
equal (x) 58.3% of the sum of (A) the aggregate number of Company Shares
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election
Shares and No Election Shares) _plus_ (B) all Dissenting Shares (or Company
Shares that were Dissenting Shares as of the Acceptance Time), _minus_ (y) all
Dissenting Shares (or Company Shares that were Dissenting Shares as of the
Acceptance Time) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Offer_ ").

 



 

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, such Cash
Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: For each such Cash
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Cash
Election Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer multiplied by
(B) the Offer Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company
Share. The " _Offer Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged for the right
to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this _Section
1.1(c)(iii)(2)_ shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 



 

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in
the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Stock Consideration shall
equal 41.7 % of the sum of (A) the aggregate number of Company Shares tendered
in the Offer (and were not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election Shares
and No Election Shares) plus (B) all

 



      
 

 



 

Dissenting Shares (or Company Shares that were Dissenting Shares as of the
Acceptance Time) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Offer_ ").

 



 

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer, such Stock
Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: For each such Stock
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Stock
Election Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer multiplied by
(B) the Offer Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company
Share. The " _Offer Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged for the
right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with this _Section
1.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.

 



 

(iv) All prorations resulting from either _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2)_ or
_Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each
holder of Company Shares who tenders Cash Election Shares or Stock Election
Shares, as applicable, bears its proportionate share of the proration, based
on a percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such holder
of Company Shares bears to all Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as applicable, tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by all
holders of Company Shares.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2)_ and _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_, but subject
to _Section 1.1(c)(vi)_, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares, No
Election Shares and Mixed Election Shares tendered in the Offer (and not
validly withdrawn) shall be exchanged for the right to receive Stock
Consideration to the extent necessary to secure the tax opinions contemplated
by clause (F)(5) of _Annex B_ as a condition to the Offer, with such Company
Shares to be selected by a pro rata selection process by the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section 1.1(c)(v)_, in no event shall the total number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Offer and the Merger and upon
exercise or conversion of all convertible securities assumed by Parent in the
Merger constitute such a percentage of the total number of outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock the issuance of which would require any stockholder
action under the NYSE Rule.

 



 

(vii) Each Company Share tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) but
which is not the subject of a valid Election (a " _No Election Share_ ")
received prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be deemed to be tendered
to a Mixed Election. In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares or No
Election Shares be subject to proration pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2)_
or _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_, but such shares may be subject to proration
pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)(v)_ and _Section 1.1(c)(vi)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of Company Shares who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all Company Shares tendered in
the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such holder) will be paid an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading Price.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to the Offer_. The Mixed Consideration, Cash Consideration,
the Stock Consideration, the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, the Offer Cash
Proration Factor, the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and the Offer Stock
Proration Factor shall each be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, Company Shares that are tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

(e) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 



 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date that

Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at
the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, without the consent of the Company:

 



 

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer, or to the extent necessary to resolve any comments of
the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents; and

 



 

(B) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum
Condition) have not been satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) business
days each in order to further seek to satisfy the Offer Conditions (including
the Minimum Condition);

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that any such extension shall not be deemed to impair,
limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_ without the prior written consent
of the Company.

 



 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day)
after such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(v) Nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.

 



 

(f) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that are
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer promptly (within the meaning
of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration
of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_)
(such time, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a
timely basis the funds and shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to pay for
any Company Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer; _provided, however,_ that without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares
if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the number of Company
Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The consideration in the
Offer payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash or
shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, subject to reduction for any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof. The Company shall
register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of
the Company Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser effective immediately
after the Acceptance Time.

the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for

any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which Parent and Purchaser
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any reasonable comments
made by the Company and its counsel) and to participate in any scheduled
discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments. Parent
shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **TREATMENT OF SECURITIES**

 



 

Section 3.1. _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or holders of any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to
_Section 1.1(a)_ and any applicable withholding Tax, each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other
than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, (i) the
Mixed Consideration, (ii) the Cash Consideration or (iii) the Stock
Consideration (in case, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in each case subject
to proration as set forth in _Section 3.1(e)_ and the other provisions of
this _Article III_. From and after the First Effective Time, all such Company
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable portion of Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Company Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_, including the right to
receive, pursuant to _Section 3.6_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such Company Shares have been
converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share
Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 3.2(f)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, all
Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent, the Merger Subs or by any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ").

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the First Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
(the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the First Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the First Effective Time,
all certificates representing Purchaser Shares shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or
holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of Merger Sub
2, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a
membership interest of the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common
stock of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any
consideration being payable therefor.

 



 

(e) _Election; Proration_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other clauses of this _Section 3.1(e)_, each holder of
Company Shares as of immediately prior to the consummation of the First Merger
(other than Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares) shall be entitled to elect
(i) a number of Cash Election Shares, (ii) a number of Stock Election Shares,
and (iii) a number of Mixed Election Shares. Any Cash Election, Stock Election
or Mixed Election shall be made on a form mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company prior to the Acceptance Time for that purpose (a " _Form of Election
in Merger_"), which shall be mailed to such holders of Company Shares promptly
after the Closing Date (such date, the " _Mailing Date_ "). The deadline for
submitting an effective, properly completed Form of Election in Merger to the
Exchange Agent shall be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th day
following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Parties may
mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ").

 



 

(ii) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Form of Election in Merger
by the Election Deadline. Any Form of Election in Merger may be revoked or
changed by the authorized Person properly submitting such Form of Election in
Merger, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline. In the event a Form of Election in Merger is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in
Merger shall become Mixed Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of such Company Shares
prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Form of Election in Merger, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Form of
Election in Merger, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Form of Election in Merger.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section_ ___3.1(e)(iv_ ), _Section 3.1(e)(v)_ and _Section
3.1(e)(vi)_ , the Cash Election Shares and Stock Election Shares eligible to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be subject to
proration in the following circumstances:

 



 

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to receive
the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall equal 58.3% of the
aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (excluding Mixed Election Shares and the No
Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Merger_ ").

 



 

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares in
Merger, such Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: For each
such Cash Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of
Cash Election Shares _multiplied by_ (B) the Merger Cash Proration Factor,
rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger Cash Proration
Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum
Cash Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be the aggregate
number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The Cash Election Shares that were not
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 3.1(e)(iii)(2)_ shall be converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration.

 



 

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to receive
the Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall equal 41.7% of the
aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (excluding Mixed Election Shares and the No
Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Merger_ ").

 



 

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares
in Merger, such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: For
each such Stock Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total
number of Stock Election Shares _multiplied by_ (B) the Merger Stock Proration
Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger Stock
Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the
Maximum Stock Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The Stock Election Shares that
were not converted

 



      
 

 



 

into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 3.1(e)(iii)(4)_ shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration.

 



 

(iv) All prorations resulting from either _Section 3.1(c)(iii)(2)_ or
_Section 3.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each
holder of Company Shares bears its proportionate share of the proration, based
on a percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, elected by such holder of Company Shares bears to all Cash
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as applicable, elected by holders of
Company Shares in the First Merger.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 3.1(e)(vi)_, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares
and No Election Shares and Mixed Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be converted into the right
to receive Stock Consideration to the same extent as any comparable proration
in the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)(v)_.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section 3.1(e)(v)_, in no event shall the total number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Offer and issuable pursuant to
the Merger and upon exercise or conversion of all convertible securities
assumed by Parent in the Merger constitute such a percentage of the total
number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock the issuance of which
would require any stockholder action under the NYSE Rule.

 



 

(f) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration, Maximum
Cash Shares in Merger, and Merger Cash Proration Factor and Merger Stock
Proration Factor shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of Company Shares or Parent Common Stock outstanding
after the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the
Companys stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Form of
Election in Merger and Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no
rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or immediately after
the First Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding
any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section
3.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
amounts,

 



      
 

 



 

together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
Company Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay
the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share
Consideration and any dividends under _Section 3.2(f)_, Parent shall, or
shall cause Parent or Purchaser to, promptly deposit additional funds with the
Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make,
and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Company on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the First Effective
Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause the Exchange
Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the First
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent
or the Surviving Company, together with such letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_, any Fractional Share Consideration that

 



      
 

 



 

such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.6_, and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ for each Company Share formerly represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for
collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5)
business days following the later to occur of (x) the Election Deadline and
the determination of pro ration pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ or (y) the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax either
has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Article III_, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.2(f)_, without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the First Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after
the First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the First Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Company and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the applicable Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any
dividends or other

 



      
 

 



 

distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and compliance with the procedures in _Section 3.2(b)_, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_
hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2(f)_.

 



 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Dissenter s Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not tendered
into the Offer and properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred
to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to
payment of such consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if, after the First
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Company
Shares shall be

 



      
 

 



 

treated as if they had been converted as of the First Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may
be.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) As of the First Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash amount(s) equal to the
product of: (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Cash
Consideration over (y) the exercise price per Company Share of such Company
Stock Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). With respect to the portion of
the Option Cash Payment relating to any Vested Company Stock Option, such
Option Cash Payment shall be payable (without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes) in a lump sum promptly following the Closing Date. With
respect to the portion of the Option Cash Payment relating to any Unvested
Company Stock Option, the Option Cash Payment shall be payable (without
interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) through December 31 of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the " _Delayed Payment Date_
") at the same rate as the corresponding Unvested Company Stock Option would
have vested under the vesting terms in place immediately prior to the First
Effective Time had such Unvested Company Stock Option not been cancelled under
this Agreement with any remaining unpaid Option Cash Payment as of the Delayed
Payment Date payable (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes)
in a lump sum on or before the Delayed Payment Date, in all cases subject to
the holder continuing to provide services to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (and further subject to any vesting acceleration
provided for in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or
other agreement, plan, policy, or arrangement applicable to such Company Stock
Option or applicable to such Company Stock Options by reason of this Agreement
or the Transactions). With respect to any Company Stock Option with
performance-based vesting conditions that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the performance goals will be
deemed achieved at target levels and such Company Stock Option will be vested
as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time to the same extent such
Company Stock Option would have been had the performance goals been achieved
at target levels following the end of the performance period(s) under the
vesting schedule applicable to such Company Stock Option in place immediately
prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As of the First Effective Time, each Company RSU shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash amount(s) equal to the product of:
(i) the total number of

 



      
 

 



 

Company RSUs _multiplied by_ (ii) the Cash Consideration (the " _RSU Cash
Payment_ "). With respect to the portion of the RSU Cash Payment relating to
any Vested Company RSU, such RSU Cash Payment shall be payable (without
interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) in a lump sum promptly
following the Closing Date. With respect to the portion of the RSU Cash
Payment relating to any Unvested Company RSU, the RSU Cash Payment shall be
payable (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) through the
Delayed Payment Date at the same rate as the corresponding Unvested Company
RSU would have vested under the vesting terms in place immediately prior to
the First Effective Time had such Unvested Company RSU not been cancelled
under this Agreement with any remaining unpaid RSU Cash Payment payable
(without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) in a lump sum on or
before the Delayed Payment Date, in all cases subject to the holder continuing
to provide services to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date (and further subject to any vesting acceleration provided for in the
applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or other agreement,
plan, policy, or arrangement applicable to such Company RSUs, or applicable to
such Company RSUs by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). With
respect to any Company RSU with performance-based vesting conditions that
remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the
performance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels and such Company
RSU will be vested as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time to the
same extent such Company RSU would have been had the performance goals been
achieved at target levels following the end of the performance period(s) under
the vesting schedule applicable to such Company RSU in place immediately prior
to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as
are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated
by this _Section 3.4_.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time (i) each outstanding offering period then in
progress (each, an " _Offering Period_ ") under the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall terminate, (ii) each ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Company
Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such time, and the
funds, if any, that remain in the participants accounts after such purchase
shall be returned to the participants and (iii) the ESPP shall terminate. No
participant may elect to participate in the ESPP after the date of this
Agreement, participants may not increase their payroll deduction percentages
or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and
no new offering period under the ESPP shall commence under the ESPP following
the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
pass resolutions as are necessary for the treatment of the purchase rights
under the ESPP and the termination of the ESPP as contemplated by this
_Section 3.4_.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Withholding_. Parent, the Merger Subs, the First Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any
applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to

 



      
 

 



 

the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.6. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the First
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading
Price.

non-public information, documents and materials relating to such Acquisition
Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or assets heretofore

and the Companys Representatives may in any event inform a Person that has
made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.3(a)_
which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i)
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal, and in each case that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then in either event the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any proposals or
inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would
reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
indicate the

 



      
 

 



 

identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request,
and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the
nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request,
including copies of all written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements received by the Company. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material
terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms)

Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of
any information requested of the Company with respect thereto. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning
the Company provided to any other Person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event (other than for an Acquisition Proposal) if the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) make a
Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into an definitive agreement
in connection with an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, which the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal if the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would
obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such
three (3) business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes the
determination described under _Section 6.3(d)(i),_ or (ii) under _Section
6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors
intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and conditions
of the Acquisition Proposal, and during such three (3) business day period,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good
faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and at the end of such three (3) business day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination described under
_Section 6.3(d)(ii)_. With respect to _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any
changes to the financial or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal
for which notice was previously given by the Company pursuant to _Section _

 



      
 

 



 

 _6.3(e)(ii)_ (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of
consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of the
Superior Proposal), such change shall require the Company to comply again with
_Section 6.3(e)(ii)_ (with references to three (3) business days to be
replaced by two (2) business days) prior to making the determination under
_Section 6.3(d)(ii)_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer, or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors has
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 6.3(f)_
shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_ or _Section
6.3(e)_.

party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party
to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in
violation of such consent requirement), (B) the disclosure of which would
violate any Law or duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or
duty) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-
client,

 



      
 

 



 

attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of the Company and
Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the requests for

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers or other Transactions, or from any Person

with the Offer, the Mergers or the other Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent
could be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent, (ii) of any
legal proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against,
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Offer,
the Mergers or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ or give
rise to any right to terminate under _Article IX_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use

best efforts to take all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders

 



      
 

 



 

and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
Party agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten (10) business days after the
execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed between

party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and

to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any
other Governmental Entity or other Person _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials required to be provided pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) may be
redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company
or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

consummate any debt or equity capital markets transaction comprising a part of
the Financing, and (II) such other financial and other information relating to

Act or the Exchange Act, and to provide any "comfort letters" necessary and
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any debt or equity capital
markets transaction comprising a part of the Financing, in each case, on
customary terms and consistent with their customary practice).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.3(a)_ or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in the foregoing _Section 7.3(a)_
will require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to (A) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Acceptance Time for which it has not received prior
reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (B)
enter into any definitive agreement prior to the Acceptance Time (other than
delivery of customary authorization and representation letters in connection
with the Financing), (C) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the
Acceptance Time, (D) take any action that, in the good faith determination of
the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the Company and

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Subsidiaries, (E) provide any information the disclosure of which
is prohibited or restricted under applicable Law or that, in the reasonable
good faith determination of the Company, is legally privileged, or (F) take

Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument (other than customary authorization and representation letters)
relating to the Financing will be effective until the Acceptance Time, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any
action pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Acceptance Time or
that must be effective prior to the Acceptance Time (other than customary
authorization and representation letters). Nothing in this Agreement will
require (A) any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_ or any other provision of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative, or (B) the Company Board of Directors to approve any financing
or Contracts related thereto prior to the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(c) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be

that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any financing

Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such information is furnished by Parent subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings in connection with the Financing.

 



 

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
but excluding the costs of the Companys preparation of its annual and
quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by _Section 7.3(a)_, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to (a) any information provided in writing by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for use in connection with the
Financing or (b) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct by any such persons.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates or Representatives,
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Offer, the Mergers or this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market to issue or cause the

 



      
 

 



 

publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Offer, the Mergers or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required by
this _Section 7.4_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in
connection with the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal or a
Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Parties shall not be required by this _Section 7.4_ to provide any
such review or comment to the other Party to the event of any dispute between
the Parties relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , each Party
and their respective affiliates or Representatives may make statements that
are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this

Section 7.5. _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the First Effective Time,
Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing
Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) or in any agreement shall survive the First Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving Company on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of
which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 7.5_, the provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall continue in
effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims,
actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 



 

(b) For six years after the First Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing
Documents and the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii)
any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any
Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such
provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified
Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at
or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer, the Mergers or any of the other Transactions).

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years from the First Effective Time, the
Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the First
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the
Companys existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable
is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company may prior to the First Effective Time substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.5_. The rights and obligations under this _Section 7.5_
shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Mergers and shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Mergers, the Support
Agreement or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Offer, the Mergers, the Support Agreement and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Mergers, the Support
Agreement and the other Transactions. No Change of Recommendation shall change
the approval of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be
applicable to the Offer, the Mergers, the Support Agreement or any of the
other Transactions.

 



 

Section 7.7. _Obligations of Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause each of the Merger Subs, the First Surviving Corporation
and the Surviving Company to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Mergers, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.8. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) Subject to this _Section 7.8_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement or as subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of
such Company Benefit Plans. Effective as of the First Effective Time and for a
period of no less than two (2) years thereafter, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each employee of the Company
and/or any Company Subsidiary who continues to be employed by the Parent or
the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_
"), (i) cash compensation opportunities (including, without limitation, cash
incentive compensation opportunities, but excluding any equity-based
compensation), that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the cash
compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are,
in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Effective
as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide, that periods of employment with the
Company (including any current or former affiliate of the Company or any
predecessor of the Company) shall, to the extent recognized under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan, be taken into account for all purposes
under all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of
Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or
other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement
plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of
determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan,
eligibility for retirement under an equity-based compensation plan,
eligibility for any retiree health plan or as would result in a duplication of
benefits).

 



 

(b) Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements
or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect
to the Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits
plan of Parent or any affiliate of Parent (except to the extent applicable
under Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the First Effective Time),
(ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to
such Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability
requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Company
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and (iii) credit
each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other
co-payments paid by such employee

 



       
 

 



 

under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in
which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which
any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she
has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any corresponding health benefit
plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year. The Mergers shall not
affect any Continuing Employees accrual of, or right to use, in accordance
with Company policy as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued but unused
by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(c) If, at least ten (10) business days prior to the First Effective Time,
Parent provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to
terminate its 401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k)
plans effective as of the day immediately preceding the First Effective Time
(the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that Parent requests that
such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution
of the Companys Board of Directors.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause or shall prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate
of Parent from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan (including
any Company Benefit Plan) to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan, employee benefit plan of any of the Merger Subs, or other
employee benefit plan, or (ii) create any third party rights or remedies
(including any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever or any right under an employee benefit plan that such person would
not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan without
regard to this Agreement) in any current or former service provider of the
Company or its affiliates (or any legal representatives, beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

 



 

Section 7.9. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity
securities pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the
other Party prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that
Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective directors relating to the Offer, the Mergers, this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, and shall keep the other party informed on a prompt and

 



      
 

 



 

timely basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of Parent and
its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after
the First Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates. In the event
of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of
this _Section 7.10_ and _Section 6.1_ or _Section 7.2_ , the provisions of
this _Section 7.10_ shall control.

 



 

Section 7.11. _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the
First Effective Time, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not
be effective until after the First Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.12. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and effective upon the First Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.13. _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, including by executing and delivering customary tax representation
letters to the Companys and/or Parents counsel, as applicable, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, in connection with (i) any
tax opinion or description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Offer and the Mergers contained or set forth in the Form S-4 or (ii) the tax
opinions required by the conditions to the offer set forth in clauses
(F)(5)(i) and (F)(5)(ii) of _Annex B_. None of the Parties shall (and each of
the Parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action,
or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the
Offer and the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties
intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall
report, for federal income tax purposes, the Offer and the Mergers, taken
together as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 



 

Section 7.14. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First

have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are
to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Shares
and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (A) at a
meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt resolutions
approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under

 



      
 

 



 

the Exchange Act (1) each Arrangement presented to the Company Compensation

Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 10.3_ through _Section 10.12_ shall survive such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Section 9.2(c)_ , nothing herein
shall relieve any Party from liability for a Willful Breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination (which the Parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and may include
the benefit of the bargain lost by (x) the Company or its stockholders (taking
into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to
such stockholders under this Agreement and the time value of money), which

applicable).

 



 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition
prior to such termination, (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the date of such termination, and (C) an Acquisition Proposal is

 



      
 

 



 

consummated within twelve (12) months of such termination or a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into within
twelve (12) months of such termination within two (2) business days after the
date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated the Company shall pay a fee
of $680,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of
this _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ , the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Annex A_ , except that all references to
"20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ , within three
(3) business days after such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

 



 

(iii) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i) or (ii), such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In
no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Merger Subs in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions. In addition, if the Company fails to pay in a timely
manner any amount due pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ , then (i) the Company
shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and
fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including
in connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and
(ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amount payable pursuant
to _Section 9.2(b)_ from and including the date payment of such amount was due
to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ and upon
such payment pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ , none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions.

entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order

Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 



 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 10.12_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.12_ (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). Each Party agrees that

Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this _Section

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Company
or its affiliates (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries)) be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any of the Financing Sources, nor shall
the Parent or its affiliates have any obligation to any Party to enforce any
commitments, or other agreement, by any of the Financing Sources in respect of
financing the Transactions.

Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the

except, in the case of this clause (c), where any failures of any such

not have received an opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to the Company (" _WSGR_ "), dated as of the date of the
