ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

This ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to
time in accordance with the terms hereof, this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of April 19, 2018 by and among REALPAGE, INC., a Delaware
corporation publicly listed on Nasdaq ("Buyer"), NovelPay LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Company"), each of the holders of outstanding
membership units of the Company except for ClickPay Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("TopCo") (as set forth on Schedule I hereto, each, a "Company
Seller" and, collectively, the "Company Sellers"), and NP Representative, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (solely in its capacity as the "Sellers'
Representative"). Buyer, the Company, the Company Sellers, and the Sellers'
Representative are sometimes referred to individually as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties".

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company Sellers and TopCo own, in the aggregate, all of the
issued and outstanding limited liability company units of the Company (the
"Company Units");

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from the Company Sellers, and the Company
Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, at the Closing (as defined below) the Company
Units set forth on Schedule I, which Company Units are owned by the Company
Sellers and along with the Retained Units (as defined on Exhibit A) represent
all of the Company Units owned by the Company Sellers upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (such purchase, the
"Company Purchase");

WHEREAS, simultaneous herewith, Buyer and two subsidiaries of Buyer, RP Newco
XXIII Inc., a Delaware corporation, and RP Newco XXIV Inc., a Delaware
corporation, are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with TopCo (the
"TopCo Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Buyer will acquire all of the
shares of capital stock of TopCo;

WHEREAS, TSL1, Agabs and Horowitz (collectively, the "Retained Unitholders")
will sell certain of their Company Units at Closing, but will also retain the
number and type of Company Units that are designated as "Retained Units"
herein and such Retained Units are subject to put rights and call rights, as
set forth in Section 8.15 hereof; and

WHEREAS, the board of managers of the Company has approved this Agreement,
which contemplates, among other things, the Company Purchase, in accordance
the Delaware LLC Act and in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

AGREEMENT

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises herein
made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants
herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

Article I 
DEFINED TERMS

1.1 Definitions. Unless otherwise specified, all capitalized terms used in
this Agreement have the meanings set forth on Exhibit A.

ARTICLE II 
THE COMPANY PURCHASE; THE CLOSING

2.1 The Company Purchase. At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware LLC Act, the Parties
hereby agree, for the consideration specified in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5
hereof, that each of the Company Sellers shall sell, transfer and deliver to
Buyer, free and clear of all Liens, and Buyer shall purchase from such Company
Seller, the number and type of the Company Units set forth 

opposite such Company Seller's name on Schedule I (collectively, the "Closing
Units"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Units held by TopCo and the
Retained Units shall not be transferred hereunder at Closing and shall remain
issued and outstanding subject to the terms of that certain Fourth Amended and
Restated Operating Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2016, by and among the
Company, TopCo, and other parties thereto, (the "AandR Operating Agreement").
The AandR Operating Agreement shall be amended and restated immediately
following the Closing as set forth in Exhibit B hereto (the "Fifth AandR
Operating Agreement").

2.2 The Closing. The closing of the sale of the Closing Units (the "Closing")
will take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures at 10:00
a.m. Central Time on the date hereof (the "Closing Date"), unless the Parties
otherwise agree in writing. For tax and accounting purposes, the Closing shall
be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. Dallas time on the Closing Date
(the "Effective Time").

2.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Closing Units (the "Closing
Unit Purchase Price") shall be calculated and equal the amount set forth below
(the "Adjusted Equity Value"):

(a) an amount equal to (i) the First Component of Baseline Enterprise Value,
multiplied by (ii) 49.416%, plus

(b) an amount equal to (i) the Final Component of Baseline Enterprise Value,
multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Closing Percentage, plus

(c) an amount equal to (i) all Company Cash as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Closing Company Cash"), multiplied by (ii) the Applicable
Closing Percentage, minus

(d) an amount equal to (i) any Net Working Capital Adjustment as of
immediately prior to the Closing, multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Closing
Percentage, minus

(e) an amount equal to (i) the Closing Net Debt Amount as of immediately prior
to the Closing, multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Closing Percentage, minus

(f) an amount equal to (i) the Transaction Expenses not satisfied prior to
Closing, multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Closing Percentage.

2.4 Closing Deliveries and Payments. The obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Closing shall be subject to:

(a) Buyer Closing Deliveries. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver

(b) Company and Company Sellers' Closing Deliveries. At or prior to the
Closing, the Company and the Company Sellers, as applicable, shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer:

(i) with respect to all the Closing Units to be purchased by Buyer, where

delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by
the Company or the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein, as set forth on Schedule 2.4(b)(iii), in form and substance
satisfactory to Buyer;

(iv) written resignations from each manager and officer of the Company, which

(c) Payments of Closing Cash Consideration and Issuances of Buyer Common
Stock. At the Closing (or as otherwise provided below), Buyer shall on behalf

following:

account of such Company Seller designated in writing by the Sellers'
Representative to Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the cash portion of such Company Seller's Individual Closing
Payment Amount;

(ii) to the Company Sellers, an aggregate amount of shares of Buyer Common
Stock equal to the 1st Anniversary Holdback Shares, with Buyer issuing a stock
certificate in such Company Seller's name evidencing shares of Buyer Common

Anniversary Holdback Shares, which shares shall be retained by Buyer pursuant
to Section 2.6 hereof;

(iii) at the direction of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable vendor or the Company, as the case may be,
such amounts in cash as are necessary to pay in full the Transaction Expenses

(iv) to the Sellers' Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund Amount.

2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Statement. The
Company has prepared in good faith and provided to Buyer no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a written certificate signed by
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the estimated balance
sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), which Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
shall identify the amounts of restricted cash appearing as customer deposits
on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the "Restricted Cash Customer
Deposits"), together with a written statement (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith estimates of the
Company's Net Working Capital, Closing Net Debt Amount, Closing Company Cash
and any Transaction Expenses not satisfied prior to the Closing (the
"Adjustable Financial Amounts"), each as derived from the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and such good faith
estimate of each Adjustable Financial Amount contained in the Estimated
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Estimated
Closing Statement, which shall be in substantially the form of Schedule I
attached hereto, shall also include the identity of each Person that is to be
paid any Transaction Expenses; the amount owed or to be owed to each such
Person; and the bank account and wire transfer information for each such
Person.

(b) Closing Payment. The Adjusted Equity Value used for the purposes of
determining the amounts payable at Closing under Section 2.4(c) shall be
calculated using the same estimates of the Adjustable Financial Amounts set
forth in the final Estimated Closing Statement.

(c) Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Closing Statement.
As promptly as possible and in any event within one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, and will provide to the Sellers' Representative, a balance sheet of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Proposed
Final Closing Balance Sheet"), including Buyer's calculation of the Restricted
Cash Customer Deposits as of the Closing, together with a written statement
(the "Proposed Final Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail
its proposed final determination of the Adjustable Financial Amounts. The
Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(d) Dispute Notice. The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Final Closing Statement (and the proposed final determinations of the
Adjustable Financial Amounts reflected thereon) will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties unless Sellers' Representative provides a written
notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer no later than the thirtieth (30th) day
after the delivery to the Sellers' Representative of the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement (the "Proposed
Final Closing Statement Response Period"). Any Dispute Notice must set forth
in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet
or the Proposed Final Closing Statement which Sellers' Representative believes
is incorrect and the correct amount of such item and (ii) Sellers'
Representative's alternative calculation of any Adjustable Financial Amount,
as applicable. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in the Dispute
Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties on such thirtieth
(30th) day of the Proposed Final Closing Statement Response Period. During the
Proposed Final Closing Statement Response Period, Sellers' Representative and
its duly authorized advisors and representatives shall be permitted to review
any working papers, trial balances and similar materials to the extent
reasonably necessary for Sellers' Representative and its duly authorized
advisors and representatives to review the Proposed Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement.

(e) Resolution of Disputes. Buyer and Sellers' Representative will attempt to
promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good faith.
Beginning thirty (30) days after delivery of any Dispute Notice pursuant to
Section 2.5(d), either Buyer or Sellers' Representative may provide written
notice to the other (the "Dispute Submission Notice") that it elects to submit
the disputed items to KPMG US LLP or another firm of regional standing



mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (the "Accounting
Firm"). The Accounting Firm will promptly and in accordance with such
procedures as it deems fair and equitable (subject to the terms of this
Agreement), provided that each party shall be afforded an opportunity to
submit a written statement in favor of its position and to advocate for its
position orally before the Accounting Firm, review only those unresolved items
and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice,
which resolution shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Accounting Firm will promptly resolve the items in dispute, provided that
no calculation of any Adjustable Financial Amount in dispute shall be either
greater than the greater of, or lesser than the lesser of, (i) the calculation
of such Adjustable Financial Amount set forth on the Dispute Notice (as may be
adjusted and as submitted by Sellers' Representative to the Accounting Firm at
the outset of the dispute resolution process with a copy to Buyer) and (ii)
Buyer's calculation of such Adjustable Financial Amount as set forth on the
Proposed Final Closing Statement (as may be adjusted and as submitted by Buyer
to the Accounting Firm at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a
copy to the Sellers' Representative). In any such case, the Accounting Firm
shall render a written decision with respect to such disputed matter,
including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for its decision. The
party whose position with respect to the matter in dispute is furthermost from
the Accounting Firm's final determination shall pay all of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm. The decision of the Accounting Firm with
respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and
the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. As used herein, the Proposed Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect any
changes agreed to by the parties and the decision of the Accounting Firm, in
each case, pursuant to this Section 2.5(e), are referred to herein as the
"Final Closing Balance Sheet" and the "Final Closing Statement", respectively.
Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to reasonably cooperate with the
Accounting Firm (including by executing a customary engagement letter
reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any
such dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Accounting
Firm's engagement.



(f) Closing Payment Adjustment. If any Adjustable Financial Amount as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement differs from the estimated amounts
thereof set forth in the Estimated Closing Statements, the Adjusted Equity
Value shall be recalculated and using such final figures in lieu of such
estimated figures:

(i) If the Adjusted Equity Value calculated as set forth in Section 2.3 using
the Adjustable Financial Amounts as set forth in the Final Closing Statement
is greater than or equal to the Adjusted Equity Value calculated pursuant to
Section 2.5(b) (such difference a "Purchase Price Underpayment"), then Buyer
shall be required to pay the Company Sellers, within five (5) Business Days
following the final determination of the Adjusted Equity Value, an amount in
cash equal to such Purchase Price Underpayment. Such amount shall be allocated
among the Company Sellers based on their respective Adjustment Pro Rata
Portion and paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
of such Company Seller designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative to
Buyer; and

(ii) If the Adjusted Equity Value calculated as set forth in Section 2.3 using
the Adjustable Financial Amounts as set forth in the Final Closing Statement
is less than the Adjusted Equity Value calculated pursuant to Section 2.5(b)
(such difference, a "Purchase Price Overpayment"), then Buyer shall be paid
such Purchase Price Overpayment, which shall be satisfied (A) first, from the
Holdback Consideration (initially from the 1st Anniversary Holdback Shares and
then, to the extent such Purchase Price Overpayment is greater than the 1st
Anniversary Holdback Shares Amount available, from the 2nd Anniversary
Holdback Shares), and (B) second, if and to the extent the Purchase Price
Overpayment is greater than the Holdback Consideration available, from each
Company Seller, severally, in accordance with each such Company Seller's
respective Adjustment Pro Rata Portion; provided, however, that if the
Purchase Price Overpayment is any amount greater than $1,000,000, then Buyer
may recover the Purchase Price Overpayment directly from each Company Seller,
severally, in accordance with each such Company Seller's respective Adjustment
Pro Rata Portion, without any requirement to first recover any amounts of the
Purchase Price Overpayment from the Holdback Consideration. Any amounts
directly paid to Buyer by a Company Seller pursuant to this Section 2.5(f)(ii)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Buyer.

2.6 Holdback. At the Closing, Buyer shall retain the 1st Anniversary Holdback
Shares and 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares from the Purchase Price that is
payable to the Company Sellers which shall be allocated



to those Closing Units of the Company Sellers that are set forth on the
Payment Spreadsheet (as defined in Section 6.5(a)), which Holdback
Consideration will constitute security for the satisfaction of the Company
Sellers' indemnity and Purchase Price Overpayment obligations under this
Agreement (the "Company Seller Obligations"). Buyer shall retain and shall
have the right to subtract from the Holdback Consideration (initially from the
1st Anniversary Holdback Shares until such shares are exhausted and then from
the 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares) any Buyer Indemnified Losses for which a
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article
VII. Buyer shall pay the balance of the Holdback Consideration to the Company
Sellers (or their respective written designee(s)) as follows:

(a) Initial Release Date. Within fifteen (15) days after the date that is one
day following the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (such date, the

of shares of Buyer Common Stock, determined by dividing such cash amount by
the Issue Price as of the Closing Date, to cover a reasonable estimate of
Buyer Indemnified Losses to be incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, as

Sellers hereby irrevocably authorize Buyer to submit to its transfer agent for
cancellation the stock certificates representing the 1st Anniversary Holdback

Company Seller's name evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock representing
such Company Seller's Holdback Pro Rata Portion of the 2nd Anniversary
Holdback Shares and which 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares shall be retained by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6(b). Within fifteen (15) days after the date
that is one day following the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date (such
date, the "Second Release Date"), Buyer shall issue to the Company Sellers a
number of shares of fully paid, nonassessable Buyer Common Stock in an amount
equal to (A) the 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares, minus (B) the amount of

Shares retained by Buyer in order to permit the reductions to the 2nd
Anniversary Holdback Shares contemplated by this Section 2.6(b) and issue new
stock certificates representing the 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares, if any,
following such reductions.



(c) Resolution of Existing Claims. If after the Initial Release Date or Second
Release Date, any claims for indemnity are resolved in favor of the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Company Sellers) by mutual agreement or
otherwise, or if upon resolution of a claim for indemnity in accordance with
the provisions hereof, the amount withheld exceeds the amount ultimately
payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, Buyer shall
release to the Company Sellers a number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of
Buyer Common Stock in an amount equal to the excess amount withheld, with such
amount of shares being determined by dividing such excess amount withheld by
the Issue Price as of the Closing Date, with respect to the 1st Anniversary
Holdback Shares, or of the Initial Release Date, with respect to the 2nd
Anniversary Holdback Shares.

(d) Allocation of Holdback Consideration Among Company Sellers. All shares of
Buyer Common Stock that are released to the Company Sellers on the Initial
Release Date, the Second Release Date or upon resolution of existing claims
shall constitute Purchase Price and shall be distributed to the Company
Sellers based on their respective Holdback Pro Rata Portion.

entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement any Taxes or other amounts required under the
Code or any Applicable Laws to be deducted and withheld, and, to the extent
that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that such amounts are not so
deducted and withheld, such Person shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates
and any other applicable withholding agent for any such amounts imposed by a
Governmental Entity, together with any related costs, expenses or damages.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any compensatory
amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding that are payable pursuant
to or as contemplated by this Agreement, including any such amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.4, and including any payments of transaction or similar
bonuses, shall be payable through the Company (or other applicable entity) in

marketable title to such Company Units, free and clear of all Liens. Such

hereby and thereby, Buyer will be the record and beneficial owner of such
Company Seller's Company Units, and have good and marketable title thereto,
free and clear of all Liens except for such Liens as are imposed by Buyer.
Except pursuant to this Agreement, there is no contractual obligation pursuant
to which such Company Seller has, directly or indirectly, granted any option,
warrant or other right to any Person other than the Company to acquire any
membership interest in the Company. Except as disclosed on Section 3.2(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, such Company Seller is not a party to, and the

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.7 No Other Payments. The payments contemplated by this Agreement to be made
to such Company Seller in respect of the Company Units held thereby as of
immediately prior to the Closing are the sole amounts owed and payable to such
Company Seller with respect to such Company Units, and no such Company Seller
has any rights or claims with respect to any payments with respect thereto
other than the payments contemplated by this Agreement, in the amounts and
subject to the terms set forth herein.

4.8 No Other Agreements to Sell Equity Interests. Neither such Company Seller
nor any of its officers, directors, members, representatives or Affiliates
have any commitment or legal obligation, absolute or contingent, to any other
Person or firm other than Buyer to sell, assign, transfer or effect a sale of
any of such Company Seller's Company Units, or to enter into any agreement
with respect to any of the foregoing. Such Company Seller is not currently
engaged in discussions or negotiations with any party other than Buyer with
respect to any of the foregoing.

4.9 No Registration. Such Company Seller understands that the shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement have not been,
and will not be, registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the
availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature
of the investment intent and the accuracy of such Company Seller's
representations as expressed herein or otherwise made pursuant hereto.

4.10 Investment Intent. Such Company Seller is acquiring the shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for investment
for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and that such Company
Seller has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or
otherwise distributing the same. Such Company Seller further represents that
it does not have any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer or grant
participation to such Person or to any other Person with respect to any of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

4.11 Investment Experience. Such Company Seller has substantial experience in
evaluating and investing in private placement transactions of securities and
acknowledges that such Company Seller can protect its own interests. Such
Company Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so that such Company Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in Buyer.

4.12 Speculative Nature of Investment. Such Company Seller understands and
acknowledges that an investment in Buyer involves risk. The Company Seller can
bear the economic risk of such Company Seller's investment in Buyer Common
Stock.



4.13 Accredited Investor. Such Company Seller is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated by the SEC under
the Securities Act and shall submit to Buyer such further assurances of such
status as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. Such Company Seller has
furnished or made available to Buyer any and all information requested by
Buyer to satisfy any applicable verification requirements as to "accredited
investor" status. Any such information is true, correct, timely and complete.

4.14 Residency; Principal Place of Business. The residency of such Company
Seller (or, in the case of a partnership or corporation, such entity's
principal place of business) is correctly set forth on Schedule I hereto.

4.15 Rule 144. Such Company Seller acknowledges that the shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement must be held indefinitely
unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from
such registration is available. Such Company Seller is aware of the provisions
of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit resale of shares
purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, which may include, among other things, the availability of certain
current public information about Buyer; the resale occurring not less than a
specified period after a party has purchased and paid for the security to be
sold; the number of shares being sold during any three-month period not
exceeding specified limitations; the sale being effected through a "brokers'
transaction," a transaction directly with a "market maker" or a "riskless
principal transaction" (as those terms are defined in the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder); and
the filing of a Form 144 notice, if applicable. Such Company Seller
acknowledges and understands that Buyer may not be satisfying the current
public information requirement of Rule 144 at the time such Company Seller
wishes to sell the shares of Buyer Common Stock, and that, in such event, such
Company Seller may be precluded from selling such securities under Rule 144,
even if the other applicable requirements of Rule 144 have been satisfied.
Such Company Seller acknowledges that, in the event the applicable
requirements of Rule 144 are not met, registration under the Securities Act or
an exemption from registration will be required for any disposition of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock. Such Company Seller understands that, although
Rule 144 is not exclusive, the SEC has expressed its opinion that persons
proposing to sell restricted securities received in a private offering other
than in a registered offering or pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial
burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is
available for such offers or sales and that such persons and the brokers who
participate in the transactions do so at their own risk.

4.16 Tax Advisors. Such Company Seller has reviewed with its own tax advisors
the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to such matters,
such Company Seller has relied solely on such advisors and not on any
statements or representations of Buyer or any of its agents, written or oral.
Such Company Seller acknowledges and agrees that it (and not Buyer) shall be
responsible for its own Tax liability that may arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

4.17 Legends. Such Company Seller understands and agrees that the stock
certificates evidencing the shares of Buyer Common Stock or the shares of
capital stock of Buyer issued upon any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or similar event with respect to such
shares of Buyer Common Stock, shall bear the following legend:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE, AND
MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR ASSIGNED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER
SUCH ACT AND/OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR UNLESS THE ISSUER HAS
RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR OTHER EVIDENCE, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO
THE ISSUER AND ITS COUNSEL, THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED."

Upon the request of a Company Seller, such legend shall be removed and Buyer
shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder thereof at such
time as the shares of Buyer Common Stock evidenced thereby cease to be
restricted securities upon the earliest to occur of (i) a registration
statement with respect to the sale of such shares of Buyer Common Stock shall
have become effective under the Securities Act and such shares of Buyer Common
Stock shall



have been disposed of in accordance with such registration statement, (ii)
such shares of Buyer Common Stock shall have been sold to the public pursuant
to Rule 144 (or any successor provision) under the Securities Act, or (iii)
such shares of Buyer Common Stock may be sold by the holder without
restriction, volume limitation or registration under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any successor provision); provided that in the case of (ii)
and (iii), such Company Seller completes any standard Rule 144 representation
letter that is required by Buyer's transfer agent or legal counsel.

In addition, the shares of Buyer Common Stock evidencing the Holdback
Consideration shall also contain the legend set forth below until such shares
are released to the Company Sellers in accordance with Section 2.6 hereof.

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

Buyer represents and warrants to the Company Sellers and the Company, as of

jurisdictions that recognize that concept) to do business in each jurisdiction

of the transactions contemplated herein or therein have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of Buyer and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Buyer are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
by Buyer or to consummate the transactions contemplated herein or therein.

(b) Due Execution. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which
Buyer is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto) the valid and binding obligations of Buyer enforceable
against them in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the
Remedies Exceptions.

5.3 Non-Contravention and Consents.

(a) Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each

Agreement and each other Transaction Document by Buyer will not (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Buyer Charter Documents; (ii) conflict
with or violate any Applicable Laws; or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or impair the rights of Buyer or alter the
rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, pursuant to any
Contract, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of Buyer's assets or
properties pursuant to, any obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which
Buyer may be bound.

(b) Contractual Consents. No Consent under any Contract to which Buyer is a
party is required to be obtained in connection with the execution, delivery or

control.

5.6 Solvency. Buyer has sufficient capital to deliver the aggregate cash
consideration contemplated by this Agreement to be delivered to the Company
Sellers.

5.7 SEC Reports. Since January 1, 2017, Buyer has filed or furnished, as
applicable, on a timely basis all required forms, reports and documents
required to be filed by Buyer with the SEC (such required forms, reports and
documents since such date, the "SEC Reports"), and all such SEC Reports,
including the footnotes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied through the periods indicated. The consolidated balance
sheets of Buyer contained in the SEC Reports fairly present, in all material
respects, the financial condition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof, and the related statements of income and cash flows
fairly present, in all material respects, the results of operations of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated. Each SEC Report
filed by Buyer was, at the time of its filing, in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable



requirements of the Exchange Act and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to such SEC Report. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment), the SEC Reports did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

5.8 Exclusive Representations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as
set forth in Article III and Article IV hereof (and, with respect to the
Retained Unitholders only, Section 8.15 herein), no other representations or
warranties have been made to Buyer or any of its officers, directors, managers
or stockholders, or any agent, employee, representative or any affiliate
thereof relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the
Company or the Company Units, and that in entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, Buyer is
not relying upon information other than that contained in this Agreement and
the results of such parties' own independent investigation.

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

6.1 Transaction Expenses. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide Buyer a schedule of all Transaction Expenses
incurred to date and shall provide Buyer with a certificate setting forth (a)
the identity of each Person that is to be paid any Transaction Expenses; (b)
the amount owed or to be owed to each such Person; and (c) the bank account
and wire transfer information for each such Person.

6.2 Employment Matters.

(a) From the Closing Date and continuing until December 31, 2018, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause the Company to provide, to each employee of the
Company who continues to be employed by the Buyer and/or the Company following
the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee") with, to the extent employed by
the Buyer and/or the Company, (i) base pay, commission opportunities, and cash
bonus opportunities, as applicable, that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date (as determined in good faith by Buyer in its sole discretion) and
(ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that, for purposes of determining whether such pay, opportunities,
and benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate, defined benefit pension
plan benefits and retention, sale, stay, or change in control payments or
awards shall not be taken into account.

(b) Those Continuing Employees set forth on Schedule 6.2(b) (collectively, the
"Equity Plan Participants") shall be presented with Restricted Stock
Agreements promptly following the first regularly scheduled quarterly meeting
of the Buyer's Compensation Committee following the Closing, pursuant to which
such Continuing Employees will be granted the right to receive the applicable
amounts of Buyer Common Stock set forth on Schedule 6.2(b) under Buyer's 2010
Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Buyer Equity Incentive Plan"), in
accordance with current practices for the grant by Buyer of stock incentives;
provided that under the terms of the Restricted Stock Agreements the quarterly
vesting schedule shall commence no later than the earlier of (i) the actual
grant date of the Buyer Common Stock to an Equity Plan Participant, or (ii)
July 1, 2018; provided further that if the Compensation Committee does not
grant the equity awards to eligible Continuing Employees in the amounts set
forth on Schedule 6.2(b), the Equity Participants will receive incentive award
of cash vesting on the terms set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement,
attached hereto as Exhibit F. The terms and conditions pursuant to which
equity based compensation are granted are determined by the provisions of the
Restricted Stock Agreements and Buyer Equity Incentive Plan.

(c) To the extent that Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in
any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained
by Buyer or any of its affiliates, excluding the Buyer Equity Incentive Plan,
(collectively the "Buyer Plans") then, for purposes of determining (i)
eligibility to participate and vesting and (ii) solely with respect to any
Buyer Plan that provides for severance, vacation, or paid-time-off benefits,
for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall be treated as service with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to the extent recognized by the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition



would result in any duplication of benefits, and Buyer shall not be required
credit for such service for eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual purposes
under any Buyer Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or postretirement
medical plan. In addition, subject to the terms of the applicable Buyer Plan
and applicable law, Buyer shall provide each Continuing Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Buyer Plans that are welfare plans in which such
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.2, nothing contained in this
Section 6.2, express or implied, shall (i) be treated as the establishment,
amendment or modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan or,
subject to compliance with the requirements of Section 6.2(a) and Section
6.2(c), constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge, or
terminate after the Closing Date any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan, (ii)
give any current or former employee, director, or other independent contractor
of the Company and its Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan
or Buyer Plan or (B) retain the employment or services of any current or
former employee, director, or other independent contractor.

6.3 Related-Party Transactions. In consideration of the Purchase Price
payments and other good and valuable consideration the sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company and each of the Company Sellers hereby
acknowledges and agrees that all of the Contracts between the Company, on the
one hand, and such Company Seller or their respective Affiliates, on the other
(other than this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, Contracts set forth on
Schedule 6.3 and Contracts contemplated in Section 6.8), shall, on the Closing
Date and without further action by any of the Parties hereto, terminate and be
of no further force or effect and each of the Company Sellers hereby
acknowledges and agrees that no further payments are due, or may become due,
under or in respect of any such terminated Contracts. In addition, on or prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay or otherwise satisfy all
obligations of the Company to any Company Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than obligations of the Company to its employees for accrued
salary for the current payroll period). The Company hereby confirms that,
effective as of the Closing, the NovelPay, LLC 2015 Profit Interest Equity
Plan, as amended, shall, without further action by any of the Parties hereto,
terminate and be of no further force or effect.

6.4 General Release. Effective at the Closing, each Company Seller, on his or
her own behalf and on behalf of his or her respective heirs, family members,
executors, agents, and assigns ("Releasors"), hereby and forever releases
Buyer and the Company and their past, present and future officers, agents,
managers, employees, investors, stockholders, administrators, affiliates,
parents, predecessor and successor corporations and assigns (collectively, the
"Releasees") from, and agrees not to sue concerning, or in any manner to
institute, prosecute, or pursue, any claim, complaint, charge, duty,
obligation, or cause of action relating to any matters of any kind, whether
presently known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that such Releasors may
possess against any of the Releasees arising from any omissions, acts, facts,
or damages relating to any matter involving such Company Seller's relationship
with the Company occurring prior to the Closing, including the right to any
payments in respect of any Company Units held thereby as of immediately prior
to the Closing, other than the payments, in the amounts and subject to the
terms, explicitly set forth in this Agreement or, to the extent applicable,
the TopCo Merger Agreement (collectively, but excluding the Excluded Matters
described below, the "Released Matters"). Such Releasors agree that the
release set forth in this section shall be and remain in effect in all
respects as a complete general release as to the matters released. The
foregoing notwithstanding, this release does not extend to any rights of such
Releasor (a) under the explicit terms of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, (b) for any accrued and unpaid salary and other unpaid
employee benefits and reimbursements that have vested or accrued prior to the
Closing, including any vacation pay or paid time off, (c) to any transaction
bonuses payable pursuant to a written employment agreement (which for the
avoidance of doubt constitute Transaction Expenses hereunder), in each case
owed by the Company or, to the extent applicable, TopCo, (d) to any Releasor's
rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses (whether under the
Company Charter Documents, insurance policy or other Contract of the Company),
(e) with respect any claims that cannot be released as a matter of law or (f)
that arise after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Excluded Matters").
Each of such Releasors, having consulted with counsel, hereby agrees and
acknowledges that he, she or it is aware that applicable laws in such
Releasor's state of domicile may provide that such Releasor has the right not
to release existing claims of which such Releasor is not aware unless such
Releasor voluntarily chooses to waive this right and



that such Releasor nevertheless hereby voluntarily waives such right and
elects to assume all risks for all Released Matters that now exist in his, her
or its favor, known or unknown. Each Company Seller represents that he or she
has no lawsuits, claims, or actions pending in his or her name, or on behalf
of any other Person, against Buyer or the Company or any of the other
Releasees with respect to the Released Matters, and that he or she does not
intend to bring any claims on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person against the Company or any of the other Releasees with respect to the
Released Matters.

6.5 Spreadsheet.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer a draft spreadsheet in substantially the form of Schedule I
attached hereto (the "Payment Spreadsheet") setting forth the following
information, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer:

(i) a calculation of the Adjusted Equity Value, the Purchase Price, and each
component of all of the foregoing; and

(ii) with respect to each Company Seller: (A) the name and address of such
Company Seller, (B) the number and class of all Company Units held by such
Company Seller, (C) the cash portion of such Company Seller's Individual
Closing Payment Amount, (D) the Buyer Common Stock portion of such Company
Seller's Individual Closing Payment Amount, (E) each Retained Unitholder's
Put/Call Amount, (F) the number of 1st Anniversary Holdback Shares to be
issued to such Company Seller upon release of such shares in accordance with
and subject to Section 2.6, (G) such Company Seller's Holdback Pro Rata
Portion, (H) such Company Seller's Pro Rata Portion, (I) the amount of any
required withholding on account of Taxes with respect to such Company Seller's
Individual Purchase Price Amount, and (J) the wire transfer instructions of
such Company Seller with respect to the payments to be made by Buyer pursuant
to Section 2.4. No consent or approval of Buyer in respect of the Payment
Spreadsheet shall be required in and of itself as a condition to Closing.

(b) Buyer, any paying agent engaged by Buyer, and, following the Closing, the
Company, may rely on the instructions of the Sellers' Representative for
distributions of cash and issuances of Buyer Common Stock and shall have no
responsibility or liability with respect thereto; provided, that the
distribution and issuance instructions of the Sellers' Representative are
followed. Buyer shall, or shall cause a paying agent engaged by Buyer to, make
distributions of cash and issuances of Buyer Common Stock after the Closing to
the Company Seller in the same form and in accordance with the same wiring
instructions or delivery addresses, as applicable, as such distributions were
made to each such Company Seller in connection with the Closing, except as
otherwise indicated in any update delivered to Buyer by the Sellers'
Representative to reflect any assignments or other changes in factual
information. Upon Buyer making each aggregate payment or issuance of Buyer
Common Stock, required of it under this Agreement to the Company Seller in
accordance with the final Payment Spreadsheet delivered by the Sellers'
Representative prior to the Closing as provided herein, Buyer shall have
fulfilled its obligations with respect to such payments and issuances, as
applicable. Buyer shall have, neither directly nor indirectly through the
Company following the Closing, no liability whatsoever with respect to the
allocation of the distribution of the payments of the Adjusted Equity Value
among the Company Sellers.

(c) No party to this Agreement shall take any tax or other position that is
contrary to the allocations set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

6.6 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company Sellers, on the other (severally
based on their respective Pro Rata Portion), shall be equally responsible for
and shall each pay one half of all stock transfer Taxes, real property
transfer or mortgage Taxes, sales Taxes, documentary stamp Taxes, recording
charges and other similar Taxes, if any, arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). The Party primarily
responsible under Applicable Laws shall prepare and file, and each Party shall
fully cooperate with each other Party



with respect to the preparation and filing of, any Tax Returns and other
filings relating to any Transfer Taxes as may be required.

(b) Preparation of Tax Returns.

(i) The Sellers' Representative shall timely prepare, or shall cause to be
prepared, all income Tax Returns of the Company (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any IRS Forms 1065 or Schedules K-1) with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period that are filed after the Closing Date (the "Seller Prepared Tax
Returns"). All such Seller Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared at the cost
and expense of the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Company
Sellers and the TopCo Sellers) and in a manner consistent with past practice
and this Agreement, except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws. The
Sellers' Representative shall deliver a draft of such Seller Prepared Tax
Returns (together with any related workpapers, formulary apportionment
calculations and supporting materials) to Buyer for its review and comment not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Seller Prepared Tax
Returns are due to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions).
Within fifteen (15) days following Buyer's receipt of any Seller Prepared Tax
Return, Buyer shall notify the Sellers' Representative in writing with any
comments to such Seller Prepared Tax Return. The Sellers' Representative shall
consider any such reasonable comments of Buyer with respect to such Seller
Prepared Tax Returns in good faith and Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
such Seller Prepared Tax Return.

(ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
Straddle Periods due after the Closing Date that are not Seller Prepared Tax
Returns (the "Buyer Prepared Tax Returns"). The cost and expense of such
preparation and filing with respect to Buyer Prepared Tax Returns for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods shall be borne by the Sellers' Representative (for the
benefit of the Company Sellers and the TopCo Sellers) and the cost and expense
of such preparation and filing with respect to Buyer Prepared Tax Returns for
Straddle Periods shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Company Sellers
and the TopCo Sellers), on the other hand, based on the number of days in such
Straddle Period occurring prior to or on the Closing Date and the number of
days in such Straddle Period occurring after the Closing Date. Schedule
6.6(b)(ii) sets forth a complete and correct list of the Buyer Prepared Tax
Returns. All Buyer Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice and this Agreement, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Laws. Buyer shall deliver a draft of any income or other material
Buyer Prepared Tax Returns to the Sellers' Representative for its review and
comment as soon as reasonably practicable (which, in the case of income Tax
Returns, shall be not less than thirty (30) days) prior to the date on which
such Buyer Prepared Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions). As soon as reasonably practicable (which, in the case
of income Tax Returns, shall be within fifteen (15) days) following the
Sellers' Representative's receipt of any such Buyer Prepared Tax Return, the
Sellers' Representative shall notify Buyer in writing with any comments to
such Buyer Prepared Tax Return. To the extent such comments relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, Buyer
shall consider such reasonable comments of the Sellers' Representative with
respect to such Buyer Prepared Tax Returns in good faith. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall
not be required to provide any U.S. federal consolidated income Tax Return (or
any combined, consolidated, unified or similar income Tax Return) required to
be filed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates as the "common parent" of an
"affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or any
similar or analogous provision of applicable income Tax law), or any portion
thereof, in any form or manner whatsoever to any other Person pursuant to this
Agreement, and in no event shall the Sellers' Representative have any right to
review or comment on any such Tax Return or any position taken therein.

(iii) The Parties will cause a valid election under Section 754 of the Code to
be made and maintained with respect to the Company for its taxable year that
includes the Closing Date. The Tax Items of the Company shall be allocated for
Tax Return reporting purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
Laws, between the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of Straddle Periods by
using the "closing of the books method" as of the end of the Closing Date.

(c) Allocation. The Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall allocate the
purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) of the
Company Units sold in the Company Purchase among the



assets of the Company in accordance with Section 751 and Section 755 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within thirty (30) Business Days
after all items of the Final Closing Statement have become final, conclusive
and binding pursuant to Section 2.5 or as soon thereafter as reasonably
practicable, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative an
allocation of such purchase price (such allocation, the "Allocation Schedule")
for the Sellers' Representative's review. The Sellers' Representative and
Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputed items with respect
to the Allocation Schedule and, if the Sellers' Representative and Buyer
cannot resolve such disputed items following such cooperation, Sellers'
Representative and Buyer shall engage the Accounting Firm to determine the
final resolution with respect to such disputed items. For this purpose, the
procedures set forth in Section 2.5(e) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, and all
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the parties in the
manner set forth in Section 2.5(e). Any determinations made by the Accounting
Firm in connection with the foregoing shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties. Any adjustment to purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes) of the Company Units sold in the Company Purchase shall
be allocated among the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with this
Section 6.6(c). All Tax Returns filed by Buyer (and any Buyer's designee(s),
as applicable), the Company Sellers, the Company, and their Affiliates shall
be prepared consistently with the allocation as set forth on the Allocation
Schedule (and, to the extent applicable, any updates or any determinations by
the Accounting Firm with respect thereto), except upon a final determination
by a Taxing Authority.

(d) Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes of the Company not based upon or measured by income, activities, events,
gain, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items for the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date will be deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period. The amount of
any other Taxes for a Straddle Period that relate to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date will be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose the taxable period of any partnership will
be deemed to end at such time); provided, however, that any item determined on
an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation or real
estate Taxes), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be apportioned on a daily basis; provided, further, that any
deductions allowed to be claimed by the Company in respect of any Transaction
Expenses shall be claimed as a deduction by the Company for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws.

(e) Amended Returns; Tax Elections. Except as required by Applicable Laws or
as set forth on Schedule 6.6(e), Buyer will not, and will cause the Company
not to, without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(i) make any amendment of any Tax Return of the Company to the extent such Tax
Return relates to or includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period or (ii) make any election that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date.

(f) Certain Tax Proceedings. In the event Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
(including after the Closing the Company) receives written notice of any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company that
would reasonably be expected to result in an Indemnified Tax Loss for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1(a) or an adjustment to
the taxable income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of any Company Seller,
Buyer shall inform the Sellers' Representative of such Tax Proceeding as soon
as possible but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt.
Buyer shall afford the Sellers' Representative the opportunity to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding relating to income Taxes (a "Seller-Controlled
Tax Proceeding"), with counsel of its own choosing (and at the Sellers'
Representative's sole cost and expense (for the benefit of the Company Sellers
and the TopCo Sellers)), and to settle or otherwise resolve such Seller-
Controlled Tax Proceeding in such manner as the Sellers' Representative may
deem appropriate; provided, that the Sellers' Representative may not settle
such Seller-Controlled Tax Proceeding without Buyer's written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The
Sellers' Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of any material
developments and events in such Seller-Controlled Tax Proceeding (including by
promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of any related correspondence) and shall
permit Buyer to participate in such Seller-Controlled Tax Proceeding and shall
consult in good faith with Buyer in connection with the defense or prosecution
of any such Seller-Controlled Tax



Proceeding. Buyer shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax
Proceeding relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company (if such Tax
Proceeding is not a Seller-Controlled Tax Proceeding) and any Straddle Periods
of the Company (any such Tax Proceeding, a "Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding");
provided, that Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a Buyer-Controlled Tax
Proceeding or ceasing to defend such Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding if such
settlement or cessation would reasonably be expected to give rise to
Indemnified Tax Loss for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.1(a) or to result in an adjustment to the taxable income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of any Company Seller (including as a result of any
election by the Company under Section 6226 of the Code or any corresponding
election under the Treasury Regulations or any state or local law with respect
to such Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding (a "Push-Out Election")); and,
provided further, that the Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose (the fees and expenses of which
separate counsel shall be borne solely by the Sellers' Representative (for the
benefit of the Company Sellers and the TopCo Sellers)) if such Buyer-
Controlled Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to give rise to an
Indemnified Tax Loss for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.1(a) or to result in an adjustment to the taxable income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of any Company Seller (including as a result of any
Push-Out Election). Buyer shall keep the Sellers' Representative informed of
all material developments and events relating to any Buyer-Controlled Tax
Proceeding (including promptly forwarding copies to the Sellers'
Representative of any related correspondence), and shall consult in good faith
with the Sellers' Representative or the Sellers' Representative\'s counsel in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Buyer-Controlled Tax
Proceeding, in each case, if such Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding would
reasonably be expected to give rise to an Indemnified Tax Loss for which Buyer
is entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1(a) or result in an adjustment
to the taxable income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of any Company Seller
(including as a result of any Push-Out Election). For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 6.6(f) shall apply, rather than Section 7.2 to any Seller-
Controlled Tax Proceeding or Buyer-Controlled Tax Proceeding to the extent of
any conflict between such Sections.

(g) Cooperation and Tax Record Retention. Buyer and any designee(s) of Buyer,
as applicable shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly furnish to
any of the Company Sellers (at such Company Seller's sole cost and expense for
reasonable out-of-pocket third party expenses) or the Sellers' Representative
(at the Sellers' Representative sole cost and expense for reasonable out-of-
pocket third party expenses for the benefit of the Company Sellers and the
TopCo Sellers) such information as may be reasonably requested with respect to
Tax matters relating to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-
Closing portion of any Straddle Periods, including by providing access to
relevant books and records and making employees available to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, Buyer and any
designee(s) of Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Periods until at least
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking
into account any extensions thereof) applicable to such Taxable periods, and
shall abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority.

(h) Tax Attributes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any Company Seller is
making any representation or warranty and is not providing any other
assurance, with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the Company, or
with respect to the availability after the Closing of any Tax Attributes of
the Company.

(i) Tax Treatment. The Parties agree that for U.S. federal income (and
applicable state and local income) tax purposes, the Company Purchase shall be
treated as a purchase of partnership interests.

6.7 EandO Tail Policy. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a 3-year
errors and omissions tail policy with respect to Company's current errors and
omissions liability insurance coverage maintained by the Company with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing
(collectively, the "EandO Tail Policy"). The Company shall be responsible for
the cost of the EandO Tail Policy and such amount shall be deemed a Transaction
Expense for purposes of this Agreement. The EandO Tail Policy shall contain
terms and



coverage amounts at least as favorable as the terms and coverage amounts of
the policies of the Company as currently in effect.



6.8 Indemnification of Officers and Managers of the Company; Insurance.



(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, continue to provide, fulfill
and honor all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of a
manager, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company (including rights
relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to which such
persons are entitled), as provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (and as permitted by
Applicable Law), and relating to actions or events through the Closing Date,
and such rights to indemnification shall survive the Company Purchase and
other transactions contemplated herein, and shall continue in full force and
effect, without any amendment thereto for a period of six years following the
Closing.



(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have purchased a three (3) year tail or
extension of coverage policy with respect to Company's current managers' and
officers' liability insurance coverage maintained by Company with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing
(including consummation of the Company Purchase) (the "DandO Tail Policy") . The
Company shall be responsible for the cost of the DandO Tail Policy and such
amount shall be deemed a Transaction Expense for purposes of this Agreement.

(C) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Affiliate of the Company, his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives and shall survive the Company Purchase
and other transactions contemplated herein, and be binding upon the successors
and assigns of Buyer and the Company.

6.9 Further Assurances. Upon the request of Buyer, each of the other Parties
hereto will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, all such further acts,
assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments
and papers as may be reasonably requested by any other Party to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the consummation of a
Put/Call Closing).

6.10 Public Announcements. The Company and Buyer have agreed upon the form of
a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement to be
released immediately following the Closing. Following the Closing, except as
required to comply with Applicable Law, (i) no Company Seller or the Sellers'
Representative shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the express prior written approval of Buyer, and (ii) Buyer
will not issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
filing that contains specific information naming any Company Seller or any
TopCo Seller or disclosing the specific ownership or proceeds received by such
Company Seller or TopCo Seller without the express prior written approval of
the Company Seller or the TopCo Seller so impacted.

6.11 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party will
pay its own respective financial advisory, legal, accounting and other
expenses incurred by it or for its benefit in connection with the preparation
and execution of this Agreement, the compliance herewith and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.12 Attorney Communications; Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Davis and Gilbert LLP has been providing
legal advice to the Company and TopCo in connection with this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and that such advice constitutes attorney/client privileged
communications or attorney work product (collectively, the "Attorney Work
Product"). Buyer shall not knowingly review any such Attorney Work Product.
Buyer hereby waives the right to present any Attorney Work Product as evidence
in any lawsuit or proceeding in which any Company Seller, TopCo Seller or the
Sellers' Representative (on their behalf) is adverse to Buyer (or any Buyer
Indemnified Party) in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



(b) Recognizing that Davis and Gilbert LLP has been providing legal advice to
the Company and TopCo, and that Davis and Gilbert LLP may act as legal counsel
to certain of the Company Sellers and TopCo Sellers after the Closing, (i) the
Company hereby waives, on their own behalf and agree to cause their Affiliates
to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Davis and Gilbert LLP
representing the Company Sellers and/or TopCo Sellers after the Closing and
(ii) the Company hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
between or among any of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, the
Company) and any Company Seller and/or TopCo Seller, each of the Parties agree
that Davis and Gilbert LLP may represent such Company Seller and/or TopCo Seller
in such dispute even though the interests of such Company Seller and/or TopCo
Seller may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company), and even though Davis and Gilbert LLP may have represented the
Company and/or TopCo in a matter substantially related to such dispute, Buyer
and the Company waive, on behalf of themselves, TopCo and each of their
respective Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such
representation by Davis and Gilbert LLP. Buyer acknowledges, on behalf of
itself, TopCo and the Company, that each has had the opportunity to discuss
and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks
of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and
other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Davis and Gilbert LLP. This Section 6.12 is for the benefit
of Davis and Gilbert LLP (including their respective partners and employees),
which are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.12.

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Buyer Indemnified
Losses. Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, from and after the
Closing, each of the Company Sellers, severally agrees, based on their
respective Indemnity Pro Rata Portion, to indemnify and hold harmless, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against the Applicable Percentage of any
and all Buyer Indemnified Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party. The
Sellers' Representative shall act on behalf of the Company Sellers, and the
Buyer is hereby authorized to rely on determinations or communications by the
Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Company Sellers, in connection with
the indemnification provided under Section 7.1(a).

(b) Special Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties. Subject to the
provisions of this Article VII, from and after the Closing, each of the
Company Sellers hereby severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all Losses
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with, based upon,
resulting from, attributable to, related to, or arising out of (i) any breach
or inaccuracy by such Company Seller of any of its representations or
warranties under Article IV of this Agreement or Section 8.14 (with respect to
the Retained Unitholders only) or (ii) any violation, breach or default by
such Company Seller of any covenants or agreements of such Company Seller
under this Agreement.

(c) Materiality Scrape. For purposes of determining the indemnification
obligations under this Section 7.1, except for the Specified Instances
(defined below), all references in this Agreement to the word "material,"
"material respects," "material adverse effect" and "Material Adverse Effect"
(and similar materiality qualifications), shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining (i) whether there has been a breach or failure of a representation
or warranty for which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement and (ii) the amount of any Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder. "Specified Instances" means the use of the words
"material" and "all material respects" as such terms are used in Section 3.5.
It is agreed that the provisions of this Section 7.1(c) shall not change the
titles of or change what otherwise constitutes a "Material Customer",
"Material Supplier" and "Material Contract".

7.2 Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) If any third party notifies any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to
any matter (a "Third-Party Action") that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Article VII, then
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly notify, with respect to a claim
for indemnification under Section



7.1(a), the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Company Sellers or, with
respect to a claim for indemnification under Section 7.1(b), the applicable
Company Seller in writing (the "Third-Party Claim Notice"); provided, that no
failure or delay on the part of the Buyer Indemnified Party to so notify the
Sellers' Representative or such Company Seller, as the case may be, shall
limit any of the obligations of the applicable Indemnifying Party under
Article VII, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party has been
materially prejudiced thereby. The Third-Party Claim Notice shall include a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and, if
ascertainable, the amount of the claim. The Sellers' Representative or the
applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to control
the defense of such Third-Party Action if it notifies the Buyer Indemnified
Party of its election within 30 days after it receives a Third Party Claim
Notice from the Buyer Indemnified Party.

(b) The Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of
the Company Sellers) or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be,
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of the Third-Party Action and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony and shall attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings and trials as may be reasonably requested
in connection with such Third-Party Action; provided, that it shall not be
required to grant access or furnish information to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege; and provided further, that the Buyer Indemnified Party and the
Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be,
and/or their counsel shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so
as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss
of attorney/client or attorney work product privilege. Each Party shall act in
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in addressing any adverse
consequences that may result in the basis for an indemnifiable claim.

(c) In the event that the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Company
Sellers) or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, elects not to
defend the Third-Party Action, fails to timely respond to a Third-Party Claim
Notice or otherwise fails to defend the Third-Party Action in good faith, then
the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party
Action in such manner as the Buyer Indemnified Party deems appropriate. In
addition, in the event the Third-Party Action involves a Special Claim, then
Buyer shall have the right to control such claim at its sole election and, if
Buyer so elects, the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller,
as the case may be, shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in
the defense or settlement of, such Special Claim.

(d) If within 30 days after a Third-Party Claim Notice is delivered to the
Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be,
such Person does not notify the Buyer Indemnified Party that it disputes such
claim, the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the applicable Indemnifying Party hereunder.

(e) In the event that, within 30 days after a Third-Party Claim Notice is
delivered to the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as
the case may be, such Person disputes the claim for indemnification against
the applicable Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Action, the
Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative or the applicable
Company Seller, as the case may be, shall attempt in good faith for 30 days to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to such claim. If
the Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative or the applicable
Company Seller, as the case may be, should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement and the agreed upon dollar amount of liability for such
claim of the Indemnifying Party against whom the claim is made shall be
prepared and signed by (or on behalf of) the parties. If the parties do not
agree, each of the Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative or
the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, may take such actions and
assert such rights, remedies and defenses as may then be available to it under
the terms of this Agreement.

(f) In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party has the right to defend and control
a Third-Party Action in accordance with Section 7.2(c) and the Buyer
Indemnified Party proposes to settle or compromise such Third-Party Action,
the Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide notice to that effect (together with
a statement describing in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such
settlement or compromise and including a copy of the proposed settlement
agreement) to the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as
the case may be, which notice



shall be provided a reasonable time prior to the proposed time for effecting
such settlement or compromise. Prior to settling or compromising any such
Third-Party Action, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall obtain the written
consent of the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Company Sellers) or
the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Buyer Indemnified Party
effects any such settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Action with the
written consent of the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company
Seller, as the case may be, the amount payable pursuant to such settlement or
compromise plus any additional related indemnifiable Losses, if any, specified
in such consent shall, be payable by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party,
subject to the limitations and other provisions set forth in this Article VII.
If a Buyer Indemnified Party effects any such settlement or compromise without
the consent of the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller,
as the case may be, and such consent has not been unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, then the dollar amount of the settlement or compromise
shall not be dispositive of the dollar amount of the Indemnifying Parties'
obligations with respect to such Third-Party Action.

7.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which a Buyer Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 7.2, the Buyer
Indemnified Party will notify the Sellers' Representative or the applicable
Company Seller, as the case may be, in writing of any Losses which such Buyer
Indemnified Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms
hereof. Such notification must state in reasonable detail, to the extent such
information is reasonably available, the nature, amount and circumstances of
such claim, and be accompanied by any other documentation or information
reasonably required by the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company
Seller, as the case may be, to evaluate the claim. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VII, if the Sellers' Representative or the
applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, does not notify the Buyer
Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
written notification that the Sellers' Representative or the applicable
Company Seller, as the case may be, disputes all or any portion of such claim,
the amount of such undisputed claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability
of the Indemnifying Party hereunder (subject to the limitations on liability
set forth in Section 7.5 hereof). In case an objection is made in writing by
the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may
be, within such thirty (30)-day period, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have
thirty (30) days to respond in a written statement to the objection. If the
Buyer Indemnified Party so responds, or the time to respond has expired, and
there remains a dispute as to any claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party and the
Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company Seller, as the case may be,
shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to each such claim. If the Buyer
Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative or the applicable Company
Seller, as the case may be, do not agree within such thirty (30)-day period,
each of the Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative or the
applicable Company Seller, as the case may be, may take such actions and
assert such rights, remedies and defenses as may then be available to it under
the terms of this Agreement.

7.4 No Circular Recovery. The Sellers' Representative hereby agrees that it
will not, and no Company Seller shall, make any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses against Buyer by reason of the fact that such Company
Seller was a controlling person, officer, manager, member, unit holder
employee, agent or representative of the Company (whether such claim is
pursuant to any statute, Company Charter Document, Contract or otherwise) with
respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with
this Agreement.

7.5 Limits on Liability.

(a) Termination of Indemnification Obligations of the Company Sellers. The
obligation of the Company Sellers to indemnify under Section 7.1(a) for
Indemnified Company Representation Losses shall terminate on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, except (x) as to matters as to which the
Buyer Indemnified Party has made a good faith claim for indemnification under
Sections 7.2 or 7.3 hereof on or prior to such date and (y) with respect to
any claim for Indemnified Company Representation Losses pertaining to a
misrepresentation or a breach of a Fundamental Company Representation. The
obligation to indemnify referred to in:

(i) the preceding clause (x) shall survive the expiration of such period until
such claim for indemnification is finally resolved and any obligations with
respect thereto are fully satisfied; and



(ii) the preceding clause (y) shall terminate sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the relevant statute of limitations (taking into account any
extensions or waivers thereof), except as to matters as to which any Buyer
Indemnified Party has made a claim for indemnification on or prior to such
date, in which case the right to indemnification with respect thereto shall
survive the expiration of any such period until such claim for indemnification
is finally resolved and any obligations with respect thereto are fully
satisfied.

For avoidance of doubt, all covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth
in this Agreement shall survive until fully performed in accordance with their
respective terms.

(b) Minimum Claim Amount; Indemnity Threshold. The Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to be indemnified for any Indemnified Company
Representation Losses as to any individual indemnification claim with respect
to such Losses if the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to any such claim does not exceed $10,000
(the "Minimum Claim Amount"). For purposes of illustration and not limitation,
in determining whether the Minimum Claim Amount has been met, an individual
Loss occurring or arising out of a fact pattern shall be aggregated with all
other individual Losses arising out of identical or substantially similar fact
patterns. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to be
indemnified for any Indemnified Company Representation Losses unless and until
the sum of all Indemnified Company Representation Losses exceed $187,500 (the
"Threshold"); provided, however, that after the Threshold has been met, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified for all such
Indemnified Company Representation Losses including the amount of the
Threshold. The Parties agree that the limitations set forth in this Section
7.5(b) shall not apply to any breach of a Fundamental Company Representation
or Indemnified Company Representation Losses that arise as a result of Fraud.

(c) Maximum Liability. Except in the case of Fraud, (i) the maximum aggregate
liability of the Company Sellers under this Agreement shall be an amount equal
to 100% of the total Purchase Price paid or payable by the Buyer to the
Company Sellers pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 8.14 hereof, and (ii) each
Company Seller's individual liability for such claims shall not exceed such
Company Seller's Individual Purchase Price Amount.

(d) Exclusive Remedy for Indemnified Company Representation Losses is the
Holdback Consideration. Buyer agrees that the Holdback Consideration has been
withheld and held back by the Buyer to support the payment of indemnification
claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties following the Closing. Buyer, on
behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and
agrees that except with respect to Fraud and breaches by the Company of the
Fundamental Company Representations, recovery from the Holdback Consideration
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Indemnified Company Representation
Losses. Except with respect to Fraud and breaches by the Company of the
Fundamental Company Representations, any deduction made from the Holdback
Consideration in respect of an Indemnified Company Representation Loss
incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII shall
constitute full satisfaction of any obligation of each applicable Company
Seller to make such payment to the Buyer Indemnified Party.

(e) Clarification of Term "Losses". Except in the case of Fraud, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall any Indemnifying Party hereunder
be liable to a Buyer Indemnified Party for any punitive, exemplary or special
damages unless such damages were actually assessed against the Buyer
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third-Party Action. In addition, the
term "Losses" as used in this Agreement shall only include consequential
damages, damages for lost profits or any similar measure of damages if (i) the
Buyer Indemnified Party seeking such damages is able to prove all elements
necessary for recovery of such damages under Delaware law, or (ii) if such
damages were actually assessed against the Buyer Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third-Party Action.

(f) Insurance Proceeds. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Article VII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered
by a Buyer Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such
Loss, less such Buyer Indemnified Party's out-of-pocket costs of obtaining or
receiving such recovery, including any deductible paid in obtaining such
proceeds and increased costs of insurance related to the making of such claim,
including retrospective premium adjustments and experienced based premium
adjustments. In the event that an insurance recovery is made by any Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which such Person has been
indemnified hereunder and has received funds in the amount of the Losses or
portion thereof,



then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the insurance recovery (less
such Buyer Indemnified Party's reasonable out-of-pocket costs of receiving
such recovery, including any deductible paid in obtaining such proceeds and
increased costs of insurance related to the making of such claim), but in no
event in excess of the amount of such indemnification payment, shall be made
promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

In addition, in the event Buyer obtains actual knowledge that a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery under the EandO Tail Policy and/or the
DandO Tail Policy, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to submit to
the relevant insurance provider a corresponding claim for recovery.

(g) Duplication of Recovery. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right
to indemnification hereunder for any amount that was already included in the
Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Net Debt Amount or the Purchase
Price Overpayment amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

7.6 Procedures for Claims; Payment of Holdback Consideration.

(a) Claims. Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the Holdback Consideration by
the amount necessary to satisfy and pay the amount of any Buyer Indemnified
Losses with respect to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII by deducting from the Holdback
Consideration a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) the amount of such Buyer Indemnified Losses by (ii)
the Issue Price as of the Closing Date, if such reduction is with respect to
the 1st Anniversary Holdback Shares, or the Initial Release Date, if such
reduction is with respect to the 2nd Anniversary Holdback Shares.

(b) Distributions. The Holdback Consideration shall be distributed in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6 herein.

7.7 Exclusive Remedy. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
indemnification provisions of this Article VII and the adjustments set forth
in Section 2.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, except for (i) claims arising out of
Fraud and (ii) injunctive relief or specific performance and other equitable
remedies.

7.8 Acknowledgement of Sellers' Representative. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that any Buyer Indemnified Party shall only deal with the Sellers'
Representative with respect to an indemnification claim made pursuant to
Section 7.1(a) and the Company Sellers will be bound by any action or
agreement of the Sellers' Representative made on their behalf with respect to
an indemnification claim made pursuant to Section 7.1(a).

7.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnity payments by an
Indemnifying Party to a Buyer Indemnified Party under this Article VII shall
be treated by the Parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Adjusted
Equity Value.

7.10 Notices. Any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
required or permitted to be delivered, given or otherwise provided under this
Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered personally, delivered by
nationally recognized overnight courier service, or sent by electronic mail
(subject to electronic confirmation of receipt, if requested). Any such

courier service, if sent for overnight delivery by a nationally recognized
overnight courier service, or (c) the day of sending, if sent by facsimile or

will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which such successors and
permitted assigns will be deemed to be a Party for all purposes hereof. No
Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder, without the prior written
approval of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, and any attempt to do so
will be null and void ab initio.



Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of

Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the
case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (and in the
case of any amendment to Section 8.14, the prior written consent of each of
the Retained Unitholders as well), or in the case of a waiver, by the Party
against whom the waiver is to be effective (with the Buyer acting, after the
Closing, on behalf of the Company). No waiver by any Party of any breach or
violation of, default under or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent breach or violation of, default under, or inaccuracy
in, any such representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power
or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.

7.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with and any other documents,
instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals,

respect thereto. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants,
or undertakings, other than those expressly provided for herein and therein.

7.14 Counterparts; Facsimile Signature. This Agreement may be executed in any

will become effective when duly executed and delivered by each Party.

electronic delivery (i.e., by email of a PDF signature page) and each such
counterpart signature page will constitute an original for all purposes.

7.15 Provisions Concerning the Sellers' Representative.

(a) Appointment. At the Closing, and without further act of the Company or any
of the Company Sellers, the Sellers' Representative is hereby appointed as
agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the Company Sellers, for and on behalf
of the Company Sellers, to give and receive notices and communications and to
take any and all action on behalf of the Company Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as specified herein, except for matters involving a Company
Seller's individual indemnification obligations to a Buyer Indemnified Party
set forth in Section 7.1(b) hereof. Any vacancy in the position of the
Sellers' Representative may be filled by approval of the Company Sellers
entitled to receive at least a majority of the Purchase Price to be issued and
paid pursuant to Section 2.4. No bond will be required of the Sellers'
Representative, and the Sellers' Representative will not receive compensation
for its, his or her services; provided, that the Sellers' Representative will
be entitled to reimbursement of expenses pursuant to Section 8.6(c). Notices
or communications to or from the Sellers' Representative will constitute
notice to or from each of the Company Sellers. Each Company Seller, by virtue
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, has (i) agreed that all
actions taken by the Sellers' Representative under this Agreement shall be
binding upon such Company Seller and such Company Seller's successors, heirs
and permitted assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by
such Company Seller, (ii) waived any and all defenses which may be available
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Sellers' Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, and (iii) granted the Sellers'
Representative full power and authority to interpret all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof,
and to take all actions otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
on behalf of such Company Seller and his or her successors, heirs and
permitted assigns. The Sellers' Representative acknowledges that it has
carefully read and understands this Agreement and hereby accepts the
appointment and designation made hereunder.

(b) Actions of the Sellers' Representative. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers' Representative (acting in its capacity as the
Sellers' Representative as authorized under Section 8.6(a)) will constitute



a decision of all of the Company Sellers and will be final, conclusive and
binding upon each of the Company Sellers, and Buyer may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each of the Company Sellers;
provided, however, that any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers' Representative in respect of an individual Company Seller's breach
(or asserted breach) of any representation, warranty or covenant of such
Company Seller herein shall not be effective against such Company Seller
without the prior written consent of such Company Seller. Buyer is hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by Buyer in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers'
Representative. Sellers' Representative will be entitled to rely on the advice
of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably
determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to
any Company Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith
based on such advice or that it otherwise reasonably believes are necessary or
appropriate under the Agreement. The Sellers' Representative is serving in its
capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of any Company
Seller hereunder, and Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal
assets of Sellers' Representative, acting in such capacity, for the
satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by any of the Company Sellers
hereunder.

(c) Sellers' Representative Expense Fund. The Sellers' Representative Expense
Fund Amount will be used solely to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred by
the Sellers' Representative for the benefit of the Company Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement on or after the Closing Date, and will be paid or distributed
at the direction of the Sellers' Representative (the "Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund"). The Sellers' Representative Expense Fund will be held by the
Sellers' Representative as agent and for the benefit of the Company Sellers in
a segregated client account. The Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Company Sellers) will hold these funds in trust. Promptly following the Second
Release Date, the Sellers' Representative will distribute the then-remaining
balance of the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund (if any) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Company Sellers, based on their
respective Pro Rata Portion. For Tax purposes, the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Company Sellers at the time of Closing. Promptly following the
appointment of a successor Representative pursuant to Section 8.6(a), the
Sellers' Representative will transfer the then-remaining balance of the
Sellers' Representative Expense Fund, if any, to the successor Sellers'
Representative.

(d) In the event that any amount is owed by the Sellers' Representative in
respect of any actions it has taken hereunder, whether for fees, expense
reimbursement or otherwise, that is in excess of the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund (or after any or all of the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund
has been disbursed to the Company Sellers), the Sellers' Representative will
be entitled to be reimbursed by the Company Sellers, severally and not
jointly, for the shortfall in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portion. Each Company Seller hereby severally and not jointly, indemnifies the
Sellers' Representative for such Company Seller's Pro Rata Portion of any
costs, fees and expenses incurred by Sellers' Representative in excess of the
Sellers' Representative Expense Fund Amount arising out of its serving as the
Sellers' Representative hereunder.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Representative shall not have any
authority to take any action with respect to Section 8.14 hereunder, or to act
on behalf of any Retained Unitholder with respect to Section 8.14 or the
transactions contemplated therein.

7.16 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each
Party intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting
it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with,
and possible under, applicable laws.

LAWS.



7.18 Resolution of Disputes.

administrative agency to resolve a dispute between the parties arising out of

direct negotiation, the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute through

settlement of the dispute within a reasonable period of time (but no more than
three (3) weeks), any Party may then seek relief as provided in Section
8.9(c).

(c) Subject to Section 8.9(b), any legal action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
may only be instituted in any state or federal court in New Castle County,
Delaware, and each Party waives any objection which such Party may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or
proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in
any such action, suit or proceeding.

Section 8.9, each Party shall have the right to at any time apply to any court
of competent jurisdiction for preliminary injunctive relief.

(a) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

(e) Time is of the essence with regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement.

7.20 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT
ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OF IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR



ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO
TRAIL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT
SUCH ACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A
JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

7.21 Specific Enforcement. Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable harm
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that it does not fully and timely perform its
obligations under or in connection with this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement
and the Closing) in accordance with its terms. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that (a) the other Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages and without posting a bond, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such other Parties are entitled
under this Agreement and (b) the right to obtain an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties
would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law.

7.22 Limitation on Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or otherwise, no claim arising in whole or in part out of or related

including in connection with any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or

entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees from the non-prevailing party,
which fees may be set by the court in the trial of such action, or may be
