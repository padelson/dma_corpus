-iv-  _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _ _Agreement__ "), dated as of February
13, 2013, among AMR Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its successors
(including, as the context may require, on or after the effective date of the
Plan, as reorganized pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) (" _ _American__ "), US
Airways Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ _US Airways__ "), and AMR
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
American (" _ _Merger Sub__ "). Annex A to this Agreement contains a list of
defined terms that are used in this Agreement and the applicable Sections of
this Agreement in which each such term is defined.

_RECITALS _

WHEREAS, on November 29, 2011, American and certain of its direct and indirect
domestic Subsidiaries (each, a " _ _Debtor__ ", and collectively, the " _
_Debtors__ ") filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title
11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101 _et seq_. (the " _
_Bankruptcy Code__ ") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the " _ _Bankruptcy Court__ "), Case No. 11-15463 (SHL)
(Jointly Administered) (the " _ _Cases__ ");

 

WHEREAS, American and US Airways have determined to engage in a strategic
business combination whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into US
Airways, with US Airways continuing as the surviving entity in such merger as
a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of American (the " _ _Merger__ ");

WHEREAS, following the commencement of the Cases, American engaged in a
deliberative process that explored various strategic alternatives, including a
plan of reorganization in which the Debtors would emerge from the Cases
without entering into a strategic business combination and without obtaining
new equity investments of more than $1 billion (a " _ _Standalone Plan__ "),
and has determined, as of the date hereof, that implementation of the Merger
pursuant to the Plan will maximize value for the stakeholders of the Debtors;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of American, US Airways
and Merger Sub have, by resolutions duly adopted, declared that the Merger,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable, and
approved and adopted this Agreement;

WHEREAS, American and the other Debtors, with the support of the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors of American (the " _ _Creditors 
Committee__"), intend to seek the entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court
(the " _ _Confirmation Order__ ") approving the restructuring of the Debtors
pursuant to the Plan, including the approval of the Merger contemplated by
this Agreement, and the authorization of American to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;

WHEREAS, pursuant to and in accordance with the Plan, all allowed prepetition
general unsecured claims against the Debtors (other than intercompany
claims), all equity interests in American, and all rights of labor groups of
the Debtors to receive Newco Common Stock in

 



1  connection with the Plan, will be fully settled and satisfied with Plan
Shares, except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement and the
Plan;

 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger in
conjunction with the Plan will qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _ _Code__ "), and that this Agreement constitute the adoption of a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code;

WHEREAS, American, US Airways and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
the parties hereto, American and the other Debtors shall seek the entry of
the Merger Support Order, pursuant to which, among other things, the
Bankruptcy Court will approve this Agreement and the obligations of American
hereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of Section 7.1 of this Agreement, prior to
entry of the Merger Support Order, this Agreement is not effective and is not
binding or enforceable with respect to any party hereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, a commercial bank, trust

delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time,
American shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders

Certificates have the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All such
Newco Common Certificates and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to this Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__
".

transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties which (A)
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and (B) shall have such other provisions as American and US
Airways may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly

 



7  completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a Newco Common Certificate representing that number of whole shares
of Newco Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the aggregate number of shares of US Airways Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and a check
representing cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of US Airways Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of US Airways, a Newco Common Certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Newco Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and
a check representing cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions
that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c) may be
delivered to a transferee if the Certificate representing such US Airways
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that the holder of such Certificate has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (and
cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.2(c)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

(c) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Newco Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock deliverable upon
surrender thereof until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to escheat or other applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of Newco
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(c), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such number of whole shares of Newco Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in US Airways Common Stock_. The shares of
Newco Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon conversion of any shares of US Airways Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of US Airways Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of US Airways other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions that holders
have the right to receive upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance 

 



8  with Section 2.2(c), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of
US Airways shall be closed with respect to all shares of US Airways Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of US Airways
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of
US Airways Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Newco or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Newco, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Newco for
satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Newco, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Newco on a daily basis, _provided_ that,
subject to Section 2.2(e), no such investment or losses will affect the cash
payable to holders of Certificates. Any interest or other amounts received
with respect to such investments shall be paid to Newco.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Newco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement any amounts that it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code, Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be timely paid to
the appropriate Governmental Entity and treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Newco,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Newco may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.2(e), Newco)
shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake, volcano eruption or natural disaster;
_provided_ , _however_ , any such effect referred to in clauses (II), (VI) or

Effect has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur to the extent (but
only to the extent) such effect has a materially disproportionate impact on
such party or its Subsidiaries relative to other air carriers operating in the

Debtors as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date, (ii) was
entered into after the commencement of the Cases and is binding upon the
Debtors, (iii) was entered into prior to the commencement of the Cases but is
a type of Contract that can neither be assumed or rejected by the Debtors in
connection with the Cases but will be binding upon the Debtors upon Closing
after giving effect to the Confirmation Order and the occurrence of the

commencement of the Cases and is binding upon any non-Debtor Subsidiary of
American (each of the foregoing, a " _ _Binding American Contract__ ") or,
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and

transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in

clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,

or in the aggregate, (i) reasonably be expected to result in an American
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of American and its Subsidiaries to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) _American Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) American and each Subsidiary has filed or furnished all forms, statements,
schedules, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _ _SEC__ ") pursuant to
applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since December
31, 2011 (the " _ _American Audit__

 



14   _ _Date__ ") (the forms, statements, schedules, reports and documents filed
or furnished with the SEC since the American Audit Date and those filed or
furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, if any, including any amendments thereto, the " _
_American Reports__ "). Except as set forth in Section 3.1(e)(i) of the
American Disclosure Letter, each of the American Reports, at the time of its
filing, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied in all
material respects with the then applicable accounting standards. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the
American Reports did not, and any American Reports filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
corrected prior to the date of this Agreement by a subsequently filed
American Report. The American Reports included or will include all
certificates required to be included therein pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _ _SOX Act__ "), and the
internal control report and attestation of Americans outside auditors
required by Section 404 of the SOX Act.

 

(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the American Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of American Reports filed after
the date hereof, will fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of American and any other entity included
therein and their respective Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash
flows included in or incorporated by reference into the American Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case
of American Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present, in all
material respects, the net income, total stockholders equity and net increase
(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, as the case may be, of American and
any other entity included therein and their respective Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
the absence of full notes and normal year-end adjustments that are not
expected to be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _ _GAAP__ ") consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

(iii) The management of American (x) has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to American, including
its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of American by
others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation, to Americans outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of American (A) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Americans ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in

 



15  Americans internal controls over financial reporting. Since the American
Audit Date, any material change in internal control over financial reporting
required to be disclosed in any American Report has been so disclosed.

(iv) Since the American Audit Date, neither American nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to Americans Knowledge, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of American or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of American or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls relating to periods after the American Audit Date,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that American
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices (except for any of the foregoing which have no reasonable basis). "
_ _American s Knowledge__" shall mean the knowledge of those individuals
listed in Section 3.1(e)(iv) of the American Disclosure Letter, after
reasonable inquiry.

 

(v) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(e)(v) of the American Disclosure
Letter, there are no liabilities or obligations of American or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or
not required to be disclosed, or any other facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any obligations or liabilities of,
American or any of its Subsidiaries, other than: (A) liabilities or
obligations to the extent (I) accrued and reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet of American or (II) disclosed in the notes thereto, in
accordance with GAAP, in each case included in Americans quarterly report on

Effect.

 

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the
American Disclosure Letter, from the American Audit Date to the date of this
Agreement, American and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in accordance with, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court for the operation of
American. Since the American Audit Date, there has not been any American
Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, discovery or development
which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in an American Material Adverse Effect.

(g)  _Litigation_. Other than the Cases and the proceedings therein, or as
otherwise disclosed in American Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as
set forth in Section 3.1(g) of the American Disclosure Letter, there are no
(A) civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings,
arbitrations, investigations or proceedings

 



16  pending or, to Americans Knowledge, threatened against American or any of
its Subsidiaries (excluding any claims against the Debtors filed in the Cases)
or (B) litigations, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings, or
injunctions or final judgments relating to, pending or, to Americans
Knowledge, threatened against American or any of its Subsidiaries before any
Governmental Entity (excluding any claims against the Debtors filed in the
Cases), including the FAA, except in the case of either clause (A) or (B), for
those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in an American Material Adverse Effect. None of American or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which
would, individually or in the aggregate, (i) reasonably be expected to result
in an American Material Adverse Effect or (ii) reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of American and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) Section 3.1(h)(i) of the American Disclosure Letter contains, as of the
date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of each material American
Compensation and Benefit Plan, except with respect to that certain letter
agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. " _ _American Compensation
and Benefit Plan__ " means each employment agreement, and each bonus,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, equity compensation, severance
pay, change in control, medical, life insurance, profit-sharing, pension,
retirement, retiree medical, fringe benefit and each other material employee
benefit plan, program or agreement as to which American or any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or otherwise, for the benefit of,
with or relating to any current or former employee, officer or director of
American or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any governmental plan or
program or any statutory obligation.

(ii) With respect to each of the material American Compensation and Benefit
Plans, American has heretofore delivered or made available to US Airways true
and complete copies of each of the following documents: (A) the American
Compensation and Benefit Plan and most recent trust agreement and insurance
contract (including all amendments thereto), if any; (B) the most recent
annual report, actuarial report, and financial statement, if any; (C) the most
recent Summary Plan Description, together with each Summary of Material
Modifications, required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ _ERISA__ ") with respect to such American Compensation
and Benefit Plan, if any; and (D) the most recent determination letter
received from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _ _IRS__ ") with respect to
each American Compensation and Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(iii) Except to the extent covered by the Plan or as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have an American Material Adverse Effect, and except as
set forth in Section 3.1(h)(iii) of the American Disclosure Letter, all
obligations in respect of each American Compensation and Benefit Plan have
been properly accrued and reflected on the most recent consolidated statement
of operations and consolidated

 



17  balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the American Reports as
of the respective dates of such balance sheet or report to the extent required
by GAAP.

 

(iv) None of the American Compensation and Benefit Plans is a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement," as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA, or single employer plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063(a) of ERISA or a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(h)(iv) of the
American Disclosure Letter, the IRS has issued a favorable determination
letter in respect of each of the American Compensation and Benefit Plans that
is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
and neither American nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such letter.
Each of the American Compensation and Benefit Plans that is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 125 or 501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies
such requirements, except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an American Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the American Compensation and Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and applicable Laws, including but
not limited to ERISA and the Code, except as would not, either individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an American Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(v) As of the date of this Agreement no participants are accruing or will
accrue any benefits for service after the date hereof, other than accruing
service for purposes of vesting into retirement benefits accrued prior to the
date hereof, and eligibility for early retirement subsidies on benefits
accrued prior to the date hereof, under any American Compensation and Benefit
Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA (an " _ _American DB Plan__ ").
Each participant in an American DB Plan was provided notice in a timely manner
under Section 204(h) of ERISA regarding the cessation of benefit accruals
under the American DB Plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(h)(v) of the
American Disclosure Letter, the plan assets of each American DB Plan equals or
exceeds the benefit liabilities of such American DB Plan assuming each
American DB Plan was terminated in a standard termination under Section 4041
of ERISA as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section
3.1(h)(v) of the American Disclosure Letter, neither American nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any outstanding liability for any minimum required
contributions under Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or Sections 302 and 303 of
ERISA or any premiums due but unpaid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(h)(v) of the American

(other than routine claims for benefits) against any American Compensation and
Benefit Plan, the assets of any American Compensation and Benefit Plan or
against American or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any American
Compensation and Benefit Plan. Except in

 



18  connection with the Cases, there is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any court, governmental body, commission, agency or arbitrator
outstanding against or in favor of any American Compensation and Benefit Plan
or any fiduciary thereof (other than rules of general applicability). There
are no pending or, to Americans Knowledge, threatened audits or
investigations by any governmental body, commission or agency involving any
American Compensation and Benefit Plan, that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an American Material Adverse Effect.

 

(vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(h)(vii) of the American Disclosure
Letter, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement shall not, by
themselves or in coordination with any other event or condition, result in (A)
any increase in the amount of any payment to any current or former employee,
consultant or director of American or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B)
accelerate the vesting, time of payment or funding of any compensation or
benefits, or right to any compensation or benefits, of any current or former
employee, consultant or director of American or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(viii) With respect to each American Compensation and Benefit Plan that
primarily provides benefits or compensation to non-U.S. employees and is
maintained subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States (the " _ _American Foreign Plans__ "): (A) such American Foreign Plan
complies in all material respects in form and operation in accordance with
all applicable Laws; (B) except as could not reasonably be expected to result
in a material liability, if an American Foreign Plan is intended to qualify
for special Tax treatment, such plan meets all requirements for such
treatment; (C) if required under applicable Laws to be funded and/or book-
reserved, such American Foreign Plan is funded and/or book reserved, as
appropriate, to the extent so required by applicable Laws; and (D) there are

liabilities, solvency deficiencies or contribution holidays with respect to
any of the American Foreign Plans.

 

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_.

 

(i) The businesses of each of American and its Subsidiaries have not been
conducted in violation of any material federal, state, local or foreign law,
statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement,
license or permit, of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _ _Laws__ ")
or any applicable operating certificates, common carrier obligations,
airworthiness directives (" _ _ADs__ "), Federal Aviation Regulations (" _
_FARs__ ") or any other rules, regulations, directives or policies of the
FAA, DOT, FCC, DHS or any other Governmental Entity, except for such
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in an American Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth in Section 3.1(i)(i) of the American Disclosure Letter, no investigation
or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to American or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to Americans Knowledge, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for any
such investigations or reviews that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an American Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set

 



19  forth in Section 3.1(i)(i) of the American Disclosure Letter, each of
American and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in substantial compliance
with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations,

required, issued or granted by the FAA, DOT or any other Governmental Entity
applicable to it (" _ _Licenses__ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except for any failures to have or to be in compliance
with such Licenses which would not, individually or in the aggregate,

regulations of the Governmental Entity issuing such Licenses, except in each

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an American Material
Adverse Effect. There is not pending or, to Americans Knowledge, threatened
before the FAA, DOT or any other Governmental Entity any material proceeding,
notice of violation, order of forfeiture or complaint or investigation against
American or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any of the Licenses, except
for any of the foregoing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an American Material Adverse Effect. The
actions of the applicable Governmental Entities granting all Licenses
have not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, annulled or suspended, and there is
not pending or, to Americans Knowledge, threatened, any material application,
petition, objection or other pleading with the FAA, DOT or any other
Governmental Entity which challenges or questions the validity of or any
rights of the holder under any License, except as set forth in Section
3.1(i)(ii) of the American Disclosure Letter and except, for any of the
foregoing, that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in an American Material Adverse Effect.

that is a Binding American Contract is a valid and binding agreement of
American or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and is, or will be,
in full force and effect, except to the extent it has previously expired in
accordance with its terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an American Material Adverse Effect. Neither American nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default or breach under the terms of any American Material
Contract that is a Binding American Contract, which default or breach would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an
American Material Adverse Effect.

(k) _Real Property_.

$25,000,000 per annum (collectively, the " _ _American Leased Real Property__
" and, together with American Owned Real Property, the " _ _American Real
Property__ "). True and complete copies of all Contracts (other than
Contracts rejected in connection with the Cases as of the date of this
Agreement) pertaining to the American Leased Real Property (each, an " _
_American Lease__ ") have been made available to US Airways prior to the date
hereof. With respect to American Leased Real Property and each American Lease

good faith by appropriate proceedings; and (E) other encumbrances that do not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the continued use,

Real Property or American Leased Real Property to which they relate or the
conduct of the business of American and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted.

involving any US Airways Compensation and Benefit Plan, that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a US Airways
Material Adverse Effect.

(vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(h)(vii) of the US Airways Disclosure

or any applicable operating certificates, common carrier obligations, ADs,
FARs or any other rules, regulations, directives or policies of the FAA, DOT,
FCC, DHS or any other Governmental Entity, except for such violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a US Airways Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
3.2(i)(i) of the US Airways Disclosure Letter, no investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to US Airways or any of its Subsidiaries

Knowledge, threatened before the FAA, DOT or any other Governmental Entity any
material proceeding, notice of violation, order of forfeiture or complaint
or investigation against US Airways or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
any of the Licenses, except for any of the foregoing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a US
Airways Material Adverse Effect. The actions of the applicable Governmental
Entities granting all Licenses have not been reversed, stayed, enjoined,
annulled or suspended, and there is not pending or, to US Airways Knowledge,
threatened, any material application, 

 



41  petition, objection or other pleading with the FAA, DOT or any other
Governmental Entity which challenges or questions the validity of or any

Material Adverse Effect.

inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to (1) any
merger, consolidation or similar transaction (other than the Merger) pursuant
to which any third Person or group of Persons party thereto, or
the stockholders of such third Person or Persons, would become the beneficial
owner of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or the

 



61  outstanding voting power of American, American Airlines, Inc., AMR Eagle
Holding Corporation or American Eagle Airlines, Inc. (as reorganized pursuant
to the Bankruptcy Code or prior to such reorganization if acquired to
influence acceptance or rejection of the Plan, the management or control of
American and its Subsidiaries or the reorganization of the Debtors), or, if
applicable, any surviving entity or the parent entity resulting from any such
transaction, immediately upon consummation thereof, (2) any purchase of 10% or

any of the officers and directors of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall,

of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to take, any action described in

described in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as an " _ _American
Change in Recommendation__ ").

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.3(a), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent American or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives, or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof from:

(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law
(including under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act) with regard to
an

 



62  American Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to
be an American Change in Recommendation unless the American Board of Directors
publicly reaffirms the American Directors Recommendation in such disclosure;

by the Bankruptcy Court:

Creditors Committee in the Cases (the " _ _UCC s Advisors__") shall have
the right to participate in any such discussions and negotiations to the same
extent permitted under the Joint Exploration Protocol Agreement, dated May 1,
2012, as amended, and the Joint Exploration Protocol Side Letter Agreement,
dated July 19, 2012, as amended, between American and the Creditors
Committee (to the extent such agreements are then in effect)); or

(C) making an American Change in Recommendation ( _provided_ , that prior to
making any such American Change in Recommendation, American shall have
consulted with the UCCs Advisors);

 

 _provided_ , that (w) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B)
above, (1) American has not breached its obligations under this Section
4.3(a) in connection with the receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written

of such American Acquisition Proposal, a failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stakeholders of the Debtors under applicable Law; (x) in the case referred to
in clause (C) above, if such American Change in Recommendation does not relate
to an American Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of American
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,

Acquisition Proposal, (2) the Board of Directors of American determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel,

American Acquisition Proposal is the highest or otherwise best offer available
to the stakeholders of the Debtors (to whom fiduciary duties are owed by the
Board of Directors of American) as compared to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Plan and (3) the Board of Directors of American
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that a failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stakeholders of the Debtors under applicable
Law, taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.3(c); and (z) in the
case referred to in clause (C) above, US Airways shall have had written notice
of Americans intention to take the action referred to in clause (C) (a " _

days prior to the taking of such action by American and American shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 4.3(c);

 

 _provided_ , _further_ , that any American Acquisition Proposal referred to
in clause (y) above must involve (A) a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction pursuant to which any Person or the stockholders of such Person
would become the beneficial owners of at least 30% of the outstanding shares
of common stock or the outstanding voting power of American or American

this Agreement as an " _ _American Superior Proposal__ ").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a Standalone Plan or any plan
of reorganization that is substantially equivalent to a Standalone Plan be
deemed an American Superior Proposal.

 

(b) American agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person other
than US Airways with respect to any American Acquisition Proposal. American
will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an American
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of
such Person by or on behalf of American or any of its Subsidiaries. American
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3. American
agrees that

 



64  any action inconsistent with the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.3
taken by any Representative of American or any of its Subsidiaries will be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.3 by American (and any willful action
or failure to take an action by any of Americans Subsidiaries or any of
Americans or its Subsidiaries respective Representatives at the direction or
request of, or with the consent or approval of, American and with the actual
knowledge of an officer of American (who is a knowledge party within the
meaning of "Americans Knowledge") that the action so taken or omitted to be
taken would constitute a material breach of this Section 4.3 will be deemed
to be a Deliberate Material Breach of this Section 4.3 by American).

(c) American agrees that it will notify US Airways (and the UCCs Legal

information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall
keep US Airways (and the UCCs Advisors) informed, on a current basis, on the
status and terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. American agrees that (i) during the five (5)
business day period following a Notice of American Change in Recommendation
and prior to making an American Change in Recommendation, if requested by US
Airways, American and its Representatives (in consultation with the UCCs
Advisors) shall negotiate in good faith with US Airways and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by US Airways and (ii) American may
make an American Change in Recommendation only if the facts and circumstances
that are the basis for such American Change in Recommendation continue to
necessitate an American Change in Recommendation in light of any revisions to
the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to which US
Airways shall have agreed in writing prior to the expiration of such five (5)
business day period. American agrees that it will deliver to US Airways (and
the UCCs Legal Advisor) a new Notice of American Change in Recommendation

materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to recommend or
agreeing to recommend such American Acquisition Proposal to the stakeholders
of the Debtors and that a new five (5) business day period shall commence, for
purposes of this Section 4.3(c), with respect to each such materially revised
or modified American Acquisition Proposal from the time US Airways receives a
Notice of American Change in Recommendation with respect thereto. American
also agrees to provide any information to US Airways (and the UCCs Advisors)
that it is providing to another Person pursuant to this Section 4.3 prior to
or substantially contemporaneous with the time it provides it to such other
Person unless American has already provided such information to US Airways or
it is advised by outside legal counsel that doing so would violate applicable
Law.

(d) Subject to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
American agrees that its obligations pursuant to Sections 4.7(a) and 4.20
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication

Acquisition Proposal, by any consideration of or agreement with respect to an
American Acquisition Proposal or by any change or proposed change to the
American Directors Recommendation (whether or not permitted by the terms of
this Agreement).

66 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.4(a), nothing

thereof from:

(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law (including
under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act) with regard to a US
Airways Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than
a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be US
Airways Change in Recommendation unless the US Airways Board of Directors
publicly reaffirms the US Airways Directors Recommendation in such
disclosure;

(ii) at any time prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval:

(A) providing information in response to a request therefor by the Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written US Airways Acquisition Proposal;

(B) engaging in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written US Airways Acquisition Proposal; or

_provided_ that, (w) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above,
(1) US Airways has not breached its obligations under this Section 4.4(a) in
connection with the receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written US Airways
Acquisition Proposal, (2) US Airways receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement (excluding standstill provisions) containing
customary terms that are no less favorable in any material respect to US
Airways than those contained in the American NDA, (3) the Board of Directors
of US Airways reasonably determines that such US Airways Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a US Airways Superior Proposal
(without having to take the actions referred to in clause (z) below) and (4)
the Board of Directors of US Airways reasonably determines, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such US Airways Acquisition
Proposal, a failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of US Airways under
applicable Law; (x) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, if such US
Airways Change in Recommendation does not relate to a US Airways Acquisition
Proposal, the Board of Directors of US Airways determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of US Airways under applicable Law, taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4.4(c); (y) in the case referred to in clause (C) above,

more favorable, from a financial point of view, to US Airways stockholders
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (3) the Board of
Directors of US Airways determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such action is reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of US
Airways under applicable Law, taking into account any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.4(c);
and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, American shall have had

common stock or the outstanding voting power of US Airways or US Airways,
Inc., or, if applicable, any surviving entity (if neither US Airways or US
Airways, Inc. is the surviving entity) resulting from any such transaction,

Section 4.4 by US Airways (and any willful action or failure to take an action
by any of US Airways Subsidiaries or any of US Airways or its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives at the direction or request of, or with the consent

Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by American and (ii) US Airways may
make a US Airways Change in Recommendation only if the facts and circumstances
that are the basis for such US Airways Change in Recommendation continue to

business day period. US Airways agrees that it will deliver to American a new
Notice of US Airways Change in Recommendation with respect to each US Airways

71  or on behalf of American, US Airways or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

other communications received by American or US Airways, as the case may be,
or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. American shall give prompt notice to US Airways of
any change, fact or condition which, to Americans Knowledge, is reasonably
expected to result in an American Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of
any condition to US Airways obligations to effect the Merger. US Airways
shall give prompt notice to American of any change, fact or condition which,
to US Airways Knowledge, is reasonably expected to result in a US Airways
Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Americans

any notice pursuant to this Section 4.7(d) will not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the

include the obligation to cooperate with each other and use (and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to

Governmental Entity reversed on appeal or vacated. For purposes of this
Section 4.7, " _ _reasonable best efforts__ " shall include each of
Americans and US Airways agreement to, (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of its assets or the assets of its Subsidiaries or conduct its
business in a specified manner or (ii) permit its assets or the assets of its

in this Agreement will require, or be deemed to require, American or US
Airways to agree to or effect any divestiture or take any other action (x) if
doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Newco Material Adverse Effect, (y) if any such sale, holding
separate or other disposition of assets or conduct of business in a specified
manner would be required to be effected prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time or (z) in the case of American, that is not permitted by the
Bankruptcy Court; provided that American has used its reasonable best efforts
to, and taken all action reasonably necessary to, promptly obtain permission
to take such action from the Bankruptcy Court. " _ _Newco Material Adverse
Effect__ " means a material adverse effect on the financial condition, assets,
liabilities, business, prospects, consolidated business plan or results of
operations of Newco and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

 



72 (f) Each party shall give the other party the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against such party
and/or its directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this paragraph, "participate"

strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the litigation by the
litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client privilege between the
litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected),
and the non-litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to
the litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power or other
authority over the litigation of any settlement thereof.

period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to) furnish promptly to the other party and its authorized
Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested (subject to applicable
confidentiality restrictions and provided that neither party shall be required
to furnish any information that would be materially harmful to such partys
competitive position) and (b) such partys and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to discuss any information furnished by or on behalf of such
party and to discuss such partys and its Subsidiaries businesses, affairs,

into effect (i) prior to the Closing, the Ordinary Course Changes as defined
in and set forth in Section 4.1(o) of the American Disclosure Letter and (ii)
promptly after the Merger Support Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court,
the Employee Protection Arrangements as defined in and set forth in Section
4.1(o) of the American Disclosure Letter (including but not limited to
granting under the Newco 2013 Incentive Award Plan, the alignment equity and
long term incentive awards in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions
set forth in Section 4.1(o) of the American Disclosure Letter, which awards
shall be effective as of the Effective Time).

(e) Each employee of US Airways, American or any of their respective
Subsidiaries as of the Closing (including any employee who is full-time, part-
time, temporary, on vacation or on a medical or disability or any other paid
or unpaid approved leave of absence) who continues employment with Newco or
the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (each, a " _ _Continuing
Employee__ ") who is not represented by a labor union and/or whose employment
is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement (collectively, the " _
_Non-Union Continuing Employees__ ") shall continue to receive, during the one
(1)-year period beginning on the Closing Date, base salary or wages that are
no less favorable than the base salary or wages received by such Non-Union
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. During the two
(2)-year period beginning on the Closing Date, each Non-Union Continuing
Employee shall be entitled to receive severance pay and benefits that are not
less favorable than the severance pay and benefits such Non-Union Continuing
Employee would have received under the applicable American Compensation and
Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, including as
amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 4.1(o) of the American
Disclosure Letter, or any US Airways Compensation and Benefit Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, including as amended or supplemented
in accordance with Section 4.2(o) of the US Airways Disclosure Letter. The
employment terms and conditions of each Continuing Employee who is not a Non-

 



74  Union Continuing Employee shall be governed by the applicable labor union
agreement and/or collective bargaining agreement.

 

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Newco shall credit, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to credit, each Non-
Union Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with US Airways,
American, or any of their respective Subsidiaries and predecessor entities,
under any employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which such
Non-Union Continuing Employee participates following the Closing (the " _
_Post-Closing Plans__ "), to the same extent as such Non-Union Continuing
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for
such service under any similar US Airways Compensation and Benefit Plan or
American Compensation and Benefit Plan, for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and, to the extent applicable, calculation of the amount of vacation, travel
and/or severance benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no service prior to
the Closing Date shall be credited for the purpose of benefit accrual or
eligibility for any defined benefit pension plan, early retirement benefits or
subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan, nor for purposes of
eligibility under any retiree medical plan, except to the extent required by
applicable Laws (and then only to the extent crediting such service would not
result in the duplication of benefits).

 

(g) In addition, and without limiting the generality of Section 4.10(f), this
Section 4.10(g) or any other provisions herein, (i) for purposes of each
Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or
other health benefits to any Non-Union Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, Newco shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Non-Union
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such
pre-existing condition exclusions or actively-at-work requirements were waived
or were inapplicable under the comparable US Airways Compensation and Benefit
Plan or American Compensation and Benefit Plan and (ii) the Post-Closing
Plans shall not deny Non-Union Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of
pre-existing conditions and shall credit such Non-Union Continuing Employees
for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of
initial participation in the Post-Closing Plans.

(h) On the date the employment of any Non-Union Continuing Employee is
transferred to Newco or a different Subsidiary of Newco, the accrued and
unused vacation and any positive account balance under any medical or
dependent care expense reimbursement account of such Non-Union Continuing
Employee shall be transferred to such new employer, and such new employer
shall be responsible for such obligations at or after the date of such
transfer, except in the case of a transfer of such expense reimbursement
account balances to a new employer that does not maintain any dependent care
or medical expense reimbursement account plan. Each Non-Union Continuing
Employee also shall be permitted to continue to have payroll deductions made
as most recently elected by him or her under the applicable FSA Plan.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.10(e) to the contrary, Newco shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, explicitly

 



75  assume and hereby agree to perform, or to cause to be performed, the
obligations of US Airways or its Subsidiaries under those plans and agreements
set forth on Section 4.10(i) of the US Airways Disclosure Letter (which
provide severance payments and/or benefits applicable to Non-Union Continuing
Employees).

(j) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Non-Union
Continuing Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of a US Airways
Compensation and Benefit Plan or an American Compensation and Benefit Plan
that is a 401(k) plan shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Newco or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing (each,
a " _ _Post-Closing 401(k) Plan__ ") and shall be credited with eligibility
service and vesting service for all periods of service with US Airways and
American, and their respective Subsidiaries to the extent so credited with
such service under the applicable 401(k) plan as of the Closing
Date. Additionally, in the event Newco or any of its Subsidiaries terminates
a 401(k) plan after the Closing Date, each Non-Union Continuing Employee who
participates in such plan shall, following such termination, become eligible
to participate in a Post-Closing 401(k) Plan for purposes of making rollover
contributions and, at his or her election, be entitled to roll over his or her
outstanding participant loan and related promissory note under the terminated
401(k) plan. During the period commencing on the date of such termination and
ending at the time of the rollover of such loan and related promissory notes
and related account balances, such loans shall continue to be maintained under
the applicable 401(k) plan, and Newco shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, make payroll deductions in respect of required payments under
any such loan and timely remit such amounts to the applicable 401(k) plan as
payments on such loan. During such period, provided that the participant
continues to make all required installment payments with respect to such loan,
such loan shall not be placed in default, and Newco (or the Surviving
Corporation) and the US Airways or one of its Subsidiaries shall take all
necessary action to cause such loan not to be placed in default.

(k) Except as otherwise required under applicable Laws or to the extent
expressly set forth in a binding written agreement with Newco, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Non-Union Continuing
Employees shall be considered to be employed "at will" and nothing shall be
construed to limit the ability of Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any such employee
at any time, subject to any applicable severance and related benefits
(including any governmental or statutory severance).

(l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Continuing Employee
who is located in a jurisdiction where local employment Laws provide for an
automatic transfer of employees upon transfer of a business as a going concern
and such transfer occurs by operation of Law (the " _ _Automatic
Transferred Employees__ "), in the event that the applicable Laws of any
country require Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) to maintain Terms and Conditions of Employment with respect to any
Automatic Transferred Employee following the Closing or (ii) to continue or
cause to be continued any employment contract of any Automatic Transferred
Employee, Newco shall cause the entity that employs such Automatic Transferred
Employee following the Closing to comply with such requirements to the extent
required

 



76  by such applicable Laws; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
4.10(l) shall prevent Newco or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the
employment of any Automatic Transferred Employee after the Closing (for which
Newco and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any costs or liabilities)
or otherwise modifying the Terms and Conditions of Employment of any Automatic
Transferred Employee to the extent permitted by Law or otherwise agreed with
applicable employee(s) or representative(s) thereof. " _ _Terms and Conditions
of Employment__ " shall mean the rights of Automatic Transferred Employees
according to their individual terms and conditions of employment with US
Airways or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing and, where
applicable, under company or shop agreements, and any arrangements based on
works customs and unilateral undertakings, if and to the extent they provide
to an Automatic Transferred Employee direct and enforceable causes of action
against the employer.

(m) Newco shall take, and may cause any of its Subsidiaries to take, any and
all actions necessary or appropriate (including to the extent necessary under
the plan) to, as of the Effective Time, (i) assume and adopt each US Airways
Compensation and Benefit Plan and each American Compensation and Benefit Plan
(including all matters set forth in this Section 4.10 and Section 4.1(o) of
the American Disclosure Letter, but excluding any prepetition equity or
equity-equivalent plan or agreement of American and its Subsidiaries) and to
maintain and to perform under such plans and agreements to the same extent as
US Airways or American or their respective subsidiaries would be required to
perform under such plans and agreements if the Merger did not take place, and
(ii) to the extent applicable, become, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
become, a "participating employer" (as applicable) under such US Airways
Compensation and Benefit Plans and American Compensation and Benefit Plans.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Newco shall assume, as of
the Effective Time, all of the American Compensation and Benefit Plans which
constitute retirement plans, including all such plans subject to Title IV
of ERISA and the supplemental employee retirement plan. US Airways shall
cooperate with American and Newco and shall take or cause to be taken any and
all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to effect the
provisions of this Section 4.10(m).

(n) This Agreement shall not be interpreted as an amendment to any American
Compensation and Benefit Plan or any US Airways Compensation and Benefit Plan
or any other compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to
directors, officers, employees or consultants of American, US Airways, Newco
or the Surviving Corporation prior to or following the Effective Time, and
nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with or limit Newcos or the
Surviving Corporations right to amend or terminate any individual plan,
program, policy or arrangement of US Airways or any of its Subsidiaries, and
nothing contained herein shall obligate Newco, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain or continue any individual
plan, program, policy or arrangement.

 

(o) It is expressly agreed that the provisions of this Section 4.10 are not
intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third
Person, including any employee of American or US Airways, or any collective
bargaining unit or employee organization. Without limiting the foregoing,
nothing contained in this 

 



77  Agreement shall create or imply any obligation on the part of US Airways,
American, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to provide any continuing employment right to any individual on
or after the Closing.

4.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that American and US Airways shall each be responsible for half of
the filing or similar fees incurred in connection with any filings required to
be made under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation and any other applicable
foreign antitrust, competition or similar Laws, as contemplated by Sections
3.1(d)(i)(B) and 3.2(d)(i)(B).

4.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Newco agrees that it will jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer of American
and its Subsidiaries and each director and officer of US Airways and its
Subsidiaries, in each case who was a director or officer at any time on or
after November 29, 2005 (in each case, for acts or failures to act in such
capacity) (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, and Newco shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination as to
whether a Person is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
hereunder shall be made by independent counsel selected by Newco and such
Person. 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
4.12(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Newco thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Newco of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially and actually
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Newco shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Newco shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Newco does not elect to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Newco and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Newco shall be obligated to pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as

 



78  statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Newco shall
be obligated pursuant to this Section 4.12(b) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will use their reasonable
efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Newco shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Newco shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed by American and US Airways, at or prior to the
Effective Time, American shall, and if American is unable to, Newco shall,
purchase the six-year "tail" officers and directors liability and fiduciary
insurance policies described in Section 4.12(c) of the American Disclosure
Letter (the " _ _Preferred American D andO Tail Policy__") or comparable
policies from other reputable insurance providers; _provided_ , that the
amount paid by American or Newco for such Preferred American DandO Tail Policy
shall not exceed 200% of the annual premium for Americans then current
officers and directors liability and fiduciary insurance policies (such
premium, the " _ _American Maximum Premium__ "). If the Preferred American
DandO Tail Policy has been obtained by American or Newco, Newco shall maintain
such policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder. If American or Newco are unable to obtain the
Preferred American DandO Tail Policy, Newco shall maintain officers and
directors liability insurance covering the same Persons covered or to be
covered by the Preferred American DandO Tail Policy (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby) issued by insurance carriers with the
same or higher financial strength ratings as, and on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than, those of the Preferred American
DandO Tail Policy, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Newco be required
to expend annually an amount in excess of the American Maximum Premium for
such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Newco shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a premium not exceeding the
American Maximum Premium.

(d) Unless otherwise agreed by American and US Airways, at or prior to the
Effective Time, US Airways shall, and if US Airways is unable to, Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the six-year "tail" officers and
directors liability and fiduciary insurance policies described in Section
4.12(d) of the US Airways Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Preferred US Airways D
andO Tail Policy__") or comparable policies from other reputable
insurance providers; _provided_ , that the amount paid by US Airways or the
Surviving Corporation for such Preferred US Airways DandO Tail Policy shall not
exceed 200% of the annual premium for US Airways then current officers
and directors liability and fiduciary insurance policies (such premium, the
" _ _US Airways Maximum Premium__ "). If the Preferred US Airways DandO Tail
Policy has been obtained 

 



79  by US Airways or the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in
full force and effect, for its full term, and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder. If US Airways or the Surviving Corporation
are unable to obtain the Preferred US Airways DandO Tail Policy, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain officers and directors liability insurance covering the same
Persons covered or to be covered by the Preferred US Airways DandO Tail Policy
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) issued by
insurance carriers with the same or higher financial strength ratings as, and
on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than, those of
the Preferred US Airways DandO Tail Policy, for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually an amount in excess
of the US Airways Maximum Premium for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_
, that if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a premium not exceeding the US Airways Maximum
Premium.

(e) In addition to the rights provided under Section 4.12(a), all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of American
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Contracts with American or such Subsidiaries
or US Airways and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Contracts with US Airways or
such Subsidiaries, their respective organizational documents or applicable Law
shall survive the Merger and shall be deemed assumed by Newco as of the
Effective Time and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Newco shall honor and perform
under all indemnification Contracts and organizational documents of American
and its Subsidiaries and US Airways and its Subsidiaries. Newco shall not,
directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate, in any manner
adverse to the current or former directors or officers of American and its
Subsidiaries or US Airways and its Subsidiaries, with respect to their
respective rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
any such Contracts with American or its Subsidiaries or US Airways or its
Subsidiaries, or any such provisions contained in any of their respective
organizational documents.

(f) The obligations of Newco and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
4.12 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party or other Person to whom this Section
4.12 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other
Person. If Newco or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Newco or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.12.

 



80 (g) From and after the Effective Time, Newco shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, provide: (i) positive space, first class flight
privileges to each Person (and such Persons spouse, life partner and
dependent children) who as of the date of this Agreement is a non-employee
member of the Board of Directors of American or US Airways for personal non-
business related travel on substantially the same terms as such flight
privileges are provided as of the date of this Agreement to the fully vested
members of the Board of Directors of US Airways, and such flight privileges
shall continue until the later of the death of such Person or such Persons
spouse or life partner, (ii) to each Person who as of the date of this
Agreement is a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of American or
US Airways, participation in Newcos flight benefit program for directors, as
the same may be amended or modified from time to time, with the exception that
only Persons then serving as members of the Board of Directors of Newco shall
be entitled to a tax gross-up with respect to their flight privileges or any
flight benefit plan benefits, and (iii) flight privileges to each Person (and
such Persons spouse, life partner and dependent children) who as of the
date of this Agreement is a former member of the Board of Directors of
American or US Airways on substantially the same terms as such flight
privileges are provided to such Person as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this Section 4.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and the other
Persons contemplated by Section 4.12(e) and Section 4.12(g) and their heirs
and legal representatives.

4.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
American and US Airways and their respective Board of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and by the Merger and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

4.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in Section 2.2(b), each of
American, US Airways and Merger Sub shall pay any sales, use, ad valorem,
property, transfer (including real property transfer) and similar Taxes
imposed on such Person as a result of or in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (any such Taxes, " _ _Transfer
Taxes__ "), except to the extent such Transfer Taxes may not be assessed
pursuant to section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the parties
shall cooperate in good faith to prepare and timely deliver any certificate
or instrument necessary for a party hereto to claim a bulk sale or other
exemption from Transfer Taxes otherwise payable.

 

4.15 _Taxation_.

(a) The parties intend that the Merger in conjunction with the Plan will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and shall use their reasonable best efforts (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts) to cause the Merger
(together with the Plan) to so qualify. Neither American nor US Airways shall
take, cause or permit to be taken, or fail to take, 

 



81  any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, which action or
failure to act would disqualify the Merger (together with the Plan) as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Each of American, US Airways and Merger Sub shall cooperate with
each other in obtaining opinions of Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to US
Airways, and Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, counsel to American and Merger Sub,
to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 5.2(d) and 5.3(d). US Airways
and American (on its behalf and on behalf of Merger Sub) shall execute and
deliver to each of Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to US Airways, and Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP, counsel to American and Merger Sub, certificates
substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits E and F at such time
or times as reasonably requested by each such law firm in connection with its
delivery of the opinion referred to in Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.3(d), as
the case may be. Prior to the Effective Time, none of American, US Airways or
Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be
untrue any of the representations in such certificates. The parties will take
the position for all Tax purposes that the Merger (together with the Plan)
qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, unless a contrary position is required by a final determination within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

 

(c) The parties intend that the "ownership change" of American within the
meaning of Section 382 of the Code resulting from the consummation of the
Merger and the implementation of the Plan qualify for relief under Section
382(l)(5) of the Code, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to so
qualify. Accordingly, the parties shall utilize the procedures in that
certain Bankruptcy Court order establishing notification procedures for
substantial claimholders, dated January 27, 2012, as amended or revised prior
to or, with the reasonable approval of US Airways, after the date hereof (the
" _ _Notification Procedures Order__ "), to obtain Notices of Substantial
Claimholder Status (as defined in the Notification Procedures Order) and, if
the parties so determine in accordance with such Notification
Procedures Order, to seek Bankruptcy Court approval of appropriate Sell Down
Notices (as defined in the Notification Procedures Order). In furtherance of
the foregoing and to protect against multiple "ownership changes" of US
Airways, US Airways shall adopt, effective upon the execution of this
Agreement, a rights plan, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
American, to minimize the likelihood that any additional Persons or group of
Persons acting together become "5% shareholders" of US Airways within the
meaning of Section 382 of the Code and that any existing such "5%
shareholders" increase their ownership, other than pursuant to the Plan.

 

4.16 _Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing_. American shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Newco Common Stock to be
authorized for listing on the NYSE or NASDAQ upon official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date, and American shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have Newcos trading symbol reflect the American Airlines brand after the
Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the shares of US Airways
Common Stock to be no longer listed on the NYSE or the principal securities
market on which the shares of US Airways Common Stock are then listed or
quoted and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 



82 4.17 _Reservation of Newco Common Stock_. Effective at such time as the Newco
Charter shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware pursuant to Section 1.6(a), Newco shall reserve (free from
preemptive rights) out of its authorized but unissued or treasury shares of
Newco Common Stock, sufficient shares of Newco Common Stock to effect the
issuance of shares of Newco Common Stock under Section 2.1 and upon the
exercise of Converted US Airways Options and Converted US Airways Equity
Awards or the conversion of the Converted US Airways 7.25% Convertible Notes
and Converted US Airways 7% Convertible Notes.

4.18 _Transition Planning_. In order to facilitate the integration of the
operations of American and US Airways and their respective Subsidiaries and to
permit the coordination of their related operations on a timely basis, and in
an effort to accelerate to the earliest time practicable following the
Effective Time the realization of synergies, operating efficiencies and other
benefits expected to be realized by the parties as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,
American and US Airways shall establish a committee (the " _ _Transition
Committee__ ") to be managed by the chief executive officers of each of
American and US Airways and with such other members as they shall mutually
agree, which Transition Committee shall have responsibility for coordinating
and directing the efforts of the parties with respect to (a) the integration
of operations and fleet plan of American and US Airways and their respective
Subsidiaries, (b) obtaining the required consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities as contemplated by Section 4.7, (c) communications,
public relations and investor relations strategy and approach of the parties
regarding the Plan, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(other than any partys actions in respect of an American Acquisition Proposal
or a US Airways Acquisition Proposal, respectively) and (d) other business and
operational matters, including the financing needs of Newco and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, to the extent not in violation of
applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and
other laws regarding competition. The Creditors Committee shall have the
right to have up to two designees from the UCCs Advisors attend meetings of
the Transition Committee.

4.19  _Section 16(b)_. American and US Airways shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other dispositions of shares of US Airways Common Stock or acquisitions of
Newco Common Stock in connection with this Agreement by each individual who
is a director or officer of US Airways to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

4.20 _Approval of Plan; Confirmation Order_.

(a) _Plan and Disclosure Statement_. Unless otherwise consented to in writing
by US Airways (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), American (in consultation with the UCCs Advisors) shall and shall
cause each of the other Debtors to:

(i) (A) by the date that is the seventh (7th) business day following the
execution of this Agreement, file a motion (the " _ _Merger Support Motion__
") with the Bankruptcy Court, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
American, US Airways and the UCCs Advisors, seeking approval pursuant to an
order of the 

 



83  Bankruptcy Court in form and substance reasonably acceptable to American and
US Airways (the " _ _Merger Support Order__ ") of (1) this Agreement and (2)
the execution and delivery hereof by American and the performance by American
of all of its obligations hereunder (which Merger Support Order shall include
authorization and approval of the matters set forth in Section 4.10 and
Section 4.1(o) of the American Disclosure Schedule); (B) use reasonable best
efforts to include in the Merger Support Order a provision ordering (1) a
waiver of Bankruptcy Rule 6004(h) and (2) that the Merger Support Order be

American Disclosure Letter, the US Airways Disclosure Letter, the Amended and
Restated Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
between US Airways and American, relating to the information to be provided by
American to US Airways (the " _ _US Airways NDA__ ") and the Amended and
Restated Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
between US Airways and American, relating to the information to be provided by
US Airways to American (the " _ _American NDA__ " and together with the US
Airways NDA, as they may be amended, amended and restated, modified or
provisions thereof waived,

 



105   the " _ _Non-Disclosure Agreements__ ") constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

7.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 4.12
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies whatsoever; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the
Creditors Committee is explicitly named as a third party beneficiary solely
as to the provisions of this Agreement expressly granted to the Creditors
Committee or the UCCs Advisors hereunder, with the right to enforce such
provisions subject to the terms hereof.

7.10 _Obligations of American and of US Airways_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of American to take any action, such requirement shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of American to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.
Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of US Airways to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of US Airways to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

7.11 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

7.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

7.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to a Section of, or Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The term "made available" and words of similar import means that
the relevant documents, instruments or materials were either (A) posted and
made available to the other party or its designated Representatives on the
Intralinks due diligence data site, with respect to American, or on the RR
Donnelley due diligence data site, with respect to US Airways, as applicable,
maintained by either

 



106   company for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (B) publicly available by virtue of the relevant partys filing of a
publicly available final registration statement, prospectus, report, form,
schedule or definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each case, prior to the date such
documents, instruments or materials were represented by a party to have been
made available to the other party.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each of American and US Airways has or may have set forth information in
its respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of
the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of the
disclosure letter or section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the face
of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the Person to which
such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.
Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "American Material Adverse
Effect," "US Airways Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement.

(d) The phrase "ordinary course of business" and words of similar import
shall mean, when used with respect to American or its Subsidiaries, the
ordinary course of business of American or its Subsidiaries as conducted prior
to the commencement of the Cases (it being understood that the fact that the
Debtors may seek Bankruptcy Court approval of any matter shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a determination that such matter is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement).

 

7.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be
void ab initio.

7.15 _Specific Performance_. American, US Airways and Merger Sub agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto
fail to perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their
specified terms or to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise breach such provisions. American, US Airways and Merger Sub agree
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including
specific performance in connection with enforcing a partys obligation
to consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Each of American, US Airways and

 



107   Merger Sub agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief consistent with this Section
7.15 on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law. A
party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 7.15 shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

_DGCL_ ").

 

ARTICLE IV

 

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

SECTION 1. _Authorized Capital Stock_.

(a) The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,850,000,000 shares of capital stock,
consisting of 1,750,000,000 shares of common stock having a par value of $0.01
per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock
having a par value of $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

(b) The number of authorized shares of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, irrespective
of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision
thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred
Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.

SECTION 2. _Common Stock_. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have
such rights as are set forth in the DGCL and, to the extent consistent
therewith, such rights as are set forth below:

shall be entitled to cast one vote in person or by proxy for each share of
Common Stock standing in such holders name on the stock transfer records of
the Corporation with respect to any and all matters presented to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at each
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. There shall be no cumulative
voting. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing Directors, the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Common Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereon shall constitute a
quorum of the Common Stock for the purpose of electing Directors by holders
of the Common Stock.

(b) _Dividends_. Subject to any other provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation and the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock,
holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends
and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation when, as
and if declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time in
respect of the Common Stock out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor.

 



2 (c) _Liquidation, Dissolution, etc._ In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up (either voluntary or involuntary) of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution
after payments to creditors in proportion to the number of shares held by
them, after payment of any preferential and other amounts, if any, to which
any holders of Preferred Stock may be entitled.

(d) _Merger, etc._ In the event of a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into another entity (whether or not the Corporation is the
surviving entity), the holders of each share of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive the same per share consideration on a per share basis.

(e) _No Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to preemptive rights.

SECTION 3. _Preferred Stock_.

(a) _Issuance of Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors is expressly
authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the issuance of
shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, with such voting powers, full
or limited, or without voting powers and with such designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue thereof
adopted by the Board of Directors, including (but without limiting
the generality thereof) the following:

(i) The designation of such series and the number of shares
authorized thereunder;

(ii) The dividend rate of such series, the conditions and dates upon which
such dividends shall be payable, the relation which such dividends shall bear
to the dividends payable on any other class or classes of stock, and whether
such dividend shall be cumulative or non-cumulative;

 

(iii) Whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption by the
Corporation and, if made subject to such redemption, the times, prices and
other terms and conditions of such redemption;

(iv) The terms and amount of any sinking fund provided for the purpose or
redemption of the shares of such series;

(v) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of any other class or classes or of any other series
of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, and, if provision be made
for conversion or exchange, the times, prices, rates, adjustments, and other
terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;

 



3 (vi) The extent, if any, to which the holders of the shares of such
series shall be entitled to vote with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise;

(vii) The restrictions, if any, on the issue or reissue of any additional
Preferred Stock; and

(viii) The rights of the holders of the shares of such series upon the
dissolution of, or upon the distribution of assets of, the Corporation.

(b) _No Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to preemptive rights.

SECTION 4. _Power to Sell and Purchase Shares_. Subject to the requirements
of applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to issue and sell all
or any part of any shares of any class or series of stock herein or hereafter
authorized to such persons, and for such consideration, as the Board of
Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion, determine, whether or
not greater consideration could be received upon the issue or sale of the same
number of shares of another class or series, and as otherwise permitted by
law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall have
the power to purchase any shares of any class or series of stock herein or
hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration, as the
Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion, determine,
whether or not less consideration could be paid upon the purchase of the same
number of shares of another class or series, and as otherwise permitted by
law.

 

SECTION 5. _Non-Citizen Voting and Ownership Limitations_. All (x) capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, the Corporation, (y) securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests in the Corporation, or (z) options,
warrants or other rights to acquire the securities described in clauses (x)
and (y), whether fixed or contingent, matured or unmatured, contractual,
legal, equitable or otherwise (collectively, " _Equity Securities_ ") shall be
subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) _Non-Citizen Voting and Ownership Limitations_. In no event shall
individuals or entities who fail to qualify as a "citizen of the United
States," as the term is defined in Section 40102(a)(15) of Subtitle VII of
Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended, in any similar legislation of
the United States enacted in substitution or replacement therefor, and as
interpreted by the Department of Transportation, its predecessors and
successors, from time to time (a " _Non-Citizen_ "), be entitled to own
(beneficially or of record) or have voting control over more than (x) 24.9% of
the aggregate votes of all outstanding Equity Securities of the Corporation
(the " _Voting Cap Amount_ ") or (y) 49.9% of the total number of outstanding
shares of Equity Securities of the Corporation (" _the Absolute Cap Amount_ "
and together with the Voting Cap Amount, the " _Cap Amounts_ ").

(b) _Enforcement of Cap Amounts_. The restrictions imposed by the Cap Amounts
shall be applied to each Non-Citizen in reverse chronological order based upon
the date of registration (or attempted registration in the case of the
Absolute Cap Amount) on the separate stock record maintained by the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the registration of Equity Securities
held by Non-Citizens (the " _Foreign Stock Record_ ") or the stock transfer
records of the 

 



4  Corporation. At no time shall the shares of Equity Securities held by Non-
Citizens be voted, unless such shares are registered on the Foreign Stock
Record. In the event that Non-Citizens shall own (beneficially or of record)
or have voting control over any Equity Securities, the voting rights of such
persons shall be subject to automatic suspension to the extent required to
ensure that the Corporation is in compliance with applicable provisions of
law and regulations relating to ownership or control of a United States air
carrier. In the event that any transfer of Equity Securities to a Non-Citizen
would result in Non-Citizens owning (beneficially or of record) more than
the Absolute Cap Amount, such transfer shall be void and of no effect and
shall not be recorded in the books and records of the Corporation. The Bylaws
shall contain provisions to implement this Section 5, including, without
limitation, provisions restricting or prohibiting the transfer of Equity
Securities to Non-Citizens and provisions restricting or removing voting
rights as to shares of Equity Securities owned or controlled by Non-Citizens.
Any determination as to ownership, control or citizenship made by the Board
of Directors shall be conclusive and binding as between the Corporation and
any stockholder.

(c)  _Legend for Equity Securities_. Each certificate or other representative
document for Equity Securities (including each such certificate or
representative document for Equity Securities issued upon any permitted
transfer of Equity Securities) shall contain a legend in substantially the
following form:

"THE [TYPE OF EQUITY SECURITIES] REPRESENTED BY
THIS [CERTIFICATE/REPRESENTATIVE DOCUMENT] ARE SUBJECT TO VOTING RESTRICTIONS
WITH RESPECT TO [SHARES/WARRANTS, ETC.] HELD BY PERSONS OR ENTITIES THAT FAIL
TO QUALIFY AS "CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES" AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED BY
RELEVANT LEGISLATION. SUCH VOTING RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED
AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF AMR CORPORATION, AS THE SAME MAY
BE AMENDED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME. A COMPLETE AND CORRECT COPY OF SUCH
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION SHALL BE FURNISHED FREE OF
CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF SUCH SHARES OF [TYPE OF EQUITY SECURITIES] UPON
WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF AMR CORPORATION."

8 (ii) The restrictions contained in this Section 6 are for the purposes of
reducing the risk that any "ownership change" (as defined in the Tax Code)
with respect to the Corporation may limit the Corporations ability to utilize
its Tax Benefits. In connection therewith, and to provide for
effective policing of these provisions, any Person who desires to effect an
otherwise Prohibited Transfer (a " _Requesting Person_ ") shall, prior to the
date of such transaction for which the Requesting Person seeks authorization
(the " _Proposed Transaction_ "), request in writing (a " _Request_ ") that
the Board review the Proposed Transaction and authorize or not authorize the
Proposed Transaction in accordance with this Section 6(c). A Request shall be
mailed or delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporations
principal place of business. Such Request shall be deemed to have been
received by the Corporation when actually received by the Corporation. A
Request shall include: (1) the name, address and telephone number of the
Requesting Person; (2) the number and Percentage Stock Ownership of
Corporation Securities (by type) then beneficially owned by the Requesting
Person; (3) a reasonably detailed description of the Proposed Transaction or
Proposed Transactions for which the Requesting Person seeks authorization; and
(4) a request that the Board authorize the Proposed Transaction pursuant to
this Section 6(c). The Board shall, in good faith, endeavor to respond to
each Request within twenty (20) business days of receiving such Request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Board to respond during such
twenty (20) day period shall not be deemed to be a consent to the Transfer.
The Board may authorize a Proposed Transaction unless the Board determines in
good faith that the Proposed Transaction, considered alone or with other
transactions (including, without limitation, past transactions or
contemplated transactions), would create a material risk that the
Corporations Tax Benefits may be jeopardized. Any determination by the Board
not to authorize a Proposed Transaction shall cause such Proposed Transaction
to be deemed a Prohibited Transfer. The Board may impose any conditions that
it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with authorizing any
Proposed Transaction. In addition, the Board may require an affidavit or
representations from such Requesting Person or opinions of counsel to be
rendered by counsel selected by the Requesting Person (and reasonably
acceptable to the Board), in each case, as to such matters as the Board may
reasonably determine with respect to the preservation of the Tax Benefits.
Any Requesting Person who makes a Request to the Board shall reimburse the
Corporation, within 30 days of demand therefor, for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Corporation with respect to any
Proposed Transaction, including, without limitation, the Corporations
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in determining whether to authorize the
Proposed Transaction, which costs may include, but are not limited to, any
expenses of counsel and/or tax advisors engaged by the Board to advise the
Board or deliver an opinion thereto. The Board may require, as a condition to
its consideration of the Request, that the Requesting Person execute an
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Corporation providing for
the reimbursement of such costs and expenses. Any authorization of the Board
hereunder may be given prospectively or retroactively.

 



9 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may determine that
the restrictions set forth in Section 6(b) shall not apply to any particular
transaction or transactions, whether or not a request has been made to the
Board, including a Request pursuant to this Section 6(c), subject to any
conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection therewith.
Any determination of the Board hereunder may be made prospectively or
retroactively. Following 180 days after the Effective Date, the Board will
undertake a review of whether any general exception to the disposition
restrictions in Section 6(b)(i) is appropriate.

(iv) The Board, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the
authority granted by this Section 6 through duly authorized officers or agents
of the Corporation. Nothing in this Section 6(c) shall be construed to limit
or restrict the Board in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

(d) _Legend; Notation_. The Board may require that any certificates
representing shares of Corporation Securities issued prior to the Restriction
Release Date shall contain a conspicuous legend in substantially the following
form, evidencing the restrictions set forth in this Section 6:

 

"THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE CORPORATION, AS
THE SAME MAY BE AMENDED AND RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE "CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION"), CONTAINS CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER (AS
DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION) OF CORPORATION SECURITIES (AS
DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION), INCLUDING COMMON STOCK AND
PREFERRED STOCK OF THE CORPORATION, WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CORPORATION IF SUCH TRANSFER MAY AFFECT THE
PERCENTAGE OF STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 382 OF
THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE "CODE")
AND THE TREASURY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER) THAT IS TREATED AS OWNED
BY A "SUBSTANTIAL STOCKHOLDER" AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.
A COMPLETE AND CORRECT COPY OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION SHALL BE
FURNISHED FREE OF CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE UPON
WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF AMR CORPORATION."

 

The Corporation shall have the power to make appropriate notations upon its
stock transfer records and to instruct any transfer agent,
registrar, securities intermediary or depository with respect to the
requirements of this Section 6 for any uncertificated Corporation Securities
or Corporation Securities held in an indirect holding system, and the
Corporation shall provide notice of the restrictions on transfer and
ownership to holders of uncertificated shares in accordance with applicable
law.

(e) _Treatment of Excess Securities_.

 



10 (i) No officer, employee or agent of the Corporation shall record
any Prohibited Transfer, and the Purported Transferee shall not be recognized
as a stockholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of
the Excess Securities. Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another
Person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported
Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any
rights of stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the
right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or
distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any.
Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a
Prohibited Transfer, the Corporation Securities shall cease to be
Excess Securities. For this purpose, any transfer of Excess Securities not in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall also be a Prohibited
Transfer.

 

(ii) If the Board determines that a Transfer of Corporation Securities
constitutes a Prohibited Transfer pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii), then, upon
written demand by the Corporation, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or
cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the
Excess Securities within the Purported Transferees possession or control,
together with any Prohibited Distributions, to the Agent. The Agent shall
thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Corporation, the
Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arms-length transactions
(over the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange on
which the Corporation Securities may be traded, if possible, or otherwise
privately); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Agent shall effect such sale
or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such
sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale
or sales would disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise
would adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities. If the
Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the
Corporations demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the
Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for
the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited
Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the
Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a
portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported
Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 6(e)(iv) if
the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess
Securities. 

(iii) If the Board determines that a Transfer of Corporation Securities
constitutes a Prohibited Transfer pursuant to Section 6(b)(i), the purported
transferor of such Prohibited Transfer (the " _Purported Transferor_ ") shall,
upon written demand by the Corporation, deliver to the Agent the sales
proceeds from the Prohibited Transfer (in the form received, _i.e.,_ whether
in cash or other property), and the Agent shall thereupon sell any non-cash
consideration to a buyer or buyers in one or more arms-length transactions
(including over a national securities exchange, if possible). If the
Purported Transferee is determinable (other than with respect to a transaction
entered into through the facilities of a national securities exchange) and any
Excess Securities have not been resold, the Agent (after deducting amounts
necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection

 



11  with its duties hereunder) shall, to the extent possible, return the Excess
Securities and Prohibited Distributions to the Purported Transferor, and shall
reimburse the Purported Transferee from the sales proceeds received from the
Purported Transferor (or the proceeds from the disposition of any non-cash
consideration) for the cost of any Excess Securities. If the Purported
Transferee is not determinable, or to the extent the Excess Securities have
been resold and thus cannot be returned to the Purported Transferor, the Agent
(after deducting amounts necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in
connection with its duties hereunder) shall use the proceeds to acquire
on behalf of the Purported Transferor, in one or more arms-length
transactions (including over a national securities exchange on which the
Corporation Securities may be traded, if possible), an equal amount of
Corporation Securities in replacement of the Excess Securities sold;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent the amount of proceeds is not
sufficient to fund the purchase price of such Corporation Securities and the
Agents costs and expenses, the Purported Transferor shall promptly fund such
amounts upon demand by the Agent. Any remaining amounts held by the Agent
shall be paid in accordance with Section 6(e)(iv)(C).

 

(iv) The Agent shall apply any proceeds or any other amounts received by it in
accordance with Section 6(e)(ii) as follows: (A) first, such amounts shall be
paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses
incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (B) second, any remaining
amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by
the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the case of any
Prohibited Transfer by gift, devise or inheritance or any other Prohibited
Transfer without consideration, the fair market value, (1) calculated on the
basis of the closing market price for the Corporation Securities on the day
before the Prohibited Transfer, (2) if the Corporation Securities are not
listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange but are traded in the
over-the-counter market, calculated based upon the difference between the
highest bid and lowest asked prices, as such prices are reported by the
relevant inter-dealer quotation service or any successor system on the day
before the Prohibited Transfer or, if none, on the last preceding day for
which such quotations exist, or (3) if the Corporation Securities are neither
listed nor admitted to trading on any stock exchange nor traded in the over-
the-counter market, then as determined in good faith by the Board), which
amount (or fair market value) shall be determined at the discretion of the
Board; and (C) third, any remaining amounts, subject to the limitations
imposed by the following proviso, shall be paid to one or more organizations
qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Tax Code (or any comparable
successor provision) selected by the Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Excess Securities (including any Excess Securities arising from a
previous Prohibited Transfer not sold by the Agent in a prior sale or sales)
represent a 4.75% or greater Percentage Stock Ownership in any class of
Corporation Securities, then any such remaining amounts to the extent
attributable to the disposition of the portion of such Excess Securities
exceeding a 4.75% Percentage Stock Ownership interest in such class shall be
paid to two or more organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the
Tax Code selected by the Board, such that no organization qualifying under
section 501(c)(3) of the Tax Code shall be deemed to possess a Percentage
Stock Ownership in excess of 4.74%. The recourse of any Purported Transferee
in respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount payable
to the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (B) of the preceding sentence.
In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to
this Section 6(e) inure to the benefit of the Corporation.

 



12 (v) In the event of any Transfer that does not involve a transfer
of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of Delaware law ("
_Securities_ ," and individually, a " _Security_ ") but which would cause a
Substantial Stockholder to violate a restriction on Transfers provided for
in Section 6(b), the application of Sections 6(e)(ii), (iii) and (iv) shall
be modified as described in this Section 6(e)(v). In such case, no such
Substantial Stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is
not a Security, but such Substantial Stockholder and/or any Person whose
ownership of Securities is attributed to such Substantial Stockholder shall
(x) in the case of Section 6(e)(ii), be deemed to have disposed of and shall
be required to dispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be
disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such
Substantial Stockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of
this Section 6, and (y) in the case of Section 6(e)(iii), follow the process
as reasonably determined by the Board to cause such Substantial Stockholder to
remedy or mitigate its violation of Section 6(b)(i). Such disposition or
process shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise
to the application of this provision, and in the case of clause (x) in the
preceding sentence, such number of Securities that are deemed to be disposed
of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of through the
Agent as provided in Sections 6(e)(ii) and 6(e)(iv), except that the maximum
aggregate amount payable either to such Substantial Stockholder, or to such
other Person that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities, in
connection with such sale shall be the fair market value of such Excess
Securities at the time of the purported Transfer. All expenses incurred by the
Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts
due such Substantial Stockholder or such other Person. The purpose of this
Section 6(e)(v) is to extend the restrictions in Sections 6(b), 6(e)(ii), and
6(e)(iii) to situations in which there is a Prohibited Transfer without a
direct Transfer of Securities, and this Section 6(e)(v), along with the other
provisions of this Section 6, shall be interpreted to produce the same
results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of
Corporation Securities.

(vi) If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or
the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the
date on which the Corporation makes a written demand pursuant to Section
6(e)(ii) or (iii), then the Corporation shall use its best efforts to enforce
the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to
compel the surrender. Nothing in this Section 6(e)(vi) shall (A) be deemed to
be inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in this
Section 6 to be void _ab initio_ , or (B) preclude the Corporation in its
discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand.
The Board may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give
effect to the provisions of this Section 6\.

 



13 (vii) The Corporation shall make the written demand described in Section
6(e)(ii) or (iii), as applicable, within 30 days of the date on which the
Board determines that the attempted Transfer would result in Excess
Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Corporation makes such
demand at a later date, the provisions of Section 6 shall apply nonetheless.
No failure by the Corporation to act within the time periods set forth in
Section 6(e) shall constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the Corporation
under this Section 6\.

(f) _Obligation to Provide Information_. At the request of the Corporation,
any Person that is a beneficial, legal or record holder of Corporation
Securities, and any proposed transferor or transferee and any Person
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the proposed
transferor or transferee, shall provide such information as the Corporation
may reasonably request as may be necessary from time to time in order to
determine compliance with this Section 6 or the status of the Corporations
Tax Benefits. In furtherance thereof, as a condition to the registration of
the Transfer of any Corporation Securities, any Person who is a beneficial,
legal or record holder of Corporation Securities, and any proposed Transferee
and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with
the proposed Transferee, shall provide an affidavit containing such
information as the Corporation may reasonably request from time to time in
order to determine compliance with this Section 6 or the status of the Tax
Benefits of the Corporation. 

(g) _Board Authority_.

(i) The Board shall have the power to interpret or determine in its sole
discretion all matters necessary for assessing compliance with this Section 6,
including, without limitation, (i) the identification of Substantial
Stockholders, (ii) whether a Transfer is a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) whether
to exempt a Transfer, (iv) the Percentage Stock Ownership of any Substantial
Stockholder, (v) whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security,
(vi) the amount (or fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant
to clause (B) of Section 6(e)(iv), and (vii) any other matters which the Board
determines to be relevant; and the good faith determination of the Board on
such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all the purposes of this
Section 6\.

(ii) In addition, the Board may, to the extent permitted by law, from time to
time establish, modify, amend or rescind bylaws, regulations and procedures of
the Corporation not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 6 for
purposes of determining whether any Transfer of Corporation Securities would
jeopardize the Corporations ability to preserve and use the Tax Benefits and
for the orderly application, administration and implementation of this
Section 6\.

(iii) Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit the authority of the
Board to take such other action to the extent permitted by law as it deems
necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and its stockholders in
preserving the Tax Benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
in the event of a change in law making one or more of the following actions
necessary or desirable, the Board may, by adopting a written resolution, (A)
modify the ownership interest percentage in the Corporation or the Persons
covered by this Section 6, (B) modify the definitions of any terms set forth
in this Section 6 or (C) modify the terms of this Section 6 as appropriate, in
each case, in

 



14  order to prevent an ownership change for purposes of section 382 of the Tax
Code as a result of any changes in applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board shall not cause there to
be such modification unless it determines, by adopting a written resolution,
that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to preserve the Tax
Benefits or that the continuation of these restrictions is no longer
reasonably necessary for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. Stockholders of
the Corporation shall be notified of such determination through a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or such other method of notice as
the Secretary of the Corporation shall deem appropriate.

(iv) In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions
of this Section 6, including any definition used herein, the Board shall have
the power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any
situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or knowledge of the
circumstances. In the event this Section 6 requires an action by the Board but
fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board
shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as
such action is not contrary to the provisions of this Section 6\. All such
actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or
made by the Board in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation, the Agent, and all other parties for all other purposes of this
Section 6\. The Board may delegate all or any portion of its duties and powers
under this Section 6 to a committee of the Board as it deems necessary or
advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the
authority granted by this Section 6 through duly authorized officers or agents
of the Corporation. Nothing in this Section 6 shall be construed to limit or
restrict the Board in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

(h) _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation and
the members of the Board shall be fully protected in relying in good faith
upon the information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief executive
officer, the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer, the
Secretary or the corporate controller of the Corporation or of the
Corporations legal counsel, independent auditors, transfer agent, investment
bankers or other employees and agents in making the determinations and
findings contemplated by this Section 6, and the members of the Board shall
not be responsible for any good faith errors made in connection therewith. For
purposes of determining the existence and identity of, and the amount of any
Corporation Securities owned by any stockholder, the Corporation is entitled
to rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedule 13D or 13G under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of
any date, subject to its actual knowledge of the ownership of
Corporation Securities.

(i) _Benefits of this Section 6_. Nothing in this Section 6 shall be
construed to give to any Person other than the Corporation or the Agent any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Section 6\. This Section
6 shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Corporation and the
Agent.

 



15 (j) _Severability_. The purpose of this Section 6 is to facilitate
the Corporations ability to maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If any
provision of this Section 6 or the application of any such provision to any
Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision of this Section 6\.

(k) _Waiver_. With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or
otherwise available to the Corporation or the Agent under this Section 6, (i)
no waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a writing signed by
the waiving party, and (ii) no alteration, modification or impairment will be
implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of time, delay or omission
in exercise, or other indulgence.

provisions of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation, and the Bylaws;
_provided_ , _however_ , the amendment or repeal of any provision of the

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

OF

[AMR CORPORATION]1

(hereinafter called the " _Corporation_ ")

Adopted [ ], 2013

* * * * * * * * * * * 

 

ARTICLE I __

_Offices_

The registered office of the Corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, Delaware. The Corporation may also have offices at such
other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine.

 

ARTICLE II __

_Meetings of Stockholders_

SECTION 1.  _ _Annual Meetings__. The annual meeting of stockholders for the
election of Directors shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, at which meeting the
stockholders shall elect a Board of Directors pursuant to _Article III_
hereof and may transact such other business as may properly come before the
meeting in accordance with _Section 7_ of this _Article II_.

 

SECTION 2\. __Special Meetings__. Unless otherwise required by law or the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be
amended, restated or supplemented from time to time (the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ "), special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, may only be called by either (i) the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the Board of Directors.
At a special meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as
shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto). The
ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders is
hereby specifically denied.

 

SECTION 3\. __Location of Meetings__. All meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose may be held, within or without the State of Delaware, at such time
and place as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting
of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 





   1  | The name of the corporation will be changed to American Airlines
Group Inc. in a subsequent amendment also to be implemented in connection with
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the
Plan of Reorganization. SECTION 4\. __List of Stockholders__. The Secretary shall cause to be
prepared a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
the stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of
each stockholder and number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. The Corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail
addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane
to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the
election of the Corporation, either: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, _provided_ that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the Corporations principal executive office. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means
of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 

SECTION 5\. __Voting__. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the rules or regulations of
any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, any question brought before
any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of Directors, shall
be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total
number of votes of the Corporations capital stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter, voting as a single class. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, each
stockholder entitled to vote shall, at every meeting of the stockholders, be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy (as described below) for each share
of voting stock held by him. Such right to vote shall be subject to the right
of the Board of Directors to fix a record date for voting stockholders as
hereinafter provided. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the
Officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in
such Officers discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting
shall be cast by written ballot. Any action required or permitted to be taken
by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called
annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation.

SECTION 6\. __Proxies__. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed
proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and
only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support
an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether
the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended when the person
executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to
vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of
the interest appears on the face of the

 



2  proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights
referred to in the proxy, notwithstanding the presence of the person executing
the proxy. At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting
commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to
and examined by the Secretary or a person designated by the Secretary, and no
shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be
invalid or irregular.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall
constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

(a) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed to
such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

 

(b) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a
telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who
will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, _provided_ that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can
be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission
was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams,
cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if
there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
specify the information, on which they relied.

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; _provided_ , _however_ , that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

SECTION 7\. __Nature of Business at Meetings of Stockholders__.

 

(a) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) brought before
the meeting by the Board of Directors and specified in a notice of meeting
given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder present in person who (A)
(1) was a beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation both at the time of
giving the notice provided for in this _Article II_ ,  _Section 7_ and at
the time of

 



3  the meeting, (2) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (3) has complied
with this _Article II_ , _Section 7_ in all applicable respects, or (B)
properly made such proposal in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (as so amended and inclusive of such rules and regulations, the "
_Exchange Act_ "). The foregoing clause (ii) shall be the exclusive means for
a stockholder to propose business to be brought before an annual meeting of
the stockholders. Stockholders shall not be permitted to propose business to
be brought before a special meeting of the stockholders, and the only matters
that may be brought before a special meeting are the matters specified in the
notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the person calling the
meeting pursuant to _Article II_ , _Section 2_. For purposes of this
_Article II_ , _Section 7_, "present in person" shall mean that the
stockholder proposing that the business be brought before the annual meeting
of the Corporation, or, if the proposing stockholder is not an individual, a
qualified representative of such proposing stockholder, appear at such annual
meeting. A "qualified representative" of such proposing stockholder shall be,
if such proposing stockholder is (i) a general or limited partnership, any
general partner or person who functions as a general partner of the general or
limited partnership or who controls the general or limited partnership, (ii) a
trust, any trustee of the trust, or (iii) a corporation, limited liability
company or other entity, any officer or person who functions as an officer of
the corporation, limited liability company or other entity or any officer,
director, general partner or person who functions as an officer, director or
general partner of any entity ultimately in control of the corporation,
limited liability company or other entity. Stockholders seeking to nominate
persons for election to the Board of Directors must comply with _Article
III_, _Sections 2_  and _7_ , and this _Article II_ , _Section 7_ shall not
be applicable to nominations except as expressly provided in _Article III_ ,
_Sections 2_ and _7_.

 

(b) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be
properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder
must (i) provide Timely Notice (as defined below) thereof in writing and in
proper form to the Secretary of the Corporation and (ii) provide any updates
or supplements to such notice at the times and in the forms required by this
_Article II_ , _Section 7_. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be
delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of
the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the
one-year anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before
or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must
be so delivered, or mailed and received, not later than the 90th day prior to
such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth day following the day on which
public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was first made (such
notice within such time periods, " _Timely Notice_ "). In no event shall any
adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period for the giving of Timely Notice as described above.

 

(c) To be in proper form for purposes of this _Article II_ , _Section 7_, a
stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth:

(i) As to each Proposing Person (as defined below), (A) the name and address
of such Proposing Person (including, if applicable, the name and address

 



4  that appear on the Corporations books and records); and (B) the class or
series and number of shares of the Corporation that are, directly or
indirectly, owned of record or beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by such Proposing Persons, except that such
Proposing Person shall in all events be deemed to beneficially own any shares

filed on Schedule 14A or (2) tenders of securities from such other person in a

to any business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting, each
Proposing Person shall comply with all applicable requirements of the

the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting
is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of

manner specified by these Bylaws. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that
results from an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by a
majority of the Board of Directors then in office, _provided_ that a quorum is
present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be
filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, even if less

at the Election Meeting shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a
plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented and entitled to vote at
such meeting with respect to the election of such Director. For purposes of

not counted as votes cast as either "for" or "against" such Directors
election). In an election other than a Contested Election, stockholders will
be given the choice to cast votes "for" or "against" the election of Directors
or to "abstain" from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any
other vote with respect to such election of Directors. In a Contested
Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast "for" or "withhold"
votes for the election of Directors and shall not have the ability to cast
any other vote

 



13  with respect to such election of Directors. In the event an Election Meeting

series, the determination as to whether an election constitutes a Contested
Election shall be made on a class by class or series by series basis, as
applicable.

 

SECTION 4\. __Powers of Directors__. The business, property and affairs of the

such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done
by the stockholders.

SECTION 5\. __Compensation__. The Board of Directors shall have the authority
to fix the compensation of Directors.

SECTION 6\. __Resignations of Directors__. Any Director of the Corporation
may resign at any time, by giving notice in writing or by electronic
transmission to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the
Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect when
delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date determined
upon the happening of an event or events. Unless otherwise specified in such
notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

for the Board of Directors to determine the eligibility of such candidate for
nomination to be an independent Director of the Corporation in accordance with
the Corporations Corporate Governance Guidelines.

such candidate for nomination were a Nominating Person. The chairman of the
meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not
properly made in accordance with _Article III_ , _Section 2_ and this 
_Section 7_, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare
such determination to the meeting, the defective nomination shall be
disregarded and any ballots cast for the candidate in question (but in the
case of any form of ballot listing other qualified nominees, only the ballots

ARTICLE VI __

_Indemnification_

SECTION 1\. __Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation__. Subject to _Section 3_ of this
_Article VI_ , the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the

  



17  Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or Officer of the
Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful.

 

SECTION 2\. __Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the
Right of the Corporation__. Subject to _Section 3_ of this _Article VI_ ,
the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or Officer
of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or Officer of the Corporation
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 

SECTION 3\. __Authorization of Indemnification__. Any indemnification under
this _Article VI_ (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former Director or Officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in _Section 1_ or _Section 2_ of this _Article VI_ , as the case
may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a
Director or Officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote
of the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even
though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a Committee of such Directors designated
by a majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum, or
(iii) if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders.
Such determination shall be made, with respect to former Directors and

 



18  Officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter
on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former
Director or Officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the
necessity of authorization in the specific case.

SECTION 4\. __Good Faith Defined__. For purposes of any determination under
_Section 3_ of this _Article VI_ , a person shall be deemed to have acted in
good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on the
records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on
information supplied to such person by the Officers of the Corporation or
officers of another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the
advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on
information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another
enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an
appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or
another enterprise. The provisions of this _Section 4_ shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be
deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in _Section
1_ or _Section 2_ of this _Article VI_ , as the case may be.

SECTION 5\. __Indemnification by a Court__. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under _Section 3_ of this _Article VI_ ,
and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any Director
or Officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any
other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under _Section 1_ or
_Section 2_ of this _Article VI_. The basis of such indemnification by a
court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the
Director or Officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in _Section 1_ or _Section
2_ of this _Article VI_ , as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination
in the specific case under  _Section 3_ of this _Article VI_ nor the absence
of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or
create a presumption that the Director or Officer seeking indemnification has
not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5_ shall be given to the
Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in
whole or in part, the Director or Officer seeking indemnification shall also
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

SECTION 6.  _ _Expenses Payable in Advance__. Subject to applicable law,
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a current or former Director
or Officer of the Corporation, or a current or former Director or Officer
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or

  



19  investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this _Article VI_. Subject to
applicable law, such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Corporation deems appropriate.

SECTION 7\. __Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses__.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this  _Article VI_ shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that
indemnification of the persons specified in  _Section 1_ and _Section 2_ of
this _Article VI_ shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any person who is not specified in _Section 1_ or
_Section 2_ of this _Article VI_ but whom the Corporation has the power or
obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise,
including pursuant to _Section 12_ of this _Article VI_.

SECTION 8\. __Insurance__. The Corporation shall purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or Officer of the
Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of this _Article VI_.

SECTION 9\. __Certain Definitions__. For purposes of this _Article VI_ ,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such
constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this _Article VI_ with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The term
"another enterprise" as used in this _Article VI_ shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of
this _Article VI_ , references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and

 



20  references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director or Officer with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed
to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this _Article VI_.

 

SECTION 10\. __Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses__. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this _Article VI_ shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
Director or Officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

SECTION 11\. __Limitation on Indemnification__. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Article VI_ to the contrary, except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by
_Section 5_ of this _Article VI_ ), the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify any current or former Director or Officer (or his or her heirs,
executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation.

SECTION 12.  _ _Indemnification of Employees and Agents__. The Corporation
may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors,
provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to
employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this
_Article VI_ to Directors and Officers of the Corporation.

 

SECTION 13\. __Amendment or Repeal_._ The provisions of this _Article VI_
shall constitute a contract between the Corporation, on the one hand, and, on
the other hand, each individual who serves or has served as a Director or
Officer of the Corporation (whether before or after the adoption of these
Bylaws), in consideration of such persons performance of such services, and
pursuant to this _Article VI_ the Corporation intends to be legally bound to
each such current or former Director or Officer of the Corporation. With
respect to current and former Directors and Officers of the Corporation, the
rights conferred under this _Article VI_ are present contractual rights and
such rights are fully vested, and shall be deemed to have vested fully,
immediately upon adoption of these Bylaws. With respect to any Directors
or Officers of the Corporation who commence service following adoption of
these Bylaws, the rights conferred under this provision shall be present
contractual rights and such rights shall fully vest, and be deemed to have
vested fully, immediately upon such Director or Officer commencing service as
a Director or Officer of the Corporation. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this _Article VI_ shall not adversely affect any right
or protection (i) hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification or (ii) under any
agreement providing for indemnification or

 



21  advancement of expenses to an Officer or Director of the Corporation in
effect prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

In case any Officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any certificate or
certificates of stock, shall have ceased to be an Officer, transfer agent or
registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such
certificate or certificates is issued and delivered by the Corporation, such
certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered by
the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such Officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 

SECTION 2\. __Lost Certificates__. If a certificate of stock is lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Board of Directors may, at its discretion, direct a new
certificate or uncertificated shares to be issued by the Corporation in its
stead upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the
certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the giving of a
satisfactory bond of indemnity, in an amount sufficient to indemnify the

 



25  Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. A certificate or
uncertificated shares may be issued without requiring bond when, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper to do so.

SECTION 3\. __Transfers__. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in
the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of
stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named
in the stock records of the Corporation or by such persons attorney lawfully
constituted in writing and upon the surrender of any certificate therefor,
properly endorsed for transfer (or by delivery of duly executed instructions
with respect to uncertificated shares) and payment of all necessary transfer
taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such surrender and endorsement or payment
of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the Officers of the
Corporation shall determine to waive such requirement. Every certificate
exchanged, returned or surrendered to the Corporation shall be marked
"Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the Secretary of
the Corporation or the transfer agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be
valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been
entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and
to whom transferred. 

SECTION 4\. __Dividend Record Date__. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the
record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

 

SECTION 5\. __Stockholders of Record__. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the
owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold
liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner
of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim
to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person,
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise required by law.

 

ARTICLE IX __

_Notices_

SECTION 1\. __Notices__. Whenever written notice is required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any stockholder,
such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such stockholder, at such
persons address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the
time when the same shall be deposited in the United States

 



26  mail. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission if
consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent
shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.
Any such consent shall be deemed to be revoked if (i) the Corporation is
unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices by the
Corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability
becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent,
or other person responsible for the giving of notice; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by electronic
transmission, as described above, shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (a)
such posting and (b) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any
other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
Notice to Directors or Committee members may be given personally, by mail as
described above, or by telegram, telex, cable or by means of electronic
transmission.

 

SECTION 2\. __Waivers of Notice__. Whenever any notice is required by
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given
to any Director, member of a Committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in
writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the
person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of
stockholders or any regular or special meeting of the Directors or members of
a Committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice
unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

ARTICLE XIII __

_Limitations of Ownership by Non-Citizens_

 

SECTION 1\. __Equity Securities__. All (a) capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Corporation, (b) securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests in the Corporation, or (c) options, warrants or other rights to
acquire the securities described in clauses (a) and (b), whether fixed or
contingent, matured or unmatured, contractual, legal, equitable or otherwise

 



28  (collectively, " _Equity Securities_ ") shall be subject to limitations set
forth in this _Article XIII_.

 

SECTION 2\. __Non-Citizen Voting and Ownership Limitations__. It is the policy
of the Corporation that, consistent with the requirements of Subtitle VII of
Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended, or as the same may be from
time to time amended (the " _Aviation Act_ "), that any person or entity who
is not a "citizen of the United States" (as defined in Section 40102(a)(15)
of the Aviation Act and administrative interpretations issued by the
Department of Transportation, its predecessors and successors, from time to
time), including any agent, trustee or representative of such person or
entity (a " _Non-Citizen_ "), shall not own (beneficially or of record) and/or
control more than (a) 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all outstanding Equity
Securities of the Corporation (the " _Voting Cap Amount_ ") or (b) 49.9% of
the number of outstanding shares of Equity Securities of the Corporation (the
_"Absolute Cap Amount_ " and, together with the Voting Cap Amount, the "
_Cap Amounts_ "). If Non-Citizens nonetheless at any time own and/or control
more than the Voting Cap Amount, the voting rights of the Equity Securities in
excess of the Voting Cap Amount shall be automatically suspended in accordance
with  _Section 3_ below. Further, if at any time a transfer of Equity
Securities to a Non-Citizen would result in Non-Citizens owning more than the
Absolute Cap Amount, such transfer shall be void and of no effect, in
accordance with  _Section 3_ below.

SECTION 3\. __Foreign Stock Record__. The Corporation or any transfer agent
shall maintain a separate stock record, designated the " _Foreign Stock
Record_ ," for the registration of Equity Securities held by Non-Citizens. It
is the duty of each stockholder who is a Non-Citizen to register his, her or
its Equity Securities on the Foreign Stock Record. The beneficial ownership of
Equity Securities by Non-Citizens shall be determined in conformity with
regulations prescribed by the Board of Directors. The Foreign Stock Record
shall include (i) the name and nationality of each Non-Citizen and (ii) the
date of registration of such Equity Securities in the Foreign Stock Record. In
no event shall Equity Securities registered on the Foreign Stock Record
representing more than the Voting Cap Amount be voted. In the event that Non-
Citizens shall own (beneficially or of record) or have voting control over any
Equity Securities, the voting rights of such persons shall be subject to
automatic suspension to the extent required to ensure that the Corporation is
in compliance with applicable provisions of law and regulations relating to
ownership or control of a United States air carrier. Voting rights of Equity
Securities owned (beneficially or of record) by Non-Citizens shall be
suspended in reverse chronological order based upon the date of registration
in the Foreign Stock Record. In the event that any transfer of Equity
Securities to a Non-Citizen would result in Non-Citizens owning (beneficially
or of record) more than the Absolute Cap Amount, such transfer shall be void
and of no effect and shall not be recorded in the Foreign Stock Record or the
stock records of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation shall
determine that the Equity Securities registered on the Foreign Stock Record
or the stock records of the Corporation exceed the Absolute Cap Amount,
sufficient shares shall be removed from the Foreign Stock Record and the stock
records of the Corporation so that the number of shares entered therein does
not exceed the Absolute Cap Amount. Shares of Equity Securities shall be
removed from the Foreign Stock Record and the stock records of the Corporation
in reverse chronological 

 



29  order based on the date of registration in the Foreign Stock Record and the
stock records of the Corporation.

SECTION 4\. __Registration of Shares__. A Non-Citizen, may request, in writing
to the Secretary of the Corporation, that the Corporation register ownership
of shares held by such Non-Citizen on the Foreign Stock Record and the
Corporation shall comply with such request, subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 3_. The order in which such shares shall be registered on
the Foreign Stock Record shall be chronological, based on the date the
Corporation received a written request to so register such shares; _provided_
, that any Non-Citizen who purchases or otherwise acquires shares that are
registered on the Foreign Stock Record, may register such shares in its own
name within 30 days of such acquisition, in which event such Person will
assume the position of the seller of such shares in the chronological order of
shares registered on the Foreign Stock Record.

 

SECTION 5\. __Certification of Shares__. (a) The Corporation may by notice in
writing (which may be included in the form of proxy or ballot distributed to
stockholders in connection with the annual meeting or any special meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation, or otherwise) require a person that is a
holder of record of shares or that the Corporation knows to have, or has
reasonable cause to believe has beneficial ownership of shares to certify in
such manner as the Corporation shall deem appropriate (including by way of
execution of any form of proxy or ballot of such person) that, to the
knowledge of such person:

(1) all shares as to which such person has record ownership or
beneficial ownership are owned and controlled only by citizens of the United
States; or

(2) the number of shares of record or beneficially owned by such person that
are owned and/or controlled by Non-Citizens is as set forth in such
certificate.

(b) With respect to any shares identified in response to clause (a)(2) above,
the Corporation may require such person to provide such further information as
the Corporation may reasonably require in order to implement the provisions
of this _Article XIII_.

(c) For purposes of applying the provisions of this _Article XIII_ with
respect to any shares, in the event of the failure of any person to provide
the certificate or other information to which the Corporation is entitled
pursuant to this _Section 5_, the Corporation shall presume that the
shares in question are owned and/or controlled by Non-Citizens.
