set forth therein;

  

###

### 

  

## Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

  

## 

  

### (a) If any BRKR Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ , such BRKR Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify Sellers in writing. The BRKR Indemnified Party will provide Sellers
with prompt notice of any third-party claim in respect of which
indemnification is sought. The failure to provide either such notice will not
affect any rights hereunder except to the extent Sellers are materially
prejudiced thereby.

  

### 

  

### (b) If such claim involves a claim by a Third Party against the BRKR
Indemnified Parties, Sellers may, upon notice to the BRKR Indemnified
Parties, assume, through counsel of Sellers choosing and at Sellers
expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the BRKR Indemnified Parties
shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
that the BRKR Indemnified Parties may participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by them; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
BRKR Indemnified Parties reasonably determine that representation by the
counsel of Sellers and the BRKR Indemnified Parties may present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, then Sellers shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of the BRKR Indemnified Parties counsel. Notwithstanding anything
in this _Section 9.3_ to the contrary, Sellers may not, without the prior
written consent of the BRKR Indemnified Parties, settle or compromise any
action or consent to the entry of any judgment, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. So long as Sellers are contesting any such claim in
good faith, the BRKR Indemnified Parties shall not pay or settle any such
claim without Sellers consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
If Sellers are not contesting such claim in good faith, then the BRKR
Indemnified Parties may conduct and control, through counsel of their own
choosing and at Sellers expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and
Sellers shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. The failure of the
BRKR Indemnified Parties to participate in, conduct or control such defense
shall not relieve Sellers of any obligation they may have hereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.3_ , to
the extent a claim for which indemnification is sought by BRKR Indemnified
Parties relates to Taxes for a taxable period beginning on or before and
ending after the Closing Date, Sellers and BRKR shall jointly control any
proceeding in respect of such claim and neither party shall settle or
compromise any action or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

## Section 9.4 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under this _Article IX_ shall be (a)
increased to the extent necessary such that after payment of any net Tax cost
by the BRKR Indemnified Parties with respect to the receipt or accrual of
indemnity payments hereunder, as increased pursuant to this clause (a), the
amount remaining shall be the amount of the indemnity payment prior to any
increase pursuant to this clause (a) and (b) reduced by the amount of the net
Tax benefit actually realized by the BRKR Indemnified Parties by reason of
such Loss (as an illustrative example, clause (b) takes into account on a
present value basis any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
BRKR Indemnified Party by reason of the indemnified Loss in a Tax
jurisdiction or Tax year other than the jurisdiction or year in which such
Loss arose).

  

## 

  

## Section 9.5 _Indemnification Amounts_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this U.S.
SPA, Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the BRKR Indemnified Parties
for any Losses pursuant to this _Article IX_ to the extent they are a result
of any claim made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ unless and until the dollar
amount of all Losses in the aggregate from claims made pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ , Section 10.2(a) of the Swiss Merger Agreement and Section 9.2(a) of
the German SPA **** exceed $3,250,000, in which case Sellers will be
obligated to indemnify the BRKR Indemnified Parties for the total amount of
Losses including any amounts which would otherwise not be required to be paid
by reason of this _Section 9.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the aggregate indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to
_Sections 9.2(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ of this U.S. SPA, Sections 10.2(a), (b) or
(c) of the Swiss Merger Agreement, and Sections 9.2(a), (b) or (c) of the
German SPA exceed Ninety Two Million Dollars ($92,000,000) (the " _Indemnity
Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
BRKR Indemnified Parties right to seek indemnification hereunder for any
Losses arising out of (i) criminal activity or fraud (in each case as
determined in a final, non-appealable decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction) of Sellers or BioSpin U.S. or (ii) _Section 3.8_ (Ownership of
the Shares), _Section 3.9_ (Withholding Tax), _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization
of BioSpin U.S.), _Section 4.4_ (Capitalization of the Subsidiaries; Other
Interests) or _Section 4.17_ (Environmental) shall not be subject to, or
limited by, the limits contained in this _Section 9.5_ ; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that with respect to any Losses arising out of _Section 3.8_
(Ownership of Shares) and _Section 3.9_ (Withholding Tax), the liability of
any Seller beyond the Indemnity Cap shall be several and not joint.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall have any liability under this
_Article IX_ or otherwise under this U.S. SPA in excess of the amount set
forth opposite such Sellers name under the heading "Individual Selling
Shareholders Indemnity Cap" as set forth on _Schedule 9.5_.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) For the purpose of calculating the amount of any Loss for which a
BRKR Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this U.S. SPA,
the amount of each Loss shall be deemed to be an amount net of any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment that has
been paid by any insurer or other third party with respect thereto. The
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) actually incurred by the BRKR Indemnified Parties
in pursuing any insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment from any insurer or other third party under this _Article IX_
shall constitute additional Losses with respect to the matter for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder, except to the extent such costs and
expenses are paid or reimbursed by such insurer or other third party. In the
event that a BRKR Indemnified Party is paid by Sellers for a Loss for which
one or more insurance claims or claims against Third Parties has been or
could be made, but for which payment from such insurer or Third Party has not
been received, then such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall assign, to the
extent legally permissible, all such claims to Sellers for purposes of
recouping payment of such Loss. To the extent such assignment should not be
legally permissible, the respective BRKR Indemnified Party shall remit any
payment received, up to the amount of such Loss, from such insurance claim or
Third Party claim to Sellers.

  

### 

  

## Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. BRKR acknowledges and agrees that the
indemnification provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of BRKR against Sellers and BioSpin U.S. for any breach by
Sellers or BioSpin U.S. of the representations and warranties in this U.S.
SPA, for any failure by Sellers or BioSpin U.S. to perform and comply with
any covenants and agreements in this U.S. SPA that are required to
be complied with or performed prior to the Closing and for any failure by
Sellers or BioSpin U.S. to perform and comply with any covenants and
agreements in this U.S. SPA, except that if any of the provisions of this
U.S. SPA are not performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise
breached, BRKR shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms thereof
in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this U.S. SPA to the contrary, BRKR shall retain the right to
receive damages or other relief (including equitable relief) against BioSpin
U.S. or Sellers as a result of any criminal activity or fraudulent action (in
each case as determined in a final, non-appealable decision by a court of
competent jurisdiction) by BioSpin U.S. or Sellers without regard to any
restriction or limitation contained herein. The indemnification obligations
contained in this _Article IX_ are obligations of Sellers and not of BioSpin
U.S.

rights under this U.S. SPA without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this U.S. SPA will apply to, be
binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and
permitted assigns of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 10.3_ , upon written notice to Sellers, BRKR shall be permitted
to assign this U.S. SPA and the rights and obligations under it to a wholly
owned, direct or indirect Subsidiary of BRKR; _provided_ , that, in the event

the other Party (a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations
of the other Party under this U.S. SPA, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations or warranties of the other Party contained in this U.S. SPA,
(c) waive compliance with any of the conditions or covenants of the other
Party contained in this U.S. SPA or (d) waive or modify performance of any of
the obligations of the other Party under this U.S. SPA; _provided_ , that no
Party may, without the prior written consent of the other Party, make or
grant such extension of time, waiver of inaccuracies or compliance or
waiver or modification of performance with respect to its representations,
warranties, conditions or covenants hereunder. Except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this U.S. SPA
will be deemed to constitute a waiver of compliance with any representations,
warranties, conditions or covenants contained in this U.S. SPA and will not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach, whether of a
similar or dissimilar nature.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; Schedules_. This U.S. SPA, the Swiss
Merger Agreement and the German SPA, which includes the schedules and
exhibits hereto and thereto, supersedes any other agreement, whether written
or oral, that may have been made or entered into by any party relating to the
matters contemplated by this U.S. SPA and such other agreements and
constitutes the entire agreement by and among the Parties relating to
these matters.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.6 _Amendments, Supplements, Etc._ This U.S. SPA may be amended
or supplemented at any time by additional written agreements as may mutually

  



        
   

  



  

## be determined by BioSpin U.S., BRKR and Sellers to be necessary, desirable
or expedient to further the purposes of this U.S. SPA or to clarify the
intention of the Parties.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.7 _Applicable Law_. This U.S. SPA shall be governed by and
construed under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (without regard
to the conflict of law principles thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this U.S. SPA or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof shall be
brought and determined in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Massachusetts or if such legal action or proceeding may not be
brought in such court for jurisdictional purposes, in the Superior Court of
Massachusetts. Each of the Parties hereby (a) irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this U.S. SPA or
any transaction contemplated hereby and waives the defense of sovereign
immunity, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court or that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) agrees
that it shall not bring any action relating to this U.S. SPA or any
transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than any Massachusetts
state or federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this U.S. SPA or the transactions
contemplated by this U.S. SPA. Each of the Parties hereby (a) certifies that
no representative, agent or attorney of the other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
has been induced to enter into this U.S. SPA and the
transactions contemplated by this U.S. SPA, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.8_.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.9 _Actions by Sellers_. Where any provision of this U.S. SPA
indicates that BioSpin U.S. will take any specified action (or refrain from
taking any specified action) or requires BioSpin U.S. to take any specified
action (or to refrain from taking any specified action), then, regardless of
whether this U.S. SPA specifically provides that Sellers will do so, Sellers
shall cause BioSpin U.S. to take such action (or to refrain from taking such
action, as applicable). Sellers will be responsible for the failure of
BioSpin U.S. to take any such action (or to refrain from taking any
such action, as applicable).

  

## 

  

## Section 10.10 _Execution in Counterparts_. This U.S. SPA may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but
all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 10.11 _Titles and Headings_. Titles and headings to sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only, and are not intended
to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this U.S. SPA.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.12 _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this U.S. SPA is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations under this U.S. SPA of Sellers on the one
hand and BRKR on the other hand will not be materially and adversely affected
thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this U.S. SPA will
be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining
provisions of this U.S. SPA will remain in full force and effect and will not
be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its
severance from this U.S. SPA and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
U.S. SPA a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.13 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange, no Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
U.S. SPA or the Ancillary Agreements without prior consultation with and
consent of BRKR and Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. A mutually agreed press release is attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this U.S. SPA were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult
to determine, and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance
of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.15 _Construction_.

### (a) Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in
this U.S. SPA, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

permitted successors and assigns.

  

### 

  

### (c) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or
in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, qualified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements and instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of

  



        
   

  



  

### statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

  

### 

  

### (d) All article, section, paragraph, schedule and exhibit references used
in this U.S. SPA are to articles, sections, paragraphs, schedules and

this U.S. SPA and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, or any similar
rule operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable
to the construction or interpretation of this U.S. SPA.

  

### 

  

## Section 10.16 _Actions by BRKR_. Any decision by BRKR relating to a
dispute or a potential dispute between BRKR and Sellers shall be subject to
