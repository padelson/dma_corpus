The  Bidding Procedures Order shall require that notices of all objections to the  Bidding Procedures shall be served upon, among other parties, counsel to the  Purchaser. Sellers shall request that the Bankruptcy Court hold the hearing on  the Bidding Procedures as soon as practicable after the filing of the Bidding  Procedures Motion consistent with the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and  applicable local rules (without requiring that the Sellers seek to have such  hearing held on shortened or expedited notice).

Purchaser shall have a superpriority administrative expense claim in the amount of the Expense Reimbursement, and Sellers shall secure an agreement from the secured creditors with a first lien on substantially all of Sellers assets that the Expense Reimbursement shall be paid by Sellers from the secured creditors collateral. The Expense Reimbursement shall be paid to Purchaser not later than ten (10) Business Days after the first date on which the last of the conditions set forth in the first sentence of this _Section_ _1.03(b)(ii)_ have been satisfied. Upon payment of the Expense Reimbursement, Sellers, their  Affiliates, and their Representatives shall be fully released and discharged  from any liability or obligation under or resulting from this Agreement (other  than those set forth in _Section 12.06_ ) and Purchaser shall not have any  other remedy or cause of action under or relating to this Agreement or any  applicable Law. 

     

 (iii) The Bidding Procedures Order shall provide that Sellers are authorized and directed to pay the Breakup Fee or the Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Bidding Procedures Order  without further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 

     

 (iv) No party (other than Purchaser) submitting any other offer to purchase the Sale  Assets or a Qualified Bid (as defined herein) shall be entitled to any expense  reimbursement or any breakup or termination fee payment. 

     

 (v) Prior to receipt by any other prospective purchaser (" _Alternative Purchaser_ ") of any information (including, but not limited to, business and financial information and access to representatives of Seller) from Seller, each Alternative Purchaser will be required to execute an appropriate (as may be  determined in the reasonable discretion of Sellers) confidentiality agreement. 

     

 (vi) An Alternative Purchaser will not be considered by Sellers as qualified to  participate in the auction process (a " _Qualified_ _Bidder_ ") contemplated by the Bid Procedures (the " _Auction_ ") unless as part of its bid, such Alternative Purchaser (A) submits to Sellers a copy of this Agreement marked to show changes (including, without limitation, the price and the specific assets to be purchased), (B) presents information to Sellers to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of Sellers that such bidder has the ability to (x) consummate the acquisition of the Sale Assets and (y) provide all non-debtor parties to the executory contracts and unexpired leases that are Assumed Liabilities with adequate assurance of future performance as contemplated by section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and (C) submits a Qualified Bid. 

   

 (vii) A "Qualified Bid" is one that is received by the Sellers on or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the Auction and (I) provides for a purchase  price for the Sale Assets (or any portion thereof) equal to at least the sum of  (A) the Purchase Price; (B) the Breakup Fee; and (C) $500,000  and contains such other terms and conditions that, in the determination of the  Sellers after consultation with the Bank Group and the Creditors Committee, otherwise constitutes a higher and better offer, (II) includes a good faith deposit in the amount equal to Purchasers Earnest Money, and (III) does not contain financing contingencies of any kind. This Agreement shall be deemed to be a Qualified Bid and Purchaser shall be deemed to be a Qualified  Bidder. Sellers shall, not later than three Business Days prior to the Auction,  provide Purchaser with a list of the Qualified Bidders, the amounts of the  Qualified Bids and, to the extent that any Qualified Bid contains consideration  other than cash, a description of the form of such consideration. 

     

 (viii) The Bidding Procedures Order will provide that the asset purchase agreement entered into with respect to the Winning Bid shall require that the closing date under such agreement be no later than the later of: (i) 15 Business Days after the entry of the 363/365 Order and (ii) 3 Business Days after all of the other  third party consents are obtained. If one or more Qualified Bids (in  addition to this Agreement) are submitted in accordance with the Bidding  Procedures, Sellers will conduct a public outcry Auction. At the commencement of the Auction, Sellers shall announce the highest and best overbid. Thereafter, any overbids must be higher in value than the then current highest and best overbid in an amount not less than $500,000. In the event that a Qualified Bidder seeks to increase its bid with some form of consideration other than cash, the Qualified Bidder shall be required to identify the form of  consideration in connection with making its bid (provided that such Qualified  Bidder must have included notice of such consideration in its initial Qualified  Bid). When no Qualified Bidder has submitted an overbid within the hour after  the last bid, Sellers, in consultation with the Bank Group and the  Creditors Committee, shall have the right to select the highest or  otherwise best offer from any Qualified Bidder (the _"Winning  Bid_ "). Sellers will inform all Qualified Bidders of the basis for  determining that the Winning Bid is the highest or otherwise best offer. Any  Qualified Bidder that believes its last bid was higher and better than the  Winning Bid will be entitled to make a presentation to the Sellers and any  representatives of the Bank Group and Creditors Committee in attendance at the Auction as to the value of its bid. Following such presentations, the  Sellers, in consultation with the Bank Group and Creditors Committee, may  identify a different bid as the Winning Bid or reopen the Auction. If a  different bid is selected as the Winning Bid, the same procedure will be  followed a second time. Following selection of the Winning Bid, Sellers, in  consultation with the Bank Group and the Creditors Committee, shall select an alternative, next highest and best bid to the Winning Bid (the " _Next  Highest Bid_ "). The bidder with the Next Highest Bid shall be required  to keep its bid open until the closing of the Winning Bid, and to close the Next Highest Bid with Sellers in the event the Winning Bid fails to close. Purchaser shall keep the highest bid made by it at the Auction open until August 31, 2005 whether or not it is the bidder with the Next Highest Bid. 

     

 (ix) Deposits made by Qualified Bidders (other than the Winning Bidder, the Next Highest Bidder and the Purchaser) shall be returned to such Qualified Bidders not later than five (5) Business Days following the Auction. The deposit made by the Winning Bidder shall be credited against the purchase price paid by the Winning Bidder or, if the Winning Bidder materially breaches the terms of its winning bid, retained by Sellers. In the event Sellers close with the Winning Bidder, the deposit made by the Next Highest Bidder shall be returned to the Next Highest Bidder within five (5) Business Days of such closing. The Earnest Money shall be applied in accordance with _Section 1.03(c)_. 

    

 (x) Only the Qualified Bidders who submitted Qualified Bids, any other person permitted to participate in the Auction by order of the Bankruptcy Court and Purchaser may participate in the Auction. Sellers agree that they will not request the Bankruptcy Court to authorize participation in the Auction by any person not submitting a Qualified Bid. 

   

 (xi) With Purchasers prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld),  Sellers shall be entitled to adopt, in consultation with the Bank Group and the  Creditors Committee, additional rules for the conduct of the auction not  inconsistent with the Bidding Procedures. 

   

 (c) Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver a deposit (the " _Earnest Money_ ") in the amount of $1.5 million, payable by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. funds to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be deposited into a separate, interest bearing account, accompanied by Purchasers federal tax identification number, all in accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement. Interest earned on the Earnest Money shall be credited to and become part of the Earnest Money. The Earnest Money shall be held by the Escrow Agent and disbursed in accordance with one of the following provisions, whichever shall apply: 

    

 (i) If the Closing occurs, then at Closing, the amount of the Earnest Money shall be  credited toward the Purchase Price and paid to Sellers; 

   

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_ or  _(h)_ (in the event all conditions to the Closing are satisfied (other  than conditions which are to be performed by Sellers at the Closing Date, in  which case Sellers must be ready, willing and able to comply with such  conditions) so as to permit the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date, but  the Closing has not occurred solely due to Purchasers failure to satisfy  the closing conditions set forth in _Sections 7.03_ or _7.07_ (including, without limitation, failure to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.05_ )), then, in accordance with the timing and procedures set forth in the Deposit Escrow Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be paid to Sellers; or 

    

 (iii) If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, then, in accordance with the timing and procedures set forth in the Deposit Escrow Agreement, the Earnest  Money shall be returned to Purchaser. 

    

 (d) The parties agree that amounts that may become payable pursuant to _Sections  1.03(b)(i),_ _(ii)_ or _10.03_ are reasonable and are intended to  reimburse Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, for a portion of the  expenses and other costs or harm incurred in connection with this Agreement, and are not, and are not intended to be, a penalty. 

       

 1.04 _Purchase Price; Allocation._

     

 (a) _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Sale Assets is $40,000,000 in cash (the " _Base Price_ ") plus the Assumed Liabilities, subject to any positive or negative adjustments as described in _Section 1.04(b)_ (the Base Price, plus the Assumed Liabilities and plus or minus such adjustments, the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price is payable at the Closing in the manner provided in _Section 1.05_. 

   

 (b) _Working Capital and Net Assets Adjustment_. 

    

 (i) Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Base Price shall be increased by an  amount equal to any positive Initial Adjustment Amount and any positive Final Adjustment Amount, if any, and decreased by an amount equal to any negative Initial Adjustment Amount and any negative Final Adjustment Amount, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that in no event shall the sum of the Initial Adjustment Amount and/or the Final Adjustment Amount result in a change in the Base Price of more than fifteen percent (15%). The Base Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to any negative Initial Net Assets Amount and any negative Final Net Assets Amount. 

     

 (ii) Not later than two (2) days prior to Closing, Sellers shall present Purchaser  with the Initial Adjustment Statement and Initial Net Assets Statement  (collectively, the " _Initial Statements_ "). At the Closing,  Purchaser shall pay the Base Price as increased or decreased by the Initial Adjustment Amount and Initial Net Assets Amount, if any, set forth on the Initial Statements. Prior to Sellers delivery of the Initial Statements, Sellers shall, at the reasonable request of Purchaser, meet with Purchaser to discuss the Initial Statements, provided that such right to meet and discuss the Initial Statements shall not provide Purchaser with a right to dispute the Working Capital amount or Net Assets amount set forth in the Initial Statements, and such amounts shall be deemed final for purposes of determining the Initial Adjustment Amount and the Initial Net Assets Amount. 

    

 (iii) Sellers shall provide Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives with  reasonable access to Sellers books and records to assist Purchaser in verifying the Initial Adjustment Amount and the Initial Net Assets Amount and, after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall grant Sellers and their Affiliates and Representatives access at reasonable times and places to all former Employees hired by Purchaser (provided that Purchaser shall have the right to be present at any meeting held between Sellers and any such former Employee) and the books and records relating to the Business, Sale Assets and the Assumed Liabilities that are reasonably requested in connection with Sellers preparation of the Final Adjustment Statement and the Final Net Assets Statement (collectively, the " _Final Statements_ "). 

   

 (iv) On or prior to the 45th day after the Closing, Sellers shall present  Purchaser with the Final Statements, which include any adjustments resulting from a physical count of the Inventory conducted as of approximately August 31, 2005. The Final Statements shall become final and binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser as to the Final Adjustment Amount and the Final Net Assets Amount on the 10th day following the date the Final Statements are received by Purchaser, unless prior to the 10th day Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers written notice of Purchasers disagreement with the contents of either of the Final Statements (the " _Disputed Items_ "). The written notice shall set forth all Disputed Items together with Purchasers proposed changes to such  Disputed Items. If Purchaser delivers a timely written notice, then Purchaser and Sellers shall use their good faith efforts to reach a written agreement on the Disputed Items to determine the Final Adjustment Amount and the Final Net Assets Amount. If all of the Disputed Items have not been resolved by the fifteenth (15th) day following Purchasers receipt of the relevant Final Statement, the Disputed Items shall be submitted to binding arbitration by an independent accounting firm mutually selected by Purchaser and Sellers (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). In the event Purchaser and Sellers are unable to mutually select the Independent Accountant firm by the twentieth (20th) day after Purchasers receipt of the relevant Final Statement, the matter shall be brought before the Bankruptcy Court for the Bankruptcy Court to appoint an Independent Accountant to serve as the arbitrator.

 (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the first sentence of paragraph (a) above, in no event shall any funds provided to Sellers through its  affiliate relationships between January 1, 2005 and April 30, 2005 be deducted from Working Capital in computing the Initial Adjustment Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount.

 (c) If, in order properly to prepare its Tax Returns, other documents or reports  required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or its  financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder, it is necessary  that a party be furnished with additional information, documents or records  relating to the Business not referred to in paragraph (b) above, and such  information, documents or records are in the possession or control of the other  party, such other party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or make available such information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the recipients request, cost and expense. Any information obtained by such party in accordance with this paragraph shall be held confidential by such party in accordance with _Section 12.06_. 

    

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, if the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance paragraph (c) of this Section shall be subject to applicable rules relating to discovery.

Sellers expressly acknowledge that they have sole liability for all compensation and employee benefit costs accrued as of the Closing Date and as between Purchaser and Sellers, for all medical, workmens compensation and other similar costs and expenses for any employee condition, illness or injury, unless the employee becomes an employee of Purchaser and then only for such condition, illness or injury which arose before the employee became an employee of Purchaser, whether or not any or all of such employees are subsequently hired by Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall retain all liabilities and obligations relating to its benefit plans, including without limitation any liabilities or obligations relating to any employee pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and that Purchaser does not assume the sponsorship of, the responsibility of contributions to, or any liabilities in connection with any benefit plan. 

     

 (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) below and except that a portion of Sellers severance payments at the Closing Date shall be included in the working capital adjustment as provided in _Section 1.04(b)_ , Purchaser shall have no obligation to provide severance benefits on behalf of any of the Employees. Sellers acknowledge that they are solely responsible for issuing, serving and delivering all orders and notices required, if any, pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ "), as  amended, in connection with the termination of employees of Sellers prior to the Closing Date and for any financial obligations and liabilities in connection therewith or otherwise required in connection with the termination of the Employees. 

     

 (d) Sellers will permit Purchaser to meet with Employees prior to the Closing to arrange for the transition of ownership and to discuss employment with Purchaser, and Purchaser may meet with management and headquarters personnel of Sellers, provided that (i) such meetings shall be held during normal business hours and in such a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations and (ii) Sellers and its Representatives shall have the right to be present at any such meetings. 

     

 (e) If Purchaser hires any Employee but, within 45 days after the Closing Date, (i)  terminates such Employee, (ii) with respect to any Employee covered under  Sellers Key Employee Retention Plan, materially changes such Employees  compensation or responsibility from such currently provided by or held with  Sellers, or requires the location of employment to be outside of a 35 mile  radius of such Employees current location of employment, or (iii) with  respect to any other Employee, materially changes such Employees compensation from such compensation currently provided by Sellers, or requires the location of employment to be outside of a 35 mile radius of such Employees current location of employment, then Purchaser agrees to pay such Employee any severance amounts to which such Employee would have been entitled, based on Sellers severance arrangements as in effect as of June 1, 2005 and as disclosed to Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officer of each party as of the date first above written.
