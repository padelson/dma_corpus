day after Purchaser&#146;s receipt of the relevant                Final Statement, the
matter shall be brought before the Bankruptcy Court for the                Bankruptcy
Court to appoint an Independent Accountant to serve as the                arbitrator. The
Independent Accountant (i) shall render a final determination                only with
respect to the Disputed Items, (ii) shall utilize the Accounting
               Principles and the Accounting Adjustments without modification and (iii)
shall                not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item                claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by                either party. Any finding by the Independent Accountant
shall be a reasoned                award stating in reasonable detail the findings of
fact (if any) on which it is                based, shall be final, non-appealable and
binding upon the parties and shall be                the sole and exclusive remedy
between the parties regarding the Disputed Items.                The fees and expenses of
the services of the Independent Accountant shall be                borne by Sellers, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, in the same                proportion that the
dollar amount of Disputed Items which are not resolved in                favor of Sellers
or Purchaser (as applicable) bears to the total dollar amount                of Disputed
Items resolved by the Independent Accountant. For illustration                purposes
only, (A)&nbsp;if the total amount of Disputed Items by Purchaser is

Purchaser,                on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other, shall bear the
Independent                Accountant&#146;s fees and expenses equally; or (B)&nbsp;if
the total amount of                Disputed Items by Purchaser is $1,000, and Purchaser
is awarded $250 by the                Independent Accountants, Purchaser shall bear
seventy-five percent (75%) and                Sellers shall bear twenty-five percent
(25%) of the Independent                Accountant&#146;s fees and expenses. Each of
Sellers and Purchaser shall bear                the fees, costs and expenses of its own

matters contemplated by this <U>Section                1.04(b)</U>.  </FONT></P>

Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License or any claim or right or any
