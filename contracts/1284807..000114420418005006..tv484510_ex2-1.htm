date of incorporation, registered office and registered agent, respectively,
of the Company and (ii) any references naming the incorporator(s), original

amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
further amended as provided for therein or by applicable Law (and subject to
_Section 5.9_ ).

  



  

(c) The parties hereto shall take all necessary action (including, if
necessary, by the Company procuring resignations of directors of the Company
as of the Effective Time), such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time and shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of

Company Subsidiaries (or certain of the Company Subsidiaries as indicated by
Parent) to tender their resignations as directors, effective as of the
Effective Time, and to deliver to Parent written evidence of such resignations
at the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_ _._ At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital
stock, each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Shares_ _. _ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of Shares the following shall occur:

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) Each Share (including Shares of Restricted Stock) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
any Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ and (ii) any Appraisal
Shares) shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive $21.64 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing
any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with _Section 1.7_.

  



  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned
by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Appraisal Rights_ _. _ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 1.5(a)_ , but rather shall be canceled
and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under
Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive such rights under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
1.5(a)_ , without interest thereon. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
in writing of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of
any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.7 _Surrender of Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the
Company's transfer agent or a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which shall provide for the
payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 1.7_. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and
cause the Merger Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent at or prior to the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by the Paying Agent in
accordance with this _Article 1_ , the cash necessary to pay for the Shares
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Payment Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in short term commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in money market funds investing solely in a combination of
the foregoing; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligation under this Agreement. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on
deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent
otherwise directs.

  



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_ _._ As soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record
of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.5_ , (i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting
the surrender of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal
letter shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in

the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in
accordance with this _Section 1.7_ the Merger Consideration in respect of the

or providing an indemnity in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger

thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares
affected thereby, including the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately
adjusted.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be

involved (except as otherwise noted therein) and present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial position and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the

any of the Company Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including, any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

  



  

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required
by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information concerning the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is made known on a
timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Company's filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents,
including the "principal executive officer" and the "principal financial
officer" as such terms are defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such

management or other employees who have a significant role in internal control
over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement a true and complete summary of any disclosure of
the type described in the preceding sentence made by management to the

Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant (who is a natural person) of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries , or for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
any liability (each, whether or not material, a " _Company Employee Plan_
"). For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the

made available to Parent a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company
Employee Plan (or a written description thereof if such plan is not set forth
in a written document), (ii) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed
with the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), (iii) each trust agreement,

benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued to the extent required by GAAP, except as would not reasonably be

result in any material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, except in

delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will, alone or in conjunction with any other

any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant (who is a
natural person) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any
Company Employee Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable to any

documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder.

occupancy agreement, in each case including all amendments thereto, demising

are, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions, valid and binding
obligations of the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries and, to the

Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority necessary to
enable it to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted, except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Merger Sub_ _._ Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging
in the Merger. Since the date of its incorporation and prior to the Effective

Agreement, to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and
Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger has been duly authorized by the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and, subject to the
adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
which shall occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
(including any vote of any class or series of outstanding capital stock of
Parent) are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each
of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger
Sub have, by resolutions duly adopted by the requisite vote of the directors
present at a meeting of each such board, and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement
and the Merger.

  



  

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub nor the performance or consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, will (i) result in
a violation or breach of or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) result in a violation or breach of or
conflict with any provisions of, or result in the loss of any material
benefit under or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination, cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase (including
pursuant to any right of first refusal or the like) under, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets owned or operated by Parent or Merger Sub under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or (iii) subject to obtaining or
making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings referred to in _Section 3.3(d)_ below, violate any
Judgment or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets other than any such event or events described in items
(ii) or (iii) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub that have
been provided to the Company are complete and correct copies of such documents
and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

(d) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
necessary to be obtained or made by Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with Parent's or Merger Sub's execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, except for (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate corresponding documents with the appropriate authorities of other
states in which the Company is qualified as a foreign corporation to
transact business, (ii) compliance with the HSR Act, (iii) compliance with
the Exchange Act (including the filing with the SEC of such reports under
Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act) and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as may be required in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger, (iv) compliance with the rules of the NYSE, (v) compliance
with the "blue sky" Laws of various states, and (vi) such consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings,

not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.4 _Disclosure Documents_ _._ None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in Information Statement will, at the time such
document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or
at the time it is first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is
made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Financing_ _._  Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company (x) an equity commitment
letter from Clayton, Dubilier and Rice Fund X, L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ "), dated
as of the date hereof, addressed to Parent (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_
", and the financing contemplated thereby, the " _Equity Financing_ ") and
(y) a debt commitment letter from the lenders party thereto (the " _Committed
Lenders_ ") and the arrangers party thereto , dated as of the date hereof,
addressed to Parent (including all annexes, exhibits, schedules and other
attachments thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and the financing
contemplated thereby, the " _Debt Financing_ ", and the Debt Financing,
together with Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "), pursuant to which the
Committed Lenders have committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the
Financing is funded on the Closing Date in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, the amount of funding to be provided in the Financing is sufficient
to consummate the Merger, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment
of the Option Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Restricted
Stock under  _Section 1.8_ and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
that may be contemplated in the Merger and the payment of all related fees
and expenses. The Debt Commitment Letter and the terms of the Financing
contemplated thereby (including the definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith) do not and will not prohibit the payment of any amounts
payable under the TRA required by Section 5.11. As of the date hereof, the
Commitments Letters are in full force and effect and have not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As
of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, there are no other legally binding
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing (other
than (i) the fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter, a true and
complete copy of which has been provided to the Company, with only the
existence and/or amount of fees, "market flex" terms, pricing terms, pricing
caps and other commercially sensitive information specified therein redacted,
none of which redacted terms, individually or in the aggregate, would reduce
the amount of the Debt Financing below an amount necessary (together with the
Equity Financing) to make all payments required by this Agreement or
adversely affect the conditionality, availability or termination of the Debt
Financing or delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt
Financing less likely to occur (" _Permissible Redacted Terms_ ") (such fee
letter, the " _Fee Letter_ ") or (ii) customary engagement letters or non-
disclosure agreements which do not impact the terms or conditionality of the
Financing). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters. As
of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing (including any
"market flex" provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter. Parent has fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Commitment Letters to be paid by it or Merger Sub on or prior to the date of
this Agreement. As of the date hereof, and assuming the truth and accuracy of
the representations set forth in _Article 2_ , each of Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the timing of the Pisces
Marketing Period) any of the terms or conditions to funding to be satisfied by
it contained in the Commitment Letters. For the avoidance of doubt, subject
to the provisions of _Article 7_ , each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
that its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms set forth herein are not conditioned upon (i) the
availability or consummation of the Financings (or any Alternative Financing)
or receipt of the proceeds therefrom, (ii) the availability of any equity or
debt financing relating to the Atlas Purchase Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby or (iii) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Atlas Purchase Agreement. Parent has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of the limited guarantee of the Sponsor,
dated as of the date hereof (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). The Limited
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsor.

  



    

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.6 _Absence of Litigation_ _._ There are no suits,
actions, claims or legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings or
governmental or regulatory investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened, to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, that materially affects the assets of Parent or Merger
Sub, except, individually or in the aggregate, as have not had and would not
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent
or its Subsidiaries is subject to any Judgments that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_ _._ None of Parent
or any of Parent's "affiliates" or "associates" directly or indirectly
"owns," and at all times during the three-year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of Parent or any of Parent's "affiliates" or
"associates" directly or indirectly has "owned," beneficially or otherwise,
any of the outstanding Company Common Stock, as those terms are defined in

Section 3.8 _Broker 's or Finder's Fees_ _._ No agent, broker,
investment banker, or similar Person or firm acting on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary or under Parent's, Merger Sub's
or any Parent Subsidiary's authority is or will be entitled to any advisory,
commission or broker's or finder's fee or similar fee or commission from any
of the parties hereto in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Other Agreements or Understandings_ _._ Parent has
disclosed to the Company all contracts, arrangements or understandings
(and, with respect to those that are written, Parent has furnished to the
Company correct and complete copies thereof) between or among Parent, Merger
Sub or any Affiliate of Parent, on the one hand, and any member of the Company
Board or management or a stockholder of the Company, on the other hand.

the representations and warranties set forth in _Article 2_ are true and
correct in all material respects, (ii) that the most recent financial
forecasts for the Company made available to Parent prior to the date hereof
have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue
to be reasonable, (iii) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's
and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, without giving effect to the Financing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole are Solvent (as defined below), immediately
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, and the Option
Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Restricted Stock under
_Section 1.8_ and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated in the Merger, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be
Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 3.10_ , the term "Solvent" means (i)
(a) the Fair Value and Present Fair Saleable Value of the assets of such
person and its subsidiaries taken as a whole exceed their Stated Liabilities
and the Identified Contingent Liabilities; (b) such person and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole do not have Unreasonably Small Capital; and (c)

"Identified Contingent Liabilities", "will be able to pay their Stated
Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature" and "Do not
have Unreasonably Small Capital" each have the meanings specified in Annex I
to Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Vote and Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary
to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
(which was delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement) is
the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct
the operations of the Company prior to the Closing. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions hereof, complete control and supervision of its and its
Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Conduct of Business by Parent and Merger Sub Pending
the Merger_ _._ Parent and Merger Sub agree that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, they shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company, take or cause
to be taken any action, including any action with respect to any actions or
filings that would be required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act and other
applicable Antitrust Laws, that would reasonably be expected to materially
delay, impair or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or propose, announce an intention, enter into any agreement or
otherwise make a commitment to take any such action. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent's entry into the Atlas Purchase Agreement and performance of its
obligations thereunder will not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
4.2_.

  



  

ARTICLE 5 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

Section 5.1 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, the Company Employee Plans, in each
case in accordance with their terms as in effect as of the date hereof (or as
modified thereafter as to the extent permitted by _Section 4.1(b)(xi)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any bonus
program implemented in the Ordinary Course of Business in respect of fiscal
year 2018. From and after the Effective Time until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_
"), other than any Company Employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, (i) a base salary and annual cash bonus and commission opportunity
no less favorable than provided to such employees immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based
compensation, long-term cash incentives, transaction-based compensation, non-
recurring compensation and severance that is addressed by _Section 5.1(c)_
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (subject
to the same exclusions) provided to such employees immediately before the
Effective Time.

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of
benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall, subject to applicable Law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors
before the Effective Time, to the same extent that such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under
any similar Company Employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, retirement welfare
plan, or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that each Company Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such New Plan is comparable to
the Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

  



  

(c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an
employment agreement providing for severance benefits upon termination) is
terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date under
circumstances under which such Company Employee would have received severance
benefits under the Company's severance practices as in existence as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits
from the Surviving Corporation that are consistent with past practice.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions
of this _Section 5.1_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.1_ , express or implied, shall
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 5.1_ , and no Company Employee or other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this _Section 5.1_ , including with respect to (i)
obligating Parent or the Surviving Corporation to retain the employment of
any particular employee, (ii) preventing Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement or (iii) altering
any at-will employment relationship of any Company Employee or constituting a
guarantee of continued employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement express or implied, shall be construed to
constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Company
Employee Plans.

Section 5.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

  



  

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following the date hereof), file or cause to be filed with
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and any comparable foreign antitrust or competition
authority any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act or
comparable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to

and other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) respond to any government requests
or requests of a party hereto for information under any Antitrust Law, (iii)
contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or
judicial action, and (iv) have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any

(c) In furtherance of, and not in limitation to, the provisions of
_Section 5.2(b)_ , Parent agrees to promptly take, and cause its Affiliates
to take, all actions and steps required by any Governmental Authority as a
condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance
and approvals, and to cause the timely expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, the
DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any other jurisdiction for which
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the
Merger prior to the Termination Date, so as to obtain such consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable
following the date hereof, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the
FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Authorities under Antitrust Laws, and to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or materially
delaying the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date,
including (x) negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or
disposition of any assets, rights, product lines, or businesses of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with
respect to the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that any such action or commitment to take any such action is binding on
Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Company and each Company Subsidiary only in the
event the Closing occurs. Parent shall defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain,
delay, or prevent the Closing by the Termination Date; _provided_ , that such
litigation in no way limits the obligation of Parent pursuant to the
foregoing sentence. Parent shall pay all filing fees payable pursuant to the
HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws (if any).

(d) The parties agree not to extend directly or indirectly any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable foreign Antitrust
Law (including by withdrawing and refiling any filing pursuant to the HSR Act
or applicable foreign Antitrust Law) or enter into any agreement with a
Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the Merger, except with
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub and the Company shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any
written communication to that party from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and, subject to
applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the
other party's reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend, and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Public Statements_ _._ Subject to _Section 5.8_ , the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each
other prior to issuing, and to provide each other with the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any public announcement, statement or other
disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Merger, except as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange
or trading market; _provided_ , _however_ , that these restrictions shall not
apply to any Company communications regarding either (a) a Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal, or (b) a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures of information by or on behalf of CI Capital Partners LLC,
Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC or their respective Affiliates or successors,
on the one hand, to their respective direct and indirect potential investors,
Affiliates, financing sources, counsel, accountants, consultants and others,
on the other hand (so long as, in each case, such disclosure has a valid
business purpose and is effected in a manner consistent with customary
private equity practices). The parties shall issue a joint press release,

Section 5.4 _Stockholders ' Written Consent; Information
Statement_ _._

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Company
shall use its best efforts to secure the irrevocable written consent, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of holders of capital stock of
the Company holding at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares of
such capital stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger (the " _Written Consent_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable, and
in any event within eight (8) hours, after the execution of this
Agreement. As promptly as practicable after receipt of the Written Consent,
and in any event within eight (8) hours of the signing of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission) of the executed Written Consent,
certified as true and complete by an executive officer of the Company. In
connection with the Written Consent, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to comply, and shall comply in all respects, with the DGCL,
including Section 228 thereof, and the Company Charter Documents.

  



  

(b) If the Written Consent is delivered to Parent, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by

Sub will furnish the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Information Statement. The Company shall not file the
Information Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(which comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to
consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC comments
with respect to the Information Statement as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof and to cause the Information Statement in definitive form to
be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to

amendment to the Information Statement or for additional information and (ii)
provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Information Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Information Statement (i) except for
information provided to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub, will not on the
date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the Effective
Time contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. If, at any time prior to the
date that is twenty (20) days after the Information Statement is first mailed
to the Company's stockholders, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. In the event the Written Consent is not obtained
and Parent does not terminate this Agreement, then the Company shall, as soon
as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement related to the
Merger and this Agreement and shall take all action necessary to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of adopting this Agreement and use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Required Vote at such meeting.

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Standard of Efforts_ _._ Except as otherwise
specified herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to take or cause to be taken), all action, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger. The Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that they shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_ _._ Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide prompt notice to the Company (and each
will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any material
developments related to such notices), of such party becoming aware of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not being
able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date.

Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall afford, and

employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford, the
officers, employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable
access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance written notice,
and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business
operations, to the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' officers,
employees, properties, facilities, books, records, correspondence (in each
case, whether in physical or electronic form), contracts and other assets as
Parent shall reasonably request (provided that such access shall not include
invasive sampling of building materials or the environment at any Real
Property that is leased or licensed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary),
all other such information concerning its and the Company Subsidiaries'
business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as Parent through its
officers, employees or agents may reasonably request, (B) that are in the
possession, custody or control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and (C) the disclosure of which would not violate any Law, cause to be waived
the attorney-client privilege or other similar privilege with respect to any
material matter ( _provided_ , that such privilege cannot in the Company's
good faith judgment be reasonably sufficiently protected using a joint
defense or other similar agreement), result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any obligation of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality; _provided_  that the
Company and/or its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to communicate to
Parent the requested information in a way that would not waive any applicable
attorney-client privilege or contravene any applicable Law or confidentiality
agreement, as applicable, including seeking any necessary consents from third
parties. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and
agents will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b) Until the Effective Time, at which time the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated October 30, 2017 between Clayton, Dubilier and Rice LLC and Ply
Gem Industries, Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

Section 5.8 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.8_ , the Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and direct its and their
respective officers, directors and other Representatives to, (i) immediately
cease any and all activities, discussions or negotiations that commenced
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal and
(ii) promptly following the receipt of the Company Required Vote deliver
written notice to each such Person with whom the Company had discussions or
negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal during the prior year (A)
informing such Person that the Company is immediately terminating all
activities, discussions and negotiations with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and (B) directing that all such Persons and their
Representatives return or destroy all copies of confidential information
previously provided to such parties by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the extent any
confidentiality agreement with such Person so provides or allows.

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.8,_ from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries, and direct its and their respective officers,
directors and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission
of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) approve,
publicly recommend or endorse, execute or enter into any
agreement, agreement-in-principle, term sheet or letter of intent providing
for or accepting any Takeover Proposal or any proposal or offer that is
reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (iii) amend or grant any
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv)
other than informing third parties of the existence of the provisions
contained in this _Section 5.8_ , participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information,
or afford access to personnel, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, for the purpose of knowingly assisting, participating in,
encouraging or facilitating any inquires or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing or otherwise
authorize or direct any of its Representatives to take any such action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and before the receipt of the
Company Required Vote that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.8_ , and subject to compliance with _Section 5.8(c)_ , the Company
or its Representatives may contact the Person or its Representatives
making such Takeover Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof
and, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Required Vote (but
in no event after such time) do any or all of the following: (X) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal and such Person's Representatives, but
only pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on terms substantially
similar to, and no less restrictive in any material respect than, the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement shall
contain additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with
the provisions of _Section 5.8(c)_ ), _provided_ , that (1) such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for
an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company (any such confidentiality
agreement described in this clause (X), an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and (2) concurrently with its delivery to such Person, the
Company delivers or makes available to Parent all such non-public information
not previously provided to Parent; or (Y) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations (including the solicitation of revised Takeover
Proposals) with such Person and such Person's Representatives and its
potential financing sources regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in no event
later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt, notify Parent of
the Company's receipt of any written Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any
such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such Takeover Proposal),
and thereafter shall promptly, and in no event later than forty-eight (48)
hours after the occurrence of any material developments, keep
Parent reasonably informed of such material developments affecting the status
and terms of any such Takeover Proposal (and the Company shall provide or
make available to Parent copies of any documents regarding such Takeover
Proposal received by the Company from the Person making such Takeover
Proposal or such Person's Representatives).

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.8_ , neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Board Recommendation, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal or (iii) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions (any action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to
as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (v) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or authorize or direct any
of their respective Representatives to, enter into any agreement, agreement-
in-principle or letter of intent providing for any Takeover Proposal, other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Required Vote, but
not after, if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Takeover
Proposal that has not been withdrawn and the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor), that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (A) the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Company may terminate this
Agreement to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to such
Takeover Proposal, in each case, if and only if: (X) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the outside counsel, that
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (Y) the Company shall have given
Parent prior written notice of its intention to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ at least three (3) Business Days prior to making any such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or termination) and (Z) (1) the Company shall
have provided to Parent all material terms and conditions of the Takeover
Proposal, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the three (3) Business Days
after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that such Takeover Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (3) after giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent (which are not revocable by Parent for at least
three (3) Business Days), if any, after consultation with outside counsel, the
Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Takeover
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that failure to make the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this _Section 5.8(e)_ shall also apply to any
material amendment to any Takeover Proposal and require a new Determination
Notice, except that the references to three (3) Business Days shall be deemed
to be two (2) Business Days.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or in _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly
or indirectly through their respective Representatives, from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company Board or other committee
thereof take any action prohibited by _Section 5.8(d)_ except as permitted by
the terms of _Section 5.8(d)_.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of
expenses, indemnification and exculpation by the Company and any
Company Subsidiary now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company's or
any Company Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger.
From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the full extent
permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement and the
Merger), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
and shall advance each Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days of
receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines
as such expenses are incurred, but subject to the Indemnifying Parties'
receipt of an unsecured undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, by or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder;  _provided_ , that nothing herein shall impair any rights to
indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred to in clause (a) above.

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, cause the individuals who have served as officers and directors
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time who are
then covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
currently maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has
been delivered or made available to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_"), to be
covered under a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms
and conditions no less advantageous to such individuals than the Company's and
any Company Subsidiary's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions of
such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
respect of this Agreement and the Merger) in their capacities as such, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; _provided_ _,_
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain
or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six-year (6) period
as much coverage as is available for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have
the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by
obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO Insurance, and
such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 5.9(c)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase such a "tail policy", and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect for its full term, in which case Parent shall be relieved from its
obligations under this _Section 5.9(c)_.

  



  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.9_  applies without the written
consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ , each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this _Section 5.9_ ). Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this
_Section 5.9_.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers
and directors of the Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company Board shall use
reasonable best efforts and take all actions to the extent necessary or as
may be reasonably requested by any party hereto in connection with this
Agreement to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any dispositions
or cancellations of equity securities of the Company (including any
derivative securities with respect to any equity securities of the Company)
held by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, and who would
otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under
Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Tax Receivable Agreement_. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit the Surviving Company or any Company Subsidiary to, enter into any
financing arrangement or any other arrangement that, or amend the terms of any
financing arrangement (including the Financing) or any other arrangement to,
prohibit the payment of any amounts payable under the TRA. Furthermore, Parent
shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or any Company
Subsidiary to, change or amend the tax reporting or accounting policies of
the Surviving Company or any Company Subsidiary in any manner that would have
the effect of reducing or prohibiting the payment of any amounts payable
under the TRA, unless Parent causes the Surviving Company to calculate and pay
any amounts due under the TRA without giving effect to any such change or
amendment, provided that the payment under the TRA in respect of the taxable
year beginning January 1, 2018 shall be determined using a 21% United States
federal income tax rate, and the Surviving Company shall amend the TRA if
necessary to give effect to such rate.

  



  

Section 5.12 _State Takeover Laws_ _._ If any "control share
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
anti-takeover applicable Law is or may become applicable to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
and their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise act to render
such anti-takeover applicable Law (or, in the case of Section 203 of the
DGCL, the restrictions on business combinations provided therein) inapplicable
to the foregoing.

Section 5.13 _Securityholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
control the defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger
or a breach of this Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any such litigation, and the right to consult on
the settlement, release, waiver or compromise of any such litigation, and the
Company shall in good faith take such comments into account, and, except as
permitted by _Section 4.1(b)(xvii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no such
settlement, release, waiver or compromise relating to the Merger shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any such litigation and shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Parties Obligations in Respect of the Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or desirable to (i) satisfy on a timely basis (taking
into account the anticipated timing of the Pisces Marketing Period) all
conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the Commitment
Letters (including definitive agreements related thereto) that are within its
control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees
required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (ii) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letters (subject to Parent's right to amend, modify, supplement,
restate, assign, substitute or replace the Commitment Letters in accordance
herewith), comply with its obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letters,
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and, with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter, negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than
those described in or contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter)
and (iii) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. If funds in the
amounts and on the terms set forth in a Debt Commitment Letter become
unavailable to Parent or Merger Sub on the terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (other than as
a result of the Company's breach of this Agreement, or if the Company's
failure to perform would be the sole cause of the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_ not to be satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company of such fact and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain as promptly as practicable alternative debt financing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") in amounts sufficient to consummate the Merger,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Option
Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Restricted Stock under
_Section 1.8_  and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated in the Merger and the payment of all related fees and expenses, 
_provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to accept any
Alternative Financing having terms and conditions less favorable to Parent
and Merger Sub than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account
any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) and the Fee Letter;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent and Merger Sub proceed with
Alternative Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be subject to the same
obligations with respect to the Alternative Financing as set forth in this
_Section 5.14(a)_ with respect to the Financing, and all references in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing", "Financing", "Debt Commitment Letter,"
"Fee Letter" and "Commitment Letters" (and other like terms in this
Agreement) shall be deemed to also include such Alternative Financing, as
applicable. In the event all conditions applicable to the Commitment Letters
have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Persons providing the Financing to fund such Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable.

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Upon request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company
apprised (as promptly as possible, and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours of material developments relating to the Financing. Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to
such Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours, (i) of any breach or default by any party to any of the Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of (A) any written notice or
(B) other written communication, in each case from any Lender Related Party
with respect to any (1) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements of which Parent
becomes aware related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund
any of the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the
Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing such that
it would not have amounts sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the payment of the Option Consideration and the consideration in
respect of the Restricted Stock under _Section 1.8_ and any other
repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Merger and
the payment of all related fees and expenses. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the
date the Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent shall not replace, amend, supplement, modify or
waive the Debt Commitment Letter or any provision of any fee letter or
engagement letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood
that the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the
Fee Letter shall not constitute a replacement, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter), without the Company's
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or
conditioned or delayed) if such replacement, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees) such that Parent would not
have amounts sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
payment of the Option Consideration and the consideration in respect of the
Restricted Stock under _Section 1.8_ and any other repayment or refinancing of
debt that may be contemplated in the Merger and the payment of all related
fees and expenses, (y) amends the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing
in a manner that adds additional conditions precedent to the Debt Financing,
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to
the availability of the Financing, in each case, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Debt Financing (or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely
to occur or (z) would reasonably be excepted to delay or prevent the Closing;
provided, that Parent may amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities (or titles with respect to such entities) that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (it being
understood that the aggregate commitments of the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter prior to such amendment, supplement or modification may be
reduced in the amount of such additional party's commitments). Parent shall
promptly provide to the Company true and complete copies of any commitment
letter and fee letter (which, in the case of a fee letter, may have
Permissible Redacted Terms) associated with a replacement Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing as well as any amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver of any Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter (which, in the
case of a fee letter, may have Permissible Redacted Terms), that is permitted
hereunder.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide,
to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case at Parent's sole cost and expense
(subject to the expense reimbursement provision in the last sentence of this
_Section 5.14(c)_ ), such cooperation as is customary and reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing,
including by:

  



  

(i) assisting in preparation for and participating in a reasonable
number of investor and lender meetings (including a reasonable and
limited number of customary one-on-one meetings and calls that are requested
in advance with or by the parties acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing),
lender due diligence presentations, drafting sessions, road shows and
presentations, including sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Debt Financing at reasonable times and locations mutually agreed, and
assisting Parent in obtaining ratings in connection with the Debt Financing;

  



  

(ii) assisting Parent and its Lender Related Parties with the
preparation by Parent and the Lender Related Parties of materials for rating
agency presentations, lender presentations, high yield road show
presentations and offering memoranda, bridge teasers, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar marketing
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing or any high yield
bonds being issued in lieu of any portion of the Debt Financing, including
furnishing records, data or other information necessary to support any
statistical information or claims relating to the Company appearing in the
aforementioned materials required in connection with the Debt Financing or
any high yield bonds being issued in lieu of any portion of the Debt
Financing, in each case to the extent, and solely to the extent, such
materials relate to information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries;

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) executing and delivering as of (but not prior to) the Closing
any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents
for the Debt Financing or any high-yield bonds being issued in lieu of all or
a portion of the Debt Financing, or other certificates or documents and back
up therefor and for legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(including, solely to the extent such Person has been appointed as chief
financial officer or treasurer (or other comparable officer) of the Borrower
(as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) on the Closing Date, executing and
delivering a certificate of the chief financial officer or treasurer (or
other comparable officer) of the Borrower substantially in the form attached
as Annex I to Exhibit E to the Debt Commitment Letter certifying the
solvency, after giving effect to (x) the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Atlas Purchase Agreement or (y) in the case of a Pisces Only Execution
or a Joint (Atlas Deferred) Execution, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby but not by the Atlas Purchase Agreement, of the Borrower
and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral; _provided_ , that (A)
none of the documents or certificates shall be executed and/or delivered
except in connection with the Closing (other than the execution of (1) the
authorization letters set forth in  _Section 5.14(c)(vii)_ below and (2) the
representation letters required by the Company's auditors in connection
with the delivery of "comfort letters" set forth in _Section 5.14(c)(x)_

Affiliates and Representatives or (2) historical information provided in
writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for use in
