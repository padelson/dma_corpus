AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March 13, 2011, by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Ohio Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and The Lubrizol Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each have approved, and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of the Companys Common Stock (such issued and outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than Dissenting Shares, Shares owned by Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, and any shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with Ohio Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving Corporation._ " 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of any such condition) set forth in _Article VII_ (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Jones Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the 

   ##### 

  

  

relevant provisions of Ohio Law (the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or
such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed
to by Parent and the Company in writing, being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of Ohio Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 6.7_ hereof). 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub: 

   ##### 

  

 

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive $135.00 in cash payable to the holder of such Share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares (" _Certificates_ ") or any book-entry Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_. All such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

  

 (b) Each share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately before the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such shares.

  

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

   

 Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. 

 

 (a) Before the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate the Companys transfer agent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_. When and as needed, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than three Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a_) (i) a letter of transmittal (which must specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and will be in such form and have such other provisions as the Company and Merger Sub may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for surrendering Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the first anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such

     ##### 

  

     

Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent under cover of the
letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid
letter of transmittal and the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered,
Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, Shares
held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
and shares held in the treasury of the Company) or Book-Entry Shares will
represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration
relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. 

  

 (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement, and in each case which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and shares held in the treasury of the Company) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.

  

 (e) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to such cash, and any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ "), which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of

     ##### 

  

     

the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to
any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

   

 Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

 

 (a) Each option to purchase shares granted under the Company Stock Plans (an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be adjusted by the applicable Company Stock Plan committee and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock previously subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share set forth in such Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), and as of the Effective Time each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The Option Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time.

  

 (b) Each award granted pursuant to a Company Plan that is maintained primarily for international employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _International Equity Plans_ ") entitling the holder thereof to shares of Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of shares of Common Stock (an " ** _International Award_** ") that is outstanding and, to the extent applicable, unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) will be settled at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable International Equity Plan but solely in cash (such cash payment, the " _Settlement Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each holder of an International Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Settlement Payment. All Settlement Payments shall be made promptly (and in any case within 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code or other applicable Law with respect to an International Award, the payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable International Equity Plan and related award agreement.

     ##### 

  

    

 (c) Each award of a right under any Company Plan (other than awards of Options, International Awards and Deferred Compensation Plans, the treatment of which is specified in _Section 2.3(a)_ , _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.3(d)_, respectively) entitling the holder thereof to shares of Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of shares of Common Stock (a " _Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall be adjusted by the applicable Company Plan committee and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) (i) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the number of shares of Common Stock determined based on performance as of the Effective Time (calculated in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Plans) and (ii) in the case of Share Units subject to time-based vesting conditions, the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Share Units, and (B) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Share Unit Payment_ "),  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Share Unit Payment shall in no case be less than if it had been determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Plans. As of the Effective Time each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Share Unit Payment. All Share Unit Payments shall be made promptly (and in any case within 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Plan and related award document. "Company Plan" for purposes of this _Section 2.3_ and _Section 3.4_, shall mean a Company Plan without regard to materiality.

  

 (d) All account balances (whether or not vested) under any Company Plan that provides for the deferral of compensation and represents amounts notionally invested in a number of shares of Common Stock or otherwise provides for distributions or benefits that are calculated based on the value of a share of Common Stock (collectively, the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_ "), shall be adjusted by the applicable Company Plan committee as of the Effective Time, and shall be converted into a right of the holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock previously deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such account and (B) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Deferred Payment_ "), and shall cease to represent a right to receive a number of shares or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of shares of Common Stock. The Deferred Payment shall be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Plan and related deferral documents.

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such lawful action as may be necessary (which includes satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

   

 Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

 

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares held by a holder who has demanded and perfected his, her or its demand for appraisal of his, her or its Shares in accordance with Ohio Law (including but not limited to Section 1701.85 of Ohio Law) and as of the Effective Time has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or

     ##### 

 

  

its right to such appraisal (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted
into or represent a right to receive cash pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, but
the holder of the Dissenting Shares will be entitled to only such rights as
are granted to holders of Dissenting Shares by Ohio Law. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_, if any holder of Shares who demands appraisal of his, her or its Shares under Ohio Law effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holders Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give Merger Sub prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Ohio Law received by the Company.

 Section 6.7 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of the Surviving Corporation, such indemnification shall only be to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under Ohio Law to indemnify its own directors and officers, and in the case of indemnification by Parent, Parents indemnification shall not be limited by Ohio Law, but Parent shall not be required to indemnify Indemnified Parties if a final, non-appealable judgment or adjudication in an action against Indemnified Parties by a claimant (not including an action brought by Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any insurer of either) establishes: (A) that the acts or omissions of Indemnified Parties were the result of deliberate criminal or fraudulent acts by the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification; or (B) that the claim against Indemnified Party arises out of, is based upon, or is attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage to which the Indemnified Party was not legally entitled. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding, but in the case of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation only to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking of the kind described in Section 1701.13(E)(5) of Ohio Law and in the form provided for in the indemnification agreements with Company directors and officers in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, _provided_ that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 6.7_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this _Section 6.7_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation (but not Parent) an undertaking of the kind described in Section 1701.13(E)(5) of Ohio Law and in the form provided for in the indemnification agreements with Company directors and officers in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 (c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Regulations (or other governing documents) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, under Ohio Law or any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of its obligations under or related to this Agreement.

 (a) For a period of two years from the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, compensation and benefits to the employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits that are provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing obligation shall not restrict Parent and the Surviving Corporation from making changes that (i) are consistent with changes currently planned or contemplated by the Company, (ii) are in response to business conditions which may exist at the time of such changes or (iii) are collectively bargained for. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all Company Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate any individual Company Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law (including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and beneficiaries of such Company Plan to the extent required thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not, after the Effective Time, provide any form of equity-based compensation, including, without limitation, options to purchase shares of capital stock in the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any equity- based compensation provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Plans immediately prior to the 

       ##### 

  

    

Effective Time (including but not limited to long term incentive compensation
grants or awards) shall be taken into account in determining whether the
compensation and benefits provided by Parent and the Surviving Corporation
are less favorable than those provided by the Company for purposes of the
first sentence of this _Section 6.9(a)_. 

   

 (b) For purposes of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other employment agreements, arrangements and policies of the Surviving Corporation under which an employees benefits depends, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit will be given to current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the Effective Time, provided that such crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 6.9_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.
