indemnification shall not be limited by Ohio Law, but Parent shall not be required to indemnify
Indemnified Parties if a final, non-appealable judgment or adjudication in an action against
Indemnified Parties by a claimant (not including an action brought by Parent, Surviving
Corporation, or any insurer of either) establishes: (A)&nbsp;that the acts or omissions of Indemnified
Parties were the result of deliberate criminal or fraudulent acts by the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification; or (B)&nbsp;that the claim against Indemnified Party arises out of, is based upon, or
is attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage to which the
Indemnified Party was not legally entitled. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding, but in the case of Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation only to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking of the kind
described in Section&nbsp;1701.13(E)(5) of Ohio Law and in the form provided for in the indemnification
agreements with Company directors and officers in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is
brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
(ii)&nbsp;Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received,
and (iii)&nbsp;Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, <U>provided</U> that none of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its
written consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this <U><B>Section&nbsp;6.7</B></U>, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this <U><B>Section&nbsp;6.7</B></U> except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation (but not Parent)
an undertaking of the kind described in Section&nbsp;1701.13(E)(5) of
Ohio Law and in the form provided for in the indemnification agreements with Company directors
and officers in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
