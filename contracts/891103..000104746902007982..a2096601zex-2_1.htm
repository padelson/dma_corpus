and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative)
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement, from funds paid to it under Section&nbsp;1.5 of this
Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and for indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses
arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct),
including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the funds paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.5 exceed the Holder Allocable
