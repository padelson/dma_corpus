 (a) _ The Merger._ 

    

 (i) _ Merger of Merger Sub into the Company._ Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "), at the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into    

 the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), continuing its
corporate existence under the MBCA as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror.
Any references herein to the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date shall be deemed references to the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

  

 (ii) _ Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time of the Merger, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the MBCA, and subject to its provisions, at the Effective Time of the Merger the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, of a public as well as a private nature, of the Constituent Corporations, and shall become subject to all the restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Constituent Corporations; and all rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each Constituent Corporation, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to each such Constituent Corporation, on whatever account, and all choses in action belonging to each such corporation, shall become vested in the Surviving Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and all and every other interest shall become thereafter the property of the Surviving Corporation as they are of the Constituent Corporations; and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise or any other interest in real estate vested by any instrument or otherwise in either of such Constituent Corporations shall not revert or become in any way impaired by reason of the Merger; but all Liens upon any property of either Constituent Corporation shall thereforth attach to the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. 

  

 (iii) _ Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers._ At the Effective Time of the Merger, (A) the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, which shall, concurrently with the Merger, be amended and restated as set forth in _Annex B _hereto; (B) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; (C) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified; and (D) the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Entertainment Publications, Inc." 

    

 (b) _ Outstanding Capital Stock of Each Constituent Corporation and Effect on Capital Stock; Merger Consideration._ 

    

 (i) _ Outstanding Capital Stock of Each Constituent Corporation._ 

    

 (A) _ The Company._ The Company has authorized capital consisting of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 15,700,960 shares are issued and outstanding on the date hereof and entitled to vote. 

   

 (B) _ Merger Sub._ Merger Sub has authorized capital consisting of 1,000 shares of common stock, no par value, of which 500 shares are issued and outstanding on the date hereof and entitled to vote. The number of outstanding shares of stock of the Merger Sub will not change prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. 

    

 (ii) _ Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, the holders of Company 

   

     

 Common Stock, Merger Sub or the holders of Merger Sub Common Stock (as
hereinafter defined), the following events shall occur:

    

 (A) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock; Cancellation of Treasury Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is then issued and outstanding (excluding treasury shares and any Management Rollover Shares) (the " _Company Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any Company Share shall thereafter represent the right to receive the aggregate per share consideration into which such Company Share was converted in the Merger, as determined pursuant to Section 1.1(d) or 1.1(e), as applicable. Each Management Rollover Share that is then issued and outstanding shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any Management Rollover Share shall thereafter represent the right to receive the aggregate per share consideration into which such Management Rollover Share was converted in the Merger, as determined pursuant to Section 1.1(f). Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be canceled and extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (B) _ Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock._ All issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") shall continue to be issued and shall be converted into 14,958.958 shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "), with each share of Merger Sub Common Stock converted into 29.917916 shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock automatically and for all purposes shall be deemed to represent the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock represented by such certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section. 

    

 (iii) _ Options._ Pursuant to Section 6.8 of the Company\'s Stock Incentive Plan, upon the giving of at least 30-days prior notice of the consummation of the Merger to the Holders of Options: (A) all outstanding Options shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (B) all outstanding Options must be exercised on or before the Effective Time of the Merger and shall terminate and shall not be exercisable at any time thereafter. The Company shall give at least 30-days prior notice to each of the Holders of Options of the Change of Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) that will occur upon the consummation of the Merger. Holders of Options who have returned a properly executed Holder Acknowledgment in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1(b)(iii) or exercised their Options, in each case on or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be entitled to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to Section 1.1(d) or 1.1(e), as applicable. 

    

 (c) The " _Cash Merger Consideration_ ", subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 1.3(a) and 1.8 hereof, shall consist of (A) an amount in cash equal to (i) $184,507,500, _minus_ (ii) Company Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (iii) the Holder Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to the Holder Representative at Closing in accordance with Section 1.5, _minus_ (iv) the Mezzanine Premium, and _minus_ , (v) the Employee Bonus Amount (plus any payroll taxes that the Surviving Corporation must pay in connection therewith). The Stock Merger Consideration shall consist of a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (i) $184,507,500 (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.1(e) or 1.3(a), the " _Stock Calculation Amount_ "), _divided by_ (ii) the Average Trading Price. 

  

  Any payments made by Acquiror pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(2) of the Registration Rights Agreement shall be accounted for as additional Cash Merger Consideration and shall be paid by the Acquiror in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. 

  

  

 (d) Subject to Section 1.1(e), the Merger Consideration (other than the shares of Surviving Corporation Class B Common Stock issuable in respect of the Management Rollover Shares (the " _Management Rollover Consideration_ ")), which is covered in Section 1.1(f)) shall be allocated among the Holders as set forth below in this subsection 1.1(d): 

    

 (i) Each Holder shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Company Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger (excluding any Company Shares issuable upon the exercise of any Options held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger), a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration equal to (x) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Share (as defined below), _multiplied by_ (y) the number of Company Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger (but not including any Company Shares issuable upon the exercise of any Options held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger). Each Holder who delivers a Holder Acknowledgment to the Acquiror prior to the Closing shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Options held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration equal to (i) the Cash Per Fully Diluted Share, _multiplied by_ the aggregate number of Company Shares issuable upon exercise in full of all Options held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, _minus_ (ii) the amount equal to the Cash Percentage of the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all Options held by such holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger. 

  

 (ii) Each Holder shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Company Shares and/or Options (if such Holder delivers a Holder Acknowledgment to the Acquiror prior to the Closing) held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to (x) the product of (i) the sum of the number of Company Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, _plus_ the aggregate number of Company Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of all Options held by such holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii) the Stock Per Fully-Diluted Share (as defined below), _minus_ (y) a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (1) the amount of the Stock Percentage of the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all Options held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, _divided by_ (2) the Average Trading Price. 

  

 (iii) The " _Cash Per Fully-Diluted Share_ " shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Cash Merger Consideration, _plus_ (B) the amount of the Cash Percentage of the Aggregate Option Exercise Price (defined below), _divided by_ (ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Shares (as defined below). The " _Stock Per Fully-Diluted Share_ " shall mean a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (i) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock comprising the Stock Merger Consideration, _plus_ (B) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (1) the amount of the Stock Percentage of the Aggregate Option Exercise Price, _divided by_ (2) the Average Trading Price, _divided by_ (ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Shares. The " _Aggregate Fully-Diluted Shares_ " shall mean (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time of the Merger, _plus_ (y) the aggregate number of Company Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of all Options outstanding as of the Effective Time of the Merger. The " _Aggregate Option Exercise Price_ " shall mean the sum of the cash exercise prices payable upon exercise in full of all outstanding Options as of the Effective Time of the Merger. 

   

     
   

 (e) Acquiror may elect to pay to all Optionholders cash in lieu of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the Optionholders would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.1(d) hereof in respect of the Company Shares and Options held by the Optionholders as of the Effective Time of the Merger by giving written notice to the Company of such election prior to the Closing. In the event that Acquiror elects to pay each Optionholder cash in lieu of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, 

    

 (i) the additional cash payment to each Optionholder shall be an amount equal to the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such Optionholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 1.1(d) if such election were not made, _multiplied_ by the Average Trading Price (payments to be made to all Optionholders hereunder to be referred to as the " _Additional Cash Payment_ "). 

  

 (ii) the Stock Calculation Amount shall be decreased by the Additional Cash Payment. 

   

 (iii) the portion of the Stock Merger Consideration to which Holders of Company Shares (other than Optionholders) will be entitled shall be calculated as follows: each such Holder shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Company Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Stock Per Outstanding Share (as defined below). For purposes of such calculation, (x) "Stock Per Outstanding Share" shall mean a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock comprising the Stock Merger Consideration, _divided by_ (b) the Aggregate Outstanding Shares, and (y) "Aggregate Outstanding Shares" shall mean the aggregate number of Company Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger _minus_ the number of Company Shares held by Optionholders as of the Effective Time of the Merger. 

  

 (iv) any conforming changes to this Agreement to reflect Acquiror\'s election pursuant to this Section 1.1(e) shall be made in an amendment to this Agreement, as reasonably agreed to by the parties hereto. 

    

 (f) Each Holder shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Management Rollover Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger, a number of shares of Class B Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Class B Stock_") equal to the product of (i) the number of Management Rollover Shares held by such Holder as of the Effective Time of the Merger multiplied by (ii) 0.0006036. 

  

  

 Section 1.2 _ Payment and Exchange of Certificates._ (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror shall instruct the transfer agent for the Acquiror Common Stock in its role as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to issue and deliver to each Holder, promptly after such Holder has surrendered the appropriate certificates representing Company Shares and a Representation Letter (or, in the case of Holders of Options, upon delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment prior to Closing), as well as any other customary documentation reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, to the Acquiror at an address designated by such Holder or otherwise at such Holder\'s direction, stock certificates representing a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock calculated in accordance with Section 1.1(d) (collectively, the " _Acquiror Certificates_ "). 

  

  

 (b) Concurrently with the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror shall pay to the Exchange Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Cash Merger Consideration (less the Initial Escrow Amount). The Exchange Agent shall pay to each Holder, promptly after such Holder has surrendered the appropriate certificates representing Company Shares (or, in the case of Options, upon delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment to the Acquiror 

  

    

 prior to Closing) to the Exchange Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by such Holder, in the case of a
Holder of Company Shares, or by check to an address designated by such
Holder, in the case of a Holder of Options, an amount equal to such Holder\'s
portion of the Cash Merger Consideration into which such Holder\'s Company
Shares and/or Options shall have been converted as a result of the Merger,
calculated in accordance with Section 1.1(d) or 1.1(e), as applicable ( _less_
a portion of such Holder\'s portion of the Cash Merger Consideration equal to
the Initial Escrow Amount, _multiplied_ by such Holder\'s Applicable
Percentage), which shall be deposited in escrow in accordance with Section
1.4 and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any payment
(including shares of Acquiror Common Stock) with respect to Options held by
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Employee Options_ ")
shall be reduced by the amount of any taxes required to be withheld under
applicable law with respect to such payments and amounts so withheld shall be
paid by the Acquiror to the Surviving Corporation for disbursement to the
applicable taxing authority. The Surviving Corporation shall issue
certificates for the Surviving Corporation Class B Common Stock to the
holders of Management Rollover Shares upon surrender of the certificates
representing Management Rollover Shares.

In the event that Acquiror elects to pay _all_ of the Stock Merger Consideration in cash rather than Acquiror Common Stock, on the Closing Date, there shall be no Stock Merger Consideration issuable in the Merger, the additional Cash Merger Consideration issuable in the Merger in lieu of any Stock Merger Consideration shall be $175.0 million and the Stock Calculation Amount shall be zero.

The Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex C_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

In no event shall the Holder Representative have any liability under this Section 1.4, nor shall any Holder have any liability under this Section 1.4 in excess of such Holder\'s Applicable Percentage of the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any distributions to any holders of Employee Options pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be net of the amount of any taxes required to be withheld from such distributions under applicable law, and the amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the Surviving Corporation for payment by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority as required by law. In no event shall any Acquiror Indemnitee be entitled to payment pursuant to this Section 1.4 of any amount in excess of the Escrow Amount, plus any interest earned thereon. 

  

 Section 1.5 _ Holder Allocable Expenses._ Within three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Holder Representative will provide to Acquiror an itemized list of the Holder Allocable Expenses (which list shall include and specifically identify such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for any Holder Allocable Expenses that are not then known or determinable).

ARTICLE VI. 
JOINT COVENANTS 

   

 Section 6.1 _ Confidentiality._ From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, each party agrees to treat all information provided by any other party pursuant to this Agreement in accordance 

     

 with the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall remain in full force and
effect, and the terms and conditions thereof are incorporated by reference
herein. The parties may, however, disclose such matters to its directors,
officers, executive employees and professional advisors and those of
prospective financing sources to such extent as may be reasonable for the
negotiation, execution and consummation of this Agreement; _provided,
however_ that each such party shall agree to keep confidential all information
concerning the other obtained pursuant to this Agreement and shall agree not
to use such information except in connection with the transactions set forth
herein. In the event that the Agreement is terminated prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, each party will return all such information
(including all copies thereof) regarding the other, to the other party and the
Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms thereof. The parties hereto recognize and agree that
in the event of a breach by a party of this section, money damages would not
be an adequate remedy to the injured party for such breach and, even if money
damages were adequate, it would be impossible to ascertain or measure with any
degree of accuracy the damages sustained by such injured party therefrom.
Accordingly, if there should be a breach or threatened breach by a party of
the provisions of this section, the injured party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including an injunction and specific performance,
restraining the breaching party from any breach or threatened breach without
showing or proving actual damage sustained by the injured party. Nothing in
the preceding sentence shall limit or otherwise affect any remedies that a
party may otherwise have under applicable law.

 (b) Acquiror and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, letters, white papers, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other foreign, federal, or state antitrust, competition, or fair trade law. In this regard but without limitation, each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication between such party and any Antitrust Authority regarding the transactions contemplated herein. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall require or be construed to require any party hereto, in order to obtain the consent or successful termination of any review of any such Antitrust Authority regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, to (i) sell or hold separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time of the Merger, any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by Acquiror or the Company, of any assets or businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or any material change in or restriction on the operation by Acquiror or the Company of any assets or businesses or (ii) enter into any agreement or be bound by any obligation that, in Acquiror\'s good faith judgment, may be reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on the benefits to Acquiror of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

  

 Section 6.3 _ Support of Transaction._ Acquiror and the Company shall each (and shall each cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Third Party Consents and any other consents and approvals of third parties that any of 

    Acquiror, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain
in order to consummate the Merger (and the Company shall promptly provide
Acquiror with written notice when any Third Party Consents set forth on
Schedule 8.2(h) have been obtained), (iii) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy
the conditions of Article VIII or otherwise to comply with this Agreement,
(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other party\'s
efforts in connection with any legal proceeding contesting the Merger, (v)
provide the other parties, and such other parties\' employees, officers,
accountants, lawyers, financial advisors and representatives with
reasonable access, during normal business hours in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Acquiror and Merger Sub, as applicable, to its personnel, properties,
business and records for any reasonable purposes related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with the defense of any
action, suit claim or proceeding, and (vi) amend this Agreement in such
manner as the parties reasonably agree is necessary to implement the intention
of the parties hereto. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Acquiror and Merger Sub agree to use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Effective Time of the Merger to occur as soon as practicable.

  

 Section 6.4 _ Update Information._ Not earlier than 10 and not less than 5 days before the date scheduled for Closing, the Company and Acquiror shall correct and supplement in writing any information furnished on Schedules provided by such party that, to the knowledge of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, is materially incorrect or incomplete, and shall promptly furnish such corrected and supplemented information to the other, so that such information shall be correct and complete to the knowledge of such party at the time such updated information is so provided. Thereafter, prior to the Closing, the Company and Acquiror shall correct and supplement in writing any information furnished on their respective Schedules that, to the knowledge of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, is materially incorrect or incomplete. It is agreed that the furnishing of such corrected and supplemental information, in and of itself, shall not create any presumption that such information constitutes or evidences the existence of a material change or any breach or violation by the Company or Acquiror of any provision of this Agreement. Any corrected and supplemental information shall not be deemed to amend the Schedules for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof have been satisfied and shall not be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty or to limit the rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement for any breach by the other parties of such representations and warranties. 

  

 Section 6.5 _ Registration Rights Agreement._ Acquiror shall, and the Company shall cause the Company Principal Shareholders to, comply in all material respects with all of the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.6 _ Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time of the Merger, any further action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all properties, interests, assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each Constituent Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.

 (e) The term " _Damages_ " as used in this Section 9.2 is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against Shareholder Indemnitees or Acquiror Indemnitees, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by such persons in the absence of third party claims, and payments by the indemnitee shall not be a condition precedent to recovery. 

  

  

 Section 9.3 _ Conduct of Proceedings._ (a) If any claim, action, suit or proceeding arising from any claim of a third-party or otherwise covered by the foregoing agreements to indemnify and hold harmless (a " _Proceeding_ ") shall arise, the party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article IX (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, within the relevant limitation period provided for in Section 9.1 above, give written notice thereof to the Holder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, or the Acquiror, as applicable (the " _Indemnitor_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the existence of such Proceeding and shall include (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party\'s failure to give the Indemnitor prompt and/or proper notice shall not limit the Indemnified Party\'s right to indemnification except to the extent that such failure has prejudiced the Indemnitor\'s ability to defend the Proceeding. 

  

  

 (b) In any Proceeding involving a claim brought by a third party, the Indemnitor shall have the right to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend against any such Proceeding, or to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the Indemnitor deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the Acquiror or the Holders, as applicable; _provided_ that, (i) the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its, or in the case of the Holder Representative, the Holders\', obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such matter; (ii) the Indemnitor shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, or consent to entry of any judgment in any Proceeding, without obtaining an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all damages in respect of the claims underlying such Proceeding; (iii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party and paid at its own expense and (iv) if in the opinion of counsel for such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party, the Acquiror or the Holders, as applicable, shall be 

  

    

 responsible for reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. The parties will fully
cooperate in any such action, and shall, to the extent not inconsistent with
the preservation of attorney-client or work product privileges, make available
to each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such
Proceeding. If the Indemnitor fails to defend against or settle such
Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake
the defense and settlement of any such Proceeding, at the Acquiror\'s or
Holders\' expense, as applicable expense; _provided_ that, if the Indemnified
Party assumes the defense of any such Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
not settle such Proceeding prior to final judgment thereon or forego any
appeal with respect thereto without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).

  

  

 Section 9.4 _ Sole Remedy; Time Limitation; Escrow._ After the Closing has occurred, the right to indemnification under this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedy of each party hereto in connection with any and all matters covered by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, an Indemnitor shall have no responsibility or obligation with respect to any claim for indemnification asserted pursuant to this Article IX unless such claim is asserted in writing by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor within the applicable survival period describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim. The Escrow Amount shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment and remedy to satisfy any claim for Damages for which any Acquiror Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a). All such Damages shall be paid by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment against the perpetrators of such fraud.
